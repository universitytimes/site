		<title>Pro-United Ireland Mandate Campaign in Queen&#039;s Receives Requisite Signatures for Referendum</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jack Leahy |</strong> <em>News Editor </em>

A campaign to achieve a pro-United Ireland mandate in Queen's University Belfast Students' Union (QUBSU), launched earlier today, has collected the requisite number of signatures to force a referendum, <em>The University Times</em> understands.

Over 700 signatures were collected today by the Queen's branch of Sinn Féin with a view to calling a referendum on the union's stance on a united Ireland. This equates to more than 2.5 per cent of the 24,000 student population in the university – the amount required by the QUBSU constitution to call a referendum.

The QUB branch of Sinn Féin made the announcement this morning that its members would be collecting signatures during QUB Freshers' Week with the view of holding a referendum on the issue.

QUBSU is now expected to call a referendum in accordance with its constitution, meaning all QUBSU students will have the opportunity to vote on its union's engagement with the issue of a united Ireland. The union's current position with regard to the matter is neutral.

The move is expected to prove controversial. In May, a motion submitted to QUBSU council called for a ban on the sale of Remembrance Day poppies in the union, citing the interests of 'inclusivity' and avoiding offence.

Claiming that poppies were "contested symbols" and represented "military triumphalism", then-QUBSU councillor Sean Fearon proposed the motion, which necessitated an elevated security presence at the meeting.

The motion was defeated by 40 votes to 15, but not before considerable national and international media attention, briefly reviving wider debates about sectarianism and the role of students' unions in divisive issues of identity.

Fearon, who proposed the motion to the council meeting, is also understood by <em>The University Times</em> to be a member of QUB Sinn Féin and involved in the collection of signatures.

Fearon's sister Megan is a Sinn Féin Member of the Legislative Assembly for the Newry/Armagh constituency.

In a post on its Facebook page, QUB Sinn Féin said that reigniting the debate had the potential to spark 'a much broader discussion' on the future of the island:

'Highlighting and discussing the positives of ending partition among the 24,000 students at QUB has the potential to spark a much broader discussion on what the future of our island could look like.

'A United Ireland is not just a republican pipe dream. It is in everyone's interest, no matter their age, gender, sexuality, race, religion, nationality, background, or identity'.

QUBSU president Ciarán Gallagher has not responded to multiple requests from <em>The University Times</em> for comment. Chairperson of the youth wing of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Clíona McCarney, however, was unimpressed with what she sees as "a sectarian head-count that benefits nobody" when she was contacted by this newspaper earlier today:

"I think this kind of debate is absolutely unhelpful, there are so many other things that our SU should be campaigning on without getting caught up in a sectarian head-count that benefits nobody."

She went on to say: "For example; cuts to higher and further education across the island of Ireland and also the potential of increased fees at Queen's. There are a plethora of other issues that our union should prioritise and we should leave the party politics out of the SU."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ben Butler</strong> | Staff Writer
I’m a pretty lazy guy at the best of times. Sure, I do marathons, but they’re usually more of the House of Cards variety than those with Asics and singlets. I’m also not much of a dancer. I’ll blindly bop along and belt out the lyrics to 'Shake it Off' in Coppers like the next fellow, but my relationship with dancing has been akin to my relationship with McDonalds, only investigated when I’m drunk and in the early hours of the morning.

Despite this, I’m always imbued with this sense of wide-eyed optimism at the start of every year. Maybe it’s that I’m just back from summer, fresh from the few glorious months of freedom. Or maybe it’s that I feel I should be working, but haven’t yet been hit with heaps of assignments. So, it was the Sunday before Freshers’ Week and Conor, the Features Editor, posted in our group. I promptly decided to embrace my short span of enthusiasm and signed up for dancing.
<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Your top half never moves? Halfway there already
</span></blockquote>
And thus, let me take you to that fateful Wednesday, Irish dancing. Why Irish dancing? Monday was hip hop, Tuesday was contemporary, and I don’t think I’m ‘street’ or sleek enough to do either. Even having never gone to Irish college, and missing out on the ceili summers at this stage I still figured I could pull it off alright. Sure, your top half never moves, right? Halfway there already!

<strong>Wednesday</strong>, 2.50pm: In another of my new college year resolutions, I’d started using the calendar on my phone to schedule lectures and the like, with notifications popping up ten minutes before. ‘Irish Dancing Class, Good luck’. I’d been up since seven manning the Enactus stand, which doesn’t seem like a lot but you really feel being awake for seven hours when you’ve only slept for three. Luckily, Cup Cafe had provided us with coffee that day and I had pretty much hooked myself up to it like an IV drip. I stumbled up to Botany Bay and threw on the ‘danciest’ clothes I have, a tshirt, a pair of way-too-skinny-to-the-point-where-I-can-never-actually-wear-them-in-real-life sweatpants, and my Ethnic Threads hoodie. I felt like I was on the way to some sort of Bieberesque boyband audition. Since I figured the aim of this was to make me look as ridiculous as possible, we were well on the way without even setting foot in the class.

I arrive up to the class to the delight of at least the only other guy. Claire (Clare? She only introduced herself orally, and it seemed weird to ask how to spell her name) cheerily welcomed us all to the class. With a solid 10:1 girl/guy ratio, and a pretty heavy international contingent, it was shaping up to be an interesting group. We started with a brief introduction to the history of Irish dancing, and then the real stuff began. Shoulders back, feet pointed out, this was all new. Claire and the DU Dance Committee, please forgive me; what follows will be a pretty hopeless description of what we did. Having only had two and a half hours sleep the night before (a lethal combination of LawSoc night out and early morning gazebo-pitching), my brain wasn’t firing on all cylinders.
<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>“Ok so if everyone could just split up into pairs…”</span></blockquote>
After a few basic ‘jigs and reels’ (I’m using jigs and reels in the most colloquial way possible: as the technical terms flew way over my head with all my focus solely on trying not to fall over), Claire put us through our paces in what I could only describe as like running through those little ladders you see at football training sessions. But, despite my inability, I was actually really enjoying it. The music is fantastic and there was a lovely atmosphere in the group. And I was just about settling into it when Claire uttered the scariest sentence that a boy in a dance class can hear: “Ok so if everyone could just split up into pairs…” AGH. Who do I go with? It’s times like this when your brain forgets that you’re a 21 year old college student and immediately reverts back to awkward 12 year old. AGH I HAVE TO HOLD HANDS WITH A GIRL, AND I STILL HAVEN’T COMPLETED GTA VICE CITY.

Luckily, like many a group work exercise in class, proximity decided the pairs. Now in tandem with a nice Erasmus student, we proceeded with the routine. Luckily, being a boy in Irish dancing is a handy enough gig, a lot of it is helping make the girl look good whilst looking equal parts exuberant and stoical.

At this stage, the class was coming to an end, and the hangover was hitting me hard, so I was happy to finish up. But I left the class feeling a little exhausted and mainly exhilarated. Chatting to Lindsay, DU Dance’s lovely Style Liason Officer, afterwards I realised that I did actually really enjoy the class.

Now that it’s October, the laziness has kicked back in, though I would definitely recommend the classes, or just getting involved with DU Dance. Lindsay, Robyn, and everyone I met on the committee were super nice and encouraging. Will I be back? Who knows, but maybe the jigs will come out next time I’m in Coppers.

Antibiotics, for instance, are chemical warfare agents synthesised by bacteria, fungi and protozoa which constantly evolve for their continuity, fitting as a snug exemplar to Darwin’s “survival of the fittest” hypothesis.

Following the discovery of penicillin in 1928, healthcare was revolutionised after successful treatment after treatment to cure life-threatening diseases with a “wonder-injection” alongside manageable side effects. Cue a huge international quest for more potent, specific antibiotics. Antibiotics then found a huge place in livery stock for a more stable food supply: copious amounts were added to milk in particular to prevent bacterial spoilage.
<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>In April of this year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the entrance into the “post antibiotic era” in their annual Antimicrobial Resistance Global Report on Surveillance.</span></blockquote>
It’s without surprise that when backing an infection-causing microbe into a metaphorical corner, it’s going to put up a fight. Hence forth, the quick-fix wonder treatments began to fail as germs smartened up and twiddled with a gene or two to ensure survival. In April of this year, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the entrance into the “post antibiotic era” in their annual Antimicrobial Resistance Global Report on Surveillance. Few new antibiotic drugs are in the pipeline. The treatment of MRSA (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin is beginning to fail evolving into VRSA (vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus) slowly in the past decade, leaving fewer avenues for treatment. Antibiotic prescribing guidelines issued to practitioners regard the use of augmentin as a second line treatment option (amoxicillin, the antibiotic which prevents bacterial wall growth and clavulanic acid, an enzyme inhibitor which blocks the breakdown of the antibiotic by the bacteria) failing the use of the antibiotic on its own.

I stress the word antibiotic, as this does not encompass the treatment of fungal or viral infections, the latter of which has sparked media interest following the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa. In the most recent WHO report, 4293 cases and 2296 deaths were confirmed as of the 8th September with an estimated 83% case fatality rate. Throughout the last ten to fifteen years, emerging contagious fatal diseases mostly come in a viral form: SARS, H5N1 avian and H1N1 swine flu to name the most infamous, sparking media explosions and international panic as there is “no cure” or a vaccine in development is only in trials. Viruses are also the main cause of a dry cough, sore throat and the flu. Being a pharmacy student, many friends and family joke at how I could develop the next blockbuster drug for cancer, with the “there’s no cure for the common cold” pub fact often cropping up. Many also tell me about how great it is to pick up antibiotics over the counter in Spain as it works for every ailment (which, for the record, it doesn’t).

With the Ebola epidemic, is there scope for a new strain to form?
“It’s highly unlikely that a new species of Ebolavirus (EBOV) could form during the current outbreak but as EBOV has a single stranded, negative sense RNA genome it can mutate relatively easily. There is evidence from a recently published Science paper that the current virus is mutating but the significance of those mutations is not yet known” explains Dr. Kim Roberts, Ussher Assistant Professor of Virology in the Department of Microbiology at TCD.

ZMapp is the controversial, experimental Ebola treatment that has been given to a small number of high profile sufferers in the western world but yet to undergo human clinical trial. It is a monoclonal antibody cocktail which shows the most promise within the development pipeline. In simple terms, mice are infected with the virus, and the antibodies that they produce are harvested. The antibodies that are most effective at blocking the virus are humanised and administered for treatment. Although monoclonals are traditionally challenging and very expensive to manufacture, genetic engineering developments have allowed a scale up of the ZMapp antibodies to be grown in the tobacco plant following viral infection. Speaking on the topic of potential resistance, Dr. Roberts describes:
“The ZMapp product is composed of 3 monoclonal antibodies that target different, non-overlapping regions of the viral glycoprotein and this should reduce the risk of escape mutants occurring. [However], whilst prolonged use of ZMapp in an infected person may generate escape mutants this does not mean that the escape mutant viruses would then be transmitted to new hosts.”

Other routes to treatment include vaccines currently in development which would allow the host to develop an immune response to the virus, however these are only due to enter phase I clinical trials next month and be in a position for trial in the most affected countries by the new year. A huge challenge following the development of these therapies is formulation and storage. Most require refrigeration to prevent degradation or else are freeze-dried with thoroughly sterilised water added prior to administration. Intravenous injection is the only route available for delivery which requires specialist training and also causes pain in the patient. While these may seem relatively easy to deal with in a developed country such as Ireland, in the most Ebola stricken countries such as Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, refrigeration through transport and storage, medical training and sharps waste for needles is not as easy to come by, making treatments incredibly challenging.

The microneedle system has been proposed as a popular solution to this issue. A small patch of miniscule spikes loaded with drug or freeze dried vaccine particles often made of silicon act by penetrating the skin’s impermeable layer (stratum corneum) and allow a route of drug delivery to the small blood vessels which are abundant within the dermal layer. Particles simply diffuse into the bloodstream and nerve endings are not affected, thus no pain involved. Although many global efforts are made in this direction, one particular research group in Ireland with an exciting future has developed the multi-patented ImmuPatch. Affiliated between the School of Pharmacy at University College Cork and the Tyndall National Institute, both a dissolvable and solid microneedle patch has been developed by the group. Vaccine particles can be added to the liquid microneedle matrix before it is quickly spray dried to its mold at a relatively low temperature, ensuring the stability of the vaccine is intact. Products of this kind could be maintained at room temperature, meaning the issue of cold-chain storage is resolved, but further cost is saved without the need for sharps incineration as this is a needle-free technology. What’s more, due to the simplicity and low risk of the product, the ImmuPatch can be self-administered, making it a much more practical product in third world countries with limited medical resources.

Although we are facing a concerning future with regard to bacterial infections, the restrictions and scale up of more profound and economical anti-viral therapies show a direction in the right avenue.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>USI&#039;s &quot;Rally for Education&quot; to be Held Ahead of Budget</title>

A rally calling for the protection of student supports in the 2015 budget will take place on Wednesday October 8th. Organised by the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), "Rally for Education" intends to "highlight the value of education to society as well as the valuable contributions that students make to their communities."

Students will march from the Garden of Remembrance on Parnell Street from 11.30 am, concluding at Molesworth Street, across the road from Leinster House, where a number of speeches and artistic performances will take place. 

In September, Dublin City Council approved USI’s request to display a large graphic banner from the headquarters of the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU) at Liberty Hall. Advertising the national protest march and intended to evoke public support, it duly hung for over a week. 

Speaking to <em>The University Times</em> last month, USI President Laura Harmon expressed her hopes that "thousands" of students will attend the protest.The event marks the organisation’s return to its traditional single-location mass protest event, having in recent years organised co-ordinated regional "days of action". 

In 2013, fewer than 100 students attended a Molesworth Street rally on a wretched October afternoon. Events in Cork and Sligo, however, attracted a combined total of around 6,000 students. 

USI’s recent efforts to encourage solidarity among unions have borne fruit for this campaign, with SIPTU, Irish Federation of University Teachers, Teachers' Union of Ireland, ICTU Youth, Young Workers Network, We're Not Leaving, Communication Workers Union, Communication Workers Youth Committee, Defend the University, Irish Second Level Students' Union, Conradh na Gaeilge, and NUS-USI among the organisations to express their support for the rally. 

Speaking to <em>The University Times</em>, Harmon emphasised the ‘positive’ approach to the campaign and the increased level of support from similar organisations:

"The pre-budget campaign this year is more positive in its approach than previous years and focuses on the value of education to society and the contributions that students make."

She went on to say: "However, it has a strong central message that student supports need to be protected, in particular the maintenance grant and the Back to Education Allowance. SUs will be lobbying public representatives in the run-up to the Budget on our pre-submission, which also includes asks around student accommodation."

		<title>66-year-old Man Charged with Damaging Front Gate</title>
		<link>http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=29349</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Edmund Heaphy</strong> | <em>Deputy Editor</em>

A 66-year-old man has been charged with damaging Front Gate this evening. He is accused of causing €43,816 worth of damages to the historic gate, which was erected in the early 1870s, after ramming it with his car in early April.

John Farrell, who resides at Fassaugh Avenue in Cabra, appeared before Judge James Faughnan at a late sitting of Dublin District Court this evening. He has been granted bail, pending a November court date in the Circuit Court.

Aside from the charge specifically relating to the damage of the gate, he faces twenty other charges in relation to the dangerous driving incident, including allegations of endangerment of life, hit-and-run and a further €18,000 in criminal damage to the grounds of Trinity and nearby streets.

Garda Anthony Brazil, from Pearse Street Garda Station, told the court that Farrell was charged earlier this afternoon.

It is understood that the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed for a trial on indictment, which means that the case will be tried in the Circuit Court rather than in the District Court. This allows for tougher sentencing. 

It is reported that Mr Farrell did not address the court during the hearing this evening, and that he has not indicated how he intends to plead in the case when it arises again.

The incident in question occurred at the early hours on the morning of April 2nd. Farrell was released without charge within 24 hours of his initial arrest.

Following the damage, the surviving sections of Front Gate were taken away for repair work by craftsmen Messrs Dunwoody & Dobson. The gate was restored in early June.

The gate, which historically has been referred to as the Great Gates in College documents, has distinctive high-fielded diamond-shaped panelling, which added significant complexity to the restoration process.

Farrell is due to appear in court again on November 26th.

		<title>TCD and UCD Slip In Higher Education Rankings</title>
		<link>http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=29358</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Kayle Crosson |</strong><em> Senior Staff Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Both Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin have both fallen in global university rankings, according to a report released this week by Times Higher Education. TCD has fallen a further nine places down the list to 138th for the 2014/2015 rankings, as it was previously ranked at 129th for the 2013/2014 academic year. UCD has slipped substantially in the Times Higher Education rankings, falling from a previous 161st place to the 226th to the 250th bracket.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These declines have been observed to represent a “tipping point” for the future direction of Irish higher education, according to Tom Boland, the chief executive of the Higher Education Authority. Mr. Boland further elaborated on the consequences of this slip in rankings for Ireland’s competitiveness in university education on a global playing field, “The global university rankings, for all their flaws, reflect international perceptions and we should take note of concerns that our universities are not in a position to compete”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trinity College Dublin has seen a notable decline in its Times Higher Education ranking, falling from 43rd internationally in 2009 to 76th the following year in 2010. University College Dublin’s recent rankings in the past years has been noted to be a sharper decline, falling from 89th in 2009 to 161st last year. UCD president, Professor Andrew Deeks, described the results as being “puzzling”, in relation to the QS world ranking that was released last month which had UCD maintaining a 139th place.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the news was not all negative regarding Irish universities, as Galway jumped forward to the 3rd best university in Ireland, passing out University College Cork to the 251st-275th bracket. UCC remained unchanged in its ranking of 276th – 300th, whilst Royal College of Surgeons Ireland entered the top 400 at the 351st – 400th bracket.</p>
<p dir="ltr">These rankings for the 2014/2015 academic year have renewed calls to substantial budgetary cuts to higher education, however, according to some academics, this would severely damage Irish universities’ chances of jumping to higher international rankings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trinity’s decline has today been attributed to a lack of funding in comparison to other top 200 universities, as Dean of Research Vinny Cahill has highlighted, making it difficult for Trinity to compete on a global level: “Our universities are sliding because we can’t compete on funding. On a per academic basis, Trinity’s annual budget is 45 percent lower than that of the average top 200 university”.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>I Have A Tribe</strong>

Friday
10:00-10:30
The Button Factory

Patrick O’Laoghaire’s captivating and intriguing sound is one sure to make for a change in direction in today’s Irish folk-pop scene, and after spending months touring with Anna Calvi and Villagers, as well as working on a debut EP with Rob Ellis (PJ Harvey, Anna Calvi) and Conor O’ Brien (Villagers), I Have A Tribe is one act that would be a travesty not to catch in an intimate atmosphere while you can.

<strong>Jetsetter</strong>

Saturday
9:20-9:50
Bad Bob’s

Playing smooth Beach Rock that recalls the music of Real Estate, The Byrds and The Strokes, Jetsetter are, quite simply, one of the most refreshingly original bands knocking about Dublin at the moment. A must see.

<strong>Cloud Castle Lake</strong>

Saturday
10:00-10:30
The Button Factory

Playing eclectic and ethereal jazzy alt-rock, Cloud Castle Lake are a band that are not to be missed, featuring a male falsetto vocal that leaves the listener mesmerised when they think they’ve heard it all from this now almost clichéd approach in Pop music.

<strong>Meltybrains?</strong>

Saturday
10:40-11:10
The Workman’s Club

Little can be said of exactly what it is that Meltybrains? does. Words are often insufficient in attempting to describe their music. Put simply, in a world in which pastiche after pastiche appears every year, Meltybrains? is a band unlike any other, providing a live show that is set to enthral and astound the audience.

<strong>Spies </strong>

Saturday
11:20-11:50
Bad Bob’s

Having only just been on the road with an Ireland and UK mini-tour, as well as enjoying a great deal of widespread critical acclaim for their latest single ‘Moosehead’, this already well-established Dublin-based Indie Rock quintet are an act not to be missed, and bound to end the weekend on an energising and memorable note.

		<title>Heads of Student Bodies Call for Action on Education</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Catherine Healy, Samuel Riggs &amp; Domhnall McGlacken Byrne |</strong> <em>Editor of Trinity News, Editor of The University Times &amp; TCDSU President</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Too often, students restrict ourselves to opposing specific decisions. Too rarely are we given the opportunity to alter the perspective from which decisions are made.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recent decisions denote a way of thinking that has gone unchecked in the higher education sector. University and governmental decision-makers alike have felt the need to make choices that run counter to our core beliefs: that our educational institutions exist for their students, and that our higher education sector should be accessible, student-centric and responsibly governed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among others, our grievances are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">- Trinity rightly exalts its societies and clubs on an international stage. However, these same bodies of Trinity and many other institutions have found their finances cut repeatedly in recent years, despite the priceless contribution they make.</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Pastoral and academic services alike have become critically starved of governmental resources, directly hindering students’ fulfilment of their potential as graduates and as people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Longstanding inactivity has culminated in an unsustainable accommodation crisis. There remains an alarming lack of any long-term strategy to deal with the issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Cuts to student supports and services are mirrored across the country. Overall state funding of third-level institutions in Ireland has fallen by 32% in the past six years, according to the Higher Education Authority (HEA). Academic staff are increasingly overworked as the national staff-student ratio increases. For a new cohort of first-year students, education is more expensive than ever. Successive grant cuts, high rental costs and hikes in the student contribution charge have squeezed unprecedented numbers out of the system.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We stand at a crucial point in the history of Irish higher education. Together we call on our fellow students to show that education is worth fighting for and to let our voices be heard. Let’s join together on Wednesday 8th October as we Rally for Education, alongside other students from across the island.</p>
There is a saying that, in times of famine, the one thing we must not eat is our seeds. In years to come Irish society will depend on our higher education sector to deliver not only tax-payers, but the innovators, thinkers and researchers who will drive the recovery we need. We urge Trinity and governmental leaders to recognise that it is now that these seeds must be sown.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Aisling Curtis | Senior Staff Writer
<p dir="ltr">There's something irresistible about a beautiful Instagram filter, transforming a drab frozen moment into a shining one, allowing you the luxury of appearing to live in luxury, even if you don't. On Erasmus in Paris, I'm disgustingly guilty of this: a rainbow of stacked macaroons, the Eiffel tower, the Seine drenched in golden light and the silhouette of Notre Dame. There's a lure to editing your life until it looks a little better; a lure that social media has exponentially fed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More times than I can count, I've found myself living the wild life: halfway through the contents of my fridge, doing nothing except aimlessly scrolling Facebook in the hopes that something - anything - will shed a fragment of intrigue on my night. And it's then that you come across the photos. The beautifully shaded picture of somebody's incredibly healthy dinner. The light, bright summer pictures, everybody having so much fun. Those on Erasmus, J1s, high-profile internships. The debris of lives that somehow manage to be a hundred times better than yours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It's bad enough that the media already bombards us with reminder upon reminder of our own inadequacy: now we do it to each other, too. In a survey conducted by disability charity Scope, researchers found that a third of Facebook users felt lonely after seeing the supposed high levels of connectivity of their peers. And almost half admitted that the sites made them feel unattractive. 62% also acknowledged feeling inadequate about their own achievements, and 60% admitted to jealousy of others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This “fear of missing out” (FOMO) is another problem that we can add to our generation's woefully long list: the exquisite anxiety that accompanies feelings that everyone's having a better time than you, has more friends than you, is more successful or attractive or social than you. Its even been studied scientifically by Andrew Przybylski, a psychologist at the University of Essex in England, who created a ten-item questionnaire that quantified this psychological anxiety (a version of which can be found online at ratemyfomo.com). Those high in FOMO were found to feel less independent and less competent, and were significantly more likely to utilise social media to a high degree. Though the researchers couldn't fully determine if FOMO drives social media use, or if social media use creates FOMO, they did agree that social media was detrimental to those already high in psychological uncertainty and that “fear of missing out”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s impossible to deny the upsides of all this connection: the ability to keep in contact with far-off friends, to share exciting moments and receive healthy gratification, to feel connected with those who aren’t with you or who you haven’t seen for a while. These types of updates shouldn’t be demonised; they’re good for us, in an age where everybody’s constantly on the move.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And, of course, FOMO isn’t a new phenomenon. It has been around forever, transmitted via letters and postcards and email before social media appeared. The difference now is that it can be hard to switch off. Now, we can check Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat and the myriad of other contact hubs every second of every day, gratified - or not - in a moment, the constant scrolling excitement of others’ lives, accessible whenever we wish.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It may not be a bad thing. Social media is regularly derogated, but the truth is it’s too soon for us to really see the effects for what they are, to decisively state that they are good, bad, or - more likely - somewhere in between.</p>
Saying that, I couldn’t count the number of times I’ve habitually checked my phone while writing this. And the four days where I couldn’t access the Internet after moving abroad led to dire acts like stealing McDonald’s free wifi and buying Starbucks just so I could reorient myself in my virtual life.  Maybe all of this connection is not such a bad thing; it’s got its good points, but the truth is we probably all need to switch off every now and again.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Students Vote in Favour of €120 Sports Centre Charge in Preferendum</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Samuel Riggs</strong>, <strong>Jack Leahy</strong> and <strong>Edmund Heaphy</strong>

Students have voted narrowly for the Sports Centre charge to increase to €120 in the preferendum held alongside class rep elections. The €120 option will now proceed to a referendum to be held alongside sabbatical officer elections in February.

With a lead of just 78 votes on the second most popular option, €90, students have opted to support the decision of the Sports Centre to raise its charges by €30.

A total of 1918 students voted in the preferendum. During the count, the option to pay €160 was eliminated on the first count, gaining only 142 votes, with votes being redistributed on the second count resulting in the €120 win. The €90 option received 853 votes, whilst €120 received 931 votes.

This preferendum came as a result of a motion passed by the Students’ Union Council in March, which mandated a preferendum on the Sports Centre charge, as well as the follow-up referendum to be held in February, when students will be offered the opportunity to formally vote for the union to lobby the college for the charge to increase to €120.

In 2007, students assented to a compulsory annual Sports Centre subscription of €70, with any rises linked to inflation only. The charge has increased in burst over the last number of years and reached €90 in September 2014, a €13 increase on 2013.

A potential increase to the charge was proposed at the November 2013 meeting of the college's Capitations Committee, but was withdrawn upon reflection and permission for the increase was sought elsewhere.

The Sports Centre had warned before the vote that if the charge was to remain at €90, students could face a 'peak-time' charge for visits between 4pm and 9pm.

In an information leaflet released this week, TCDSU suggested that an increase to €120 per student would be necessary to maintain or improve current service levels. A €160 charge, it was suggested, would offer the potential for improved sports facilities in the centre, development of a rifle range, improvements to the facilities at Islandbridge and at the Santry Sports Grounds.

Students currently account for 80 per cent of the Sports Centre's membership and 72 per cent of gym usage. Other members include staff and external members.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Paying €120 for an Over crowded , understocked  gym. The Floor in the gym is an absolute joke , but is only half as hilarious as the Band system put in place to try and curb busy weights room . Rather than solve the problem they make Paying members Wait do be allowed into the weights area. With over 16 thousand students , all paying the mandatory Sports membership charge the mind boggles as to how the price has to increase , how the facilities are so consistently bad and why there hasn't been a bigger deal made of it  ... 16 thousand * 120 = almost 2 million euros.. wheres the money going?!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Don't know if you've compared that 120 euro charge to the cost of other gyms? If you did you'd see that a 160 euro fee is the only way to increase the quality of the facilities in the college, not just for the gym but for all the sports clubs. This would lead to far better quality of sporting facilities, and would mean the use of the gym is not split between all the sports clubs. Sadly people were unable to see the bigger picture, and instead chose to save themselves €40, a fairly insubstantial figure in comparison to the registration fees it accompanies ]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Flyfit in Macken Street is 284 euro a year , for a 20,000 square foot training facility , which is fantastically equipped and open 24/7 . I Highly doubt they have 16,000 Members.

Even if the gym wasnt used by other sports clubs it would still be ridiculously small in compared to other universities and for what is needed by Students.

The fact that the rugby club and the GAA clubs share what precious equipment there is in the mornings is a complete farce. They are a large well funded club and should have facilities of their own , not only is it intimidating to have a huge group of rugby players swanning around the weights room in the mornings , they also take up allot of space and have half the equipment reserved to them , how is this fair?

In the past 5 years I've been a member of the TCD gym the weights are has not increased in size by a considerable amount , the stretching area has been reduced , and some of the equipment taken away and replaced with worse equipment , the big cable machine with pull up bars replaced with a tiny little one and  a whole room dedicated to Keiser equipment which is rarely used

The rubber matting floor is still a shambles  , The barbells and Plates are damaged , When the weights are is populated with 3 or 4 "strong guys" the plates are completely used up and the GHD machine has been wobbly and broken for the best part of 2 years despite my numerous complaints.



I'm only highlighting the issues with the weights room as thats what i use the most , but there are issues with the changing rooms , the lockers systems , the swimming pool changing area aswell. The whole sports centre is a farce and needs a complete overhaul.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[The Sports Department was very upfront about what the money from these increases will go toward.120 euro is going to be enough to expand the Fitness Centre (i.e. weights, cardio, etc.). The reason such facilities haven't expanded recently is that the charge was stuck at 77 euro for a number of years. 

The extra money coming from 160 was not going to be used to further expand the Sports Centre. Rather it was to go toward things like squash courts, rifle ranges, and boat houses that 90% of Trinity students have absolutely no reason to be paying for.

120 was absolutely the right option. Honestly I was pleasantly surprised students didn't go for 90.]]></wp:comment_content>

It's always an exciting thing when a new band appears on the scene, especially when that band's debut album has the capacity to lull such a large audience into adoration with no knowledge of what has gone before. But when that band announces a follow-up, one can't help but wonder, how will it compare to such a monumental introduction?
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; line-height: 178%; text-align: left; width: 42%; color: black; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;">
<p style="font-size: 160%;"></p>
how will it compare to such a monumental introduction?</blockquote>
Following the booming success of their 2012 debut album, <i>Shallow Bed</i>, Dry The River faced the challenge of writing and releasing a follow-up record without the room or privacy to figure out whether or not they had found their own idiosyncratic musical lexicon in the midst of the imitation every band begins with (and many never leave), as well as producing something that was, if not of superior quality, at least on a par with and exhibiting some sort of development from the previous record. It came as no surprise then that when the band released a short making-of documentary about their sophomore album, <i>Alarms In The Heart</i>, one of the first things mentioned by lead singer Peter Liddle was that, when writing songs for the new record, he "was really trying to force a level of complexity into the songs to show myself that two years of touring had improved me as a musician."
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; line-height: 178%; text-align: left; width: 42%; color: black; float: left; padding: 16px 22px 32px 0px; margin: 5px 20px 0px 0px;">
<p style="font-size: 160%;">
the record still retains a vibe that fans will recognise as the Dry The River’s trademark sound</blockquote>
Fortunately, while being less acoustically driven and relying less on four-part harmonies to make for the more sense-seizing moments of the album (a tactic whose novelty and charm has been near done to death by the likes of Mumford), the record still retains a vibe that fans will recognise as the Dry The River’s trademark sound, with experimentation in areas of key/tonality/time signature changes to make for a more innovative sound than that of <i>Shallow Bed</i>. However, for all that might be said for progression from their debut, dynamically, the record still manages to strip itself back to some of the more vulnerable and winsome sounds of <i>Shallow Bed</i> from time to time, complimented by the almost Antony and the Johnsons style of frailty in Liddle's counter-tenor vocal.
<blockquote style="font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; line-height: 178%; text-align: left; width: 42%; color: black; float: right; padding: 0px 0px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;">
<p style="font-size: 160%;"> </p>a subtle but significant maturation from the band's debut</blockquote>
Overall, complete with a production team of the likes of Charlie Hugall (Florence + The Machine) and Paul Savage (Mogwai), as well as working with Valgeir Sigurosson (Sigur Rós, Björk) to make for some of the more lavishly ambient string arrangements, the record exhibits a subtle but significant maturation from the band's debut, and is bound to act a treat to both previous fans and curious folk looking for an introduction.

<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Phil Presents the Bram Stoker Club in association with DU Music: "Shostakovich: Composer, Supporter or Dissident", a paper by Helen McCormack</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Hilary Hogan | </strong><em>Contributing Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">He is known in Russia for his operatic work, chamber music, jazz suites, and above all, his symphonies. A controversial figure in the Soviet Union, he had a tumultuous relationship with the government. Despite allegedly weaving anti establishment messages throughout his work, his music continued to receive acclaim throughout the USSR, and he was honoured frequently during his lifetime by the Soviets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ultimately, despite a number of political controversies, (include a scathing review of his work in the Pravda¸ rumoured to have been penned by Stalin himself) his work came to symbolise an era in Soviet Russia; so much so that his was the first piece of music to be played when the Soviets succeeded in sending a satellite to space, and his music came to symbolise the patriotic efforts of the Russian people during World War II.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cosy, casual atmosphere of the Bram is the perfect place to curl up and enjoy listening to a talk on a fascinating figure. Although the paper itself argues that Shosatovich was a dissident underneath a façade of loyalty to the Soviet government, his life is such a mystifying mix of seemingly contradictory events that it is impossible to definitively decide. Ultimately, this is one mystery that will never be satisfactorily solved, so the audience is left with a tantalising brain teaser to ponder.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The event does suffer somewhat from a lack of focused exposure to the topic in question – our interest is piqued in Shostakovich, but poor acoustics make it difficult for the audience to hear a recording of his music. Normally, this is precisely what sets the Bram apart from any other talk or lecture - it does not conform to the rigid formality that we have come to expect from other college events. However, given that Shosatokovich’s music is the focal point of the presentation, an accompanying soundtrack would have pulled everything together, given that the event was in conjuncture with DU Music Society. That aside, the detailed analysis of Shostakovich’s intriguing life was nothing if not impressive, and it bodes well for the year ahead. Up next, a cyborg.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Anne Enright visits DU Players (01/10/14)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sheila Naughton |</strong><em> Contributing Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">As the apparently unassuming Anne Enright entered the DU Players’ Theatre on Tuesday the 30th September 2014, the immediate atmosphere was one of familiarity and comfort. Her blue converse, and the placing of her feet onto her chair indicated she was at home, and of course she was. As a past student of Trinity College and a Players member, she spent a lot of time in that room.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The interview, by Chris Morash, Professor of English in Trinity, began with a brief discussion on Enright’s schooling days. Speaking about her career in RTE, Enright was open and honest about the difficulties she encountered. Having completed a Masters in Creative Writing she produced a show called ‘Nighthawks’. Although many of the audience were too young to have ever seen ‘Nighthawks’, it was amusing to hear of RTE’s frustration at its lack of control over the production. However, for Enright the 1990’s brought about unwanted change in the industry and, in her own words, she ‘fell apart’, and left RTE.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following this breakdown, her first novel was published in 1995 – ‘The Wig My Father Wore’.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Enright revealed that she feels some of her best writing is done when coming out of or going into a state of depression. When asked if it became easier to write as you became more experienced, Enright remarked the technicalities become more familiar and that she developed the ability to cut something that was not right for the story even if it hurt.  Enright was complimentary of the new writers that have emerged since the recession, commenting that it was a good thing for Irish writing because more people had less to do, so they wrote. She does not believe that awards mean you are a good writer; they don’t make the next book any easier or automatically brilliant and she still has to think, ’Fuck, what do I do now?’</p>
<p dir="ltr">The interview was relaxed and enjoyable and she spoke with honesty, warmth and humour. She is an inspiring woman, especially to us Arts students, giving hope that there are jobs out there. One quote that will stick with me as a Drama student is, she decided to study English because ‘I wanted to be useless in the most specific way.’ So, I think I will adopt this as my new mantra.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The Zoo Soc Bat Walk (02/10/14)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Amy Corkery | </strong><em>Contributing Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">We entered the park through Castleknock Gate and the committee lead us to a large patch of trees near Farmleigh House to begin searching for bats! We gathered into small groups with a member of Committee each having a bat detector. They taught us how to use the dectectors – we had to set it to specific frequencies to detect different breeds of bat. There were 3 breeds that we had to look out for: Leisler, Daubenton and Pipstrelle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We then started to use the bat detectors; when the bats came close, the bat detectors started beeping so we knew they were near. Sooner than anyone anticipated, there were bats flying around us! There were a few swooping close to our heads and everyone was very excited, with a buzz of delight coming from the whole group. We then changed the frequency to see if we could pick up the sound of any Pipstrelles, as we were told that they did live in the park but it was very rare to see them. It turned out we were very lucky, as soon after we switched the frequency setting, it started to beep!</p>
<p dir="ltr">We stayed by the trees for some time, watching the bats flying around us and chatting. It was very dark by this stage and we could only see the bats when they were silhouetted against the night sky, which was a really beautiful sight. The bats were much smaller than I had expected them to be, but that just made them even cuter!</p>
<p dir="ltr">While we were watching the bats, we noticed a herd of deer running through the park beyond the trees. Unfortunately it was too dark to get a good photo, but it was magnificent and a lovely surprise.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Suddenly, it was time to head home. We had been there for much longer than it seemed. You know the saying: Time flies when you’re having fun! Thanks to Zoo Soc for all their work, and making it a great excursion to the park.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paul Behan</strong> | <em>Societies Editor</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Next week The Bram Stoker Club have cyborg artist Neil Harbisson popping in on Tuesday at half two, DU Music are hosting an open Open Mic Night on Wednesday at eight, Players have an Auditions Workshop with Nicholas Johnson (the drama school’s resident dashing dreamboat) on Friday at ten and I’m sure Zoo Soc will have something wild in the works.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tune in next week as we slowly get more comfortable in leveling arbitrary / unconstructive criticism on the hard work of others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">P</p>

		<title>Young Fine Gael Release Pre-Budget Submission</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Paul Glynn |</strong> <em>Senior Staff Writer</em>

Young Fine Gael (YFG) have released a pre-budget submission for the 2015 national budget, entitled “Hope for our Generation”. The ten-page submission outlines eighteen key recommendations for the upcoming budget, including plans aimed at supporting and protecting students in terms of finance, mental health and youth unemployment.

The safeguarding of students’ rights is YFG’s seventh key recommendation, outlined under the title “Protecting Students”. The organisation has suggested freezing the annual student contribution charge at €2,750. The charge is set to rise to €3,000 if current propositions for the 2015 budget follow through. Instead, YFG proposes the introduction of a Graduate Tax. “By breaking down the financial barrier to education that is currently in place and instead allowing students who have benefitted from third level education to make a contribution later on in life”, states the report, “we believe this is the fairest and most equitable way of securing the future prospects for education in our country”.

YFG also affirms its support for the protection of the student grant. Citing the exponential increase in rental rates in Ireland’s cities, YFG states that: “we should not erect more barriers to third level education in Ireland”, and that: “the Government at this crucial point needs to ensure every student gets the support they need to successfully complete third level education”. The report adds that: “It is YFG’s firm view that education is a right, not a privilege”.

The submission also contains a detailed recommendation on tackling the issue of youth unemployment. Proposals include the creation of the new role of Minister of State for Youth Unemployment and Enterprise Affairs, mandatory work placement for third-level students, a greater emphasis on multilingualism and language education, implement a mandatory Leaving Certificate or Leaving Certificate Applied before leaving post-primary education, and offering tax incentives to companies hiring young people in long-term unemployment. This section of the submission also recommends the development of “a comprehensive system in place for young people out of work based on best practice to help tailor plans that best suit the young person”. The recommendation on youth unemployment follows up on a report issued by YFG earlier in June entitled “Exiting the Crisis, Preparing for the Future”.

Mental Health services are also targeted in the submission: “Ireland deserves a 21st century community based person-focused mental health service, based on the principles of recovery”, states the report, adding that people “can and do recover from mental illness”. YFG cites the neglect of Ireland’s mental health system, stating that only €20 million out of a promised €35 million has been allocated by the current government to such services. The submission also cites claims that 200,000 children and adolescents suffer from mental health problems. According to the report, “Men and young people in general are at the highest risk of suicide and self-harm and community based services should be available to ensure that they can access services locally and ensure that they start on the road to recovery”.

Other proposals in the submission include the removal of one- and two-cent coins from circulation, the increasing of the price of a pack of 20 cigarettes by 60 cents, and the introduction of redeemable recycling levies on glass bottles, cans and plastic containers.

		<title>A Madness To The Method</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Daniel O’Brien | Opinions Editor
<p dir="ltr">Nothing draws more disproportionate hype this time of year relative to student interest than the release of global university rankings. Admittedly, students enjoy seeing the results, but their attention rarely lingers beyond cheeky messages to a friend at UCD. The most recent release has seen the Times Higher Education (THE) rankings drop Trinity nine places to 138th, and should leave many wondering what that number actually means.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The short answer is nothing, on it’s own. Absent any context, that number is a like a sticker price for an object you’ve never seen or heard of before. The tag might say 10 quid, but is that a bargain, or was it made for pennies?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The proper context for university rankings is their methodology. I’m going to focus on THE rankings here, because they are the most recent and the most unfavourable to Trinity, but the logic is often similar in other tables. For THE, the five major categories are International Outlook, Research, Citations, Industry Income, and Teaching. Looking closely at these scores tells the story of why a university’s ranking changed, and more importantly whether its students should care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">University rankings are valuable, but only if you are interested in the exact things that they measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Trinity scores very highly on International Outlook (which must’ve put a spring in Paddy Prendergast’s step). This number uses domestic-to-international ratios for students and staff, on the assumption that more diversity means taking the best of both groups from around the world. I hesitate to make any specific claims to the contrary, but that assumption would seem to require further investigation. At the very least, it is easy to argue that diversity is intrinsically valuable to students by expanding their cultural exposure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Next is Research, as in the volume and reputation thereof, as well as the income it generates. Here Trinity suffers primarily from its ties to the Irish government, whose recent cuts to the education budget have been both necessary and painful. Undergraduate students, though, should notice that declining research output and income is really only meaningful to those pursuing advanced degrees, especially since it’s not the result of a decline in underlying educational value. This is the first of the three scores that are useful almost exclusively to academics, and therefore undermine the credibility of a single overall ranking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Trinity’s relative success in Citations points to the sustained quality of its staff. Even with shrinking budgets, the university’s published work is cited by other scholars at an extraordinary rate. That Trinity scores so well in the highest weighted criterion says plenty about overblown fears of the university’s decline. Again, however, this metric is really only valuable within the academic sphere, unless you want to argue that academic citations correlate with quality of undergraduate education. Students would likely counter that a brilliant researcher often lacks the charisma or ingenuity to thrive in the classroom.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Looking closely at these scores tells the story of why a university’s ranking changed, and more importantly whether its students should care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Industry Income is a lightly weighted and somewhat unimportant score, in which Trinity still manages to do poorly. Essentially this rates how the commercial marketplace values a university’s research and innovations, in monetary terms. This is the third score that assumes a positive relationship between postgraduate research and overall educational value. By now this assumption should be at least questionable enough for us to wonder why it underpins three-fifths of the overall ranking.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The final category is Teaching. I’ve saved it for last because it is the most relevant score for the greatest number of students, but also the trickiest to quantify. The score comprises a number of correlative measures, like ratios of students-to-staff and doctoral-to-bachelor’s degrees awarded. But the most highly weighted factor is the result of an academic reputation survey given to a select group of academics.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, the survey completely ignores a school’s reputation among companies that might actually hire its graduates. That’s how THE’s reputation rankings place Pennsylvania State University at 39th (go Nittany Lions!), while Ivy League bastion Brown University checks in at 81st. I’m betting even non-Americans can guess which of those schools produces higher-earning graduates.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">These issues, and so many more, are not captured by meaningless rankings, or even the complex metrics that determine them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">If you’ve gotten somewhat lost in the numbers by now, you’re starting to see what little relevance these metrics hold in the day-to-day experience of students. They overly emphasize things that are important for students looking to remain in academia, which is to say not many of them. This wouldn’t be too problematic if not for the fact that all of the College’s recent decisions seem aimed at driving up the ranking, regardless of it’s tenuous connection to improving student life or job prospects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, students can’t find accommodation because Trinity has deemed building new dorms unimportant, and the Sports Centre has to curb overcrowding by further squeezing those who don’t even use it. These issues, and so many more, are not captured by meaningless rankings, or even the complex metrics that determine them. Instead they are felt only by the students who will one day have to explain to a potential employer why their school isn’t ranked as highly as the last guy’s.</p>
<p dir="ltr">University rankings are valuable, but only if you are interested in the exact things that they measure. For most students, comparing graduate earnings or employment rates would be a far more helpful way to evaluate schools. And that’s assuming you can objectively rank different educations in the first place. The media and society far too often extrapolate a single ranking to make a point that the numbers do not support. Understanding the data behind the headline is the first step in determining its value, or lack thereof.</p>

		<title>Students Question Provost on Privatisation, Cuts and Accommodation Crisis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jack Leahy</strong> and <strong>Edmund Heaphy</strong>

Speaking at a Q&A session facilitated by the University Philosophical Society and Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union, Provost Patrick Prendergast has insisted that it is "not [his] purpose in being Provost to ensure Trinity is privatised”. The Provost also confirmed that the College is assessing off-campus properties for renovation for student accommodation purposes. 

Prendergast also used the session – his first such occasion since October 2011 – to answer questions from students on accommodation, strategic planning, funding cuts to student organisations, and third-level funding. 

TCDSU President, Domhnall McGlacken-Byrne, moderated the session, which was introduced by Phil President, Sarah Mortell, and contextualised by TCDSU Communications Officer, Samuel Riggs, who also serves as editor of <em>The University Times</em>. Riggs’s introduction was pointed, summarising a number of the unfulfilled promises made by the Provost in his 2011 election manifesto. 

A crowd of around 100 turned up to hear the Provost engage in the first event of its kind since the early days of his tenure in 2011. If that event, with the same hosts, felt scripted and practiced, the 2014 installment felt more informal in character as the Provost spoke without notes and there was no requirement to submit questions in advance. 

McGlacken-Byrne opened by citing accommodation shortages in Dublin City, raising the notion that accommodation was effectively a student service. This prompted an exchange in which the Provost accepted that College had “a degree of responsibility” for providing accommodation and affirmed that “there’s something special about being in rooms.”

Responding to criticisms of the College’s planning with regards to student numbers, Prendergast said that finding the correct site and developers for potential new builds was proving “difficult”, but that he hopes to have overseen the build of 2,000 new rooms within five years. Windmill Lane and Spencer Dock were cited as potential sites. 

This is the first occasion on which the Provost has spoken of Dublin’s escalating accommodation crisis. Dean of Students, Kevin O’Kelly, confirmed in September that plans are in place to renovate Oisín House of Pearse Street into a building with 300 student rooms by 2018. As an interim relief measure, Prendergast told TCDSU Welfare Officer Ian Mooney that the College will support the SU in assisting struggling students. 

When asked to clarify reports that he was considering turning Trinity into a private university, the Provost claimed to be unaware of the reports but insisted that there were no plans for such a drastic changes. 

"We can consider everything from complete privatisation to complete nationalisation. The truth is, Trinity College is somewhere in the middle. It's a publicly funded organisation, a public university of course, and quite rightly, I'm proud to be a public university, operating in the public good – both privately and publicly funded.

“At the Trinity Global Graduates Forum, we mused over the idea of privatisation as part of a debate topic. But that's not the way universities are organised in Europe."

"It's not my purpose in being Provost to ensure Trinity is privatised."

The Provost said he was working on a number of options for increasing the College’s non-exchequer funding, "whilst not letting the government off the hook”. He seemed to suggest that he would support an increase in private contribution to tuition:

"I started out from the position of not wanting fees. But I think we have to look at what's happening: around the world, public funding of higher education is reducing and what individuals are expected to pay up front is increasing. And we would wonder what the Irish government's policy is going to be with regard to this.”

“The Minister for Education has set up a funding group to look at it and will be reporting by the end of 2015, which in my opinion is far too late. There will be an interim report before the end of the year, so we'll get some sort of idea then of the direction of the government."

Asked by McGlacken-Byrne whether or not this represented the government “kicking the can down the road”, and if this would be harmful, Prendergast responded that he was concerned that the delay might lead to the debate on third-level funding “being lost” in discussions before the next General Election. 

It had been anticipated that the Provost would come under fire as a result of a 5 per cent cut to student organisations, and the only surprise was that it took until the second hour for the topic to arise. He indicated regret that the decisions had been made “without proper student consultation” but insisted that the “sacrosanct” protection from cuts that these organisations had enjoyed was “unsustainable”. 

When asked if he believed that the College was exploiting students through zero-hour contracts and free labour from postgraduate students, the Provost claimed to be unaware of any such activity. He did, however, endorse the controversial JobBridge scheme, expressing that it was his duty ‘as one of the largest employers in Dublin’ to embrace the spirit of ‘offering an opportunity’ to young people. 


The Provost was in combative form, frequently interjecting to correct misunderstandings and inaccuracies in questions. He told one journalist from <em>Trinity News</em> that she could use “a lesson in College history” to correct a misunderstanding in relation to funding for a Student Centre allocated in the the last strategic plan. Plans for a Student Centre were voted down by students in February 2011.

In relation to the proposed introduction of levies last May, which were widely protested by students, Prendergast said:

"In our determination to ensure that we're still providing services, the money has to come from somewhere. That's the bottom line. Now I do agree that these charges were a bit ham-fistedly done and I wasn't happy with that myself."

<p dir="ltr">Professor Shane O’Mara, a Trinity Professor of Experimental Brain Research, is to receive €1.2 million of funding in order to study the systems that support memory in the brain.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Professor O’Mara becomes the first Irish-based recipient of a Senior Investigator Award. The award is a joint funding initiative between the Health Research Board, the Wellcome Trust Biomedical Partnership and Science Foundation Ireland. It aims to support top researchers that already hold a recognised academic position and research important questions in the areas of into health and disease.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He aims to greater understand brain systems by exploring the effects of brain damage on memory loss and how interactions within the brain support memory.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Professor O’Mara, who is a Principal Investigator in, and currently the Director of, the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, will be working in partnership with Professor John Aggleton of Cardiff University after they jointly received the Senior Investigator Award. They will receive the funding over a six-year period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Speaking to The University Times, O’Mara explained how: “My research focuses on understanding the orchestration of the differing brain areas that are involved in consolidating memories in the brain. Simply put, here memories are the events of your life that you can recall and say out loud ('declarative' or 'explicit' memories).</p>
<p dir="ltr">“These can be simple - 'what did I have for breakfast?' or 'where did I put my keys?' or 'where I am going out to tonight?'. We know some of the brain areas that support these kinds of memories, and knowing these will give us a chance to understand how they function in health, and how they might go wrong in diseases such as dementia.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He continued: “I am delighted to have been selected for this Senior Investigator Award, but feel it is as much a testimony to many gifted PhD students and Postdoctoral Fellows I have been privileged to work with here at Trinity and further afield over the past years. I hope that through our work we will be able to reveal some of the principles underpinning memory processing by the brain, and as a result, be able to assist in some way toward the quest to help restore functioning to those some suffering from memory problems.”</p>

		<title>It&#039;s A Chaplains Life</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Sarah Galvin</strong> | Contributing Writer

‘You’re the journalist! You’re the one that’s going to make me famous!’ he jokes, casually propping his shoeless feet on the desk in his office, the four walls of which are smothered in rugby pin-ups and posters. ‘I wouldn’t say journalist’, I insist, and he is surprisingly no less enthused by the knowledge that his up-and-coming fame is in the shaky hands of an amateur at best. The initial pang of panic I feel quickly subsides as Julian ‘Jools’ Hamilton, the Methodist chaplain here in Trinity College, invites me to take a seat and it is then, and only then, that I begin to understand just one of the many reasons why students choose to come here.

The Chaplaincy at Trinity College may at first seem an unlikely place to spend your free time, yet, it is a sanctuary for a vast number of Trinity students. Despite it’s stony exterior, House 27 is a comfortable environment that offers students a place to de-stress, socialize and discuss any issues they may have with one of the four chaplains, each of whom represent one of the four main denominations of the Christian Church. Students may simply ‘pop in’ for a chat and within seconds of meeting Jools Hamilton, it’s easy to understand why. The Queens University graduate’s appearance does not match my expected view of a college chaplain. The loop piercing his left ear invites one to draw an all too obvious comparison to Irish actor Colin Farrell, and it is one which I briefly consider as the Methodist chaplain tries to provide me with a better understanding of the role of the Chaplaincy inside the college gates.
<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>The loop piercing his left ear invites a comparison to Irish actor Colin Farrell
</span></blockquote> 

With four representatives of the Christian faith working both separately and collectively within the walls of the Chapel and House 27 in order to promote a deeper understanding of the Christian faith and spirituality, one might be of the mistaken belief that it is an exclusive organisation, however, it is not by any means confined to those who profess Christianity. It is instead described by Jools as a ‘welcoming and free social space’ where participation is encouraged and invitations extended to those of any or no religious affiliation. This view is echoed by students like Alex Crean, who sees the the Chaplaincy as more of ‘a social space’ where he can go on a regular basis with his friends to take time out and a place where there is no sense of exclusivity.  

The organization of various activities and trips throughout the year allows students the opportunity to socialize, reflect and learn. Only last year, a group of students were afforded the chance to visit Israel and Palestine at a time when Israeli-Palestinian tensions were rising. This time around, a cultural immersion trip to India is on the cards during which the students will live with Muslim students and discover their way of living. These are just some of the larger scale activities organized by the Chaplaincy and help to reveal the Trinity campus and the Chaplaincy’s willingness and desire to engage with people of all faiths. 

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>students like Alex Crean see the the Chaplaincy as more of ‘a social space’ 
</span></blockquote> 

On a smaller scale, there are daily ecumenical services, Anglican book groups, lunch on Tuesdays and annual events such as God on Tap – an event in the sacred Pavilion bar where a guest speaker is invited to offer their opinions on a thought-provoking topic before students can then ‘grab a pint’ and ask questions. Though the different chaplains organize activities independently of one another, the chaplaincy is ultimately an ecumenical one and there is a certain emphasis placed on a ‘core’ identity whereby each denomination comes together and is seen as one. It is this core identity that organizes ecumenical events such as the planned visit to Ireland from Israeli and Palestinian students this year for a week of discussion on conflict transformation.

<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Jools insists that the Chaplaincy is not ‘a counselling service’
</span></blockquote> 

In the overall college structure the Chaplaincy is a student service with the chairperson of the organization taking his seat at weekly meetings of the Student Services Forum. Students have the freedom to meet with any four of the chaplains in a more private setting where they can seek guidance and advice on issues, stresses or struggles they may be dealing with stemming from college life or other sources. And whilst Jools insists that the Chaplaincy is not ‘a counselling service’ and it does not ‘pretend to be’, there is a somewhat unofficial process in place whereby students who have a mental health issue, may be referred by the Chaplains to the better qualified, college counselling service. The process works both ways and is important in providing a strong system of support for those who may be suffering with mental health problems. 

The Chaplaincy ultimately aims to provide for both ends of the spectrum, the days being very much a balance of social events and more serious encounters which often result in days that can only be described as ‘gut-wrenching’. It is latter aspect of his job (though he views it more as a lifestyle when you exclude the phone calls, paperwork and emails) that Julian finds the most difficult yet it is one of the many reasons why he loves what he does, vowing that the best aspect of his ‘lifestyle’ is that no two days are the same. The Chaplaincy is a relaxing environment that aspires to be at the heart of college life, striving to assist students in any way it can throughout their time in Trinity.

		<title>Trinity Purchases Largest Collection of Beckett Letters</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Kayle Crossan</strong> | <em>Staff Writer</em>

Trinity College Dublin has purchased the largest collection of letters of one of its most noted alumni, Samuel Beckett, ever to have been offered for public sale. This sale has now officially established Trinity as the holder of the largest collection of Beckett letters of any research library throughout Europe and the world.

The collection of 347 letters and cards were sent from Samuel Beckett to artists Henri and Josette Hayden, a couple whom Beckett and his wife, Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil, met during their time southern France evading discovery by Nazi forces during the Second World War.

The letters date from as early as 1947 and cover the difficulties Beckett faced during the aftermath of the passing of his mother and brother. The letters also cover Beckett’s most creative period of his writing career, which would eventually lead to a Nobel Prize, when he was completing Waiting for Godot. At the time of these correspondences he was also working on all three books of his trilogy Molloy, Malone dies, and The Unnameable.

Trinity College Dublin has now become the epicentre for any sort of literary research regarding Samuel Beckett, with other correspondences to the poet Thomas MacGreevy and literary critic Barbara Bray. The MacGreevy collection is notably quite personal, while in contrast his correspondences to Barbara Bray were more centred on his work.

The recently acquired Hayden collection will now act as link for these two collections by overlapping chronologically and also by being a blend of both Beckett’s personal and literary concerns and opinions.

Trinity was able to make this notable purchase thanks to the generosity of a former staff member, William O’Sullivan, Keeper of Manuscripts in Trinity from the 1950s to 1982. Mr. O’Sullivan had left a bequest to the Library which made this acquisition possible, which mirrored the same type of consideration Samuel Beckett displayed towards Trinity College after his time spent there as a student.

Examples of his generosity include presenting some of his literary manuscripts to Trinity’s Library in the 1960s, awarding some of his Nobel Prize money to the Library, and also by giving a year’s worth of profits from the Broadway production of <em>Krapp’s Last Tape</em> to the Berkeley Library’s building fund in the 1950s.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Anonymous</strong> | <em>Contributing Writer</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Editor's Note: This piece originally appeared in its full, unedited form as an open letter at increature.com, and has been sent by the authors to a number of relevant government authorities. With their permission, it has been edited here for length and format.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">--</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are two final year university students who live in Dublin and wish to express our profound discontent with some of the situations in which we found ourselves during our search for housing in the Irish capital, and particularly the clear discrimination against students which is common practice in the rental market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Between June and September, we were actively looking for private accommodation in Dublin. We sent several hundreds of emails, made hundreds of phone calls, went to numerous viewings and spent a lot of time, money and energy looking for a place. The house hunt was a very stressful experience which resulted in us sacrificing a large part of our summer, spare time after work, family time and the possibility to advance with college work (readings, dissertation, etc.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">We finally found a place two weeks before the start of the academic year, a place that we are not entirely satisfied with, but had to take for lack of other offers. We are somewhat relieved that we were lucky enough to  find something, as we are very aware that many students were not as lucky and are therefore forced to commute, live in hostels or even take a year out of college.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Many students were not as lucky and are therefore forced to commute, live in hostels or even take a year out of college.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">One of us is a final year Student in the faculty of arts and humanities who worked the whole summer in a well-respected office in Dublin and will continue to work part-time throughout the academic year. The other is a final year Political Science and Geography student who works during the summer months and is financially supported by her father who works in one of the European Institutions in Brussels. Both of us have letters of references from all our previous landlords stating we are responsible tenants, that the rent and all utility bills have always been paid on time and that we left our previous flats in good condition. Furthermore, we both have good work references from well-respected institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Having such documents, one must wonder how it took us three months to find a mediocre residence.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To us, the answer is very simple. The housing crisis meant that it was hard for everyone to find a place in Dublin due to the fact that this year there was a 43% drop in supply in the rental market and a 7.5% increase in rental prices. But students, in particular, have a clear disadvantage and are discriminated against.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">We knew the definition of the word “discrimination,” but during our house hunt we learned what it means to be discriminated against.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Many housing ads online clearly state “no students” or “young professionals only.” Many times, when we called or sent an email asking for a viewing, the agent or the advertiser simply explained to us that we had no chance to be considered because we were students and we were simply wasting our time trying. Many times, we were told that the landlord or landlady would just not accept any students. Many times, the agent or advertiser was simply rude or condescending.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We do understand that the real estate agencies were under tremendous pressure, as they had to deal with this huge demand for housing. But it does not in anyway justify being rude and universally excluding students.  It is extremely frustrating when the whole day, phone call after phone call, you are being rejected just because your current occupation is “student”. We knew the definition of the word “discrimination,” but during our house hunt we learned what it means to be discriminated against.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Equal Status Act of 2000 promotes equality and prohibits certain forms of discrimination. It also applies to lettings. In an article that is part of a Ten Step Law series written by Roddy Tyrrell, a Board Member of the Property Registration Authority it clearly says that:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>''When you are satisfied with your prospective tenant’s ability to pay their rent it is time to interview them. Be careful with the questions you ask as equality law prohibits you from refusing to offer accommodation or from terminating a tenancy on any of the following nine grounds: gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race, membership of the traveller community. You should base your decisions on the merits of the prospective tenants.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">In our experience, our  requests for accommodation or viewings were often declined before we even had the chance to prove our ability to pay rent. All this, on the grounds that we are students. We strongly believe that this is unfair.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Students who have, in the past, rented accommodation and can provide good references should be treated the same as everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">It is true that the Equal Status Act of 2000 does not state that discrimination on the bases that someone being a student is illegal. However, we believe that being a student is, in the majority of cases, closely related to age. The Equal Status Act states that “<em>Treating a person who has not attained the age of 18 years less favourably or more favourably than another, whatever that other person's age, shall not be regarded as discrimination on the age ground.</em>”</p>
<p dir="ltr">This means that all people over the age of 18 should be equally treated. They should not be put at a disadvantage because they are “younger” than young professionals who are also looking for accommodation. Having guarantors and working part-time and during the summers, we believe that we are as able as ‘young professionals’ to pay rent and all the utility bills and that we should not be discriminated just because we are slightly younger and because we are studying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tenants should be chosen based on their merits and references - and if discriminated against, discriminated against based on their actions, not their occupation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Universities should be more active in assisting students in their housing hunt and the government should work to ensure equality of treatment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, in our experience some landlords were offering a place on the condition that we pay double the deposit, just because we are students. We understand that some landlords have had bad experiences when renting to students. It is true that some young adults are inconsiderate of the premises they are renting: causing damage, disturbing the neighbours or being unreliable. However, this is clearly not the case with all students, and  landlords can have bad experiences with all sorts of different people. Once again: students who have, in the past, rented accommodation and can provide good references should be treated the same as everyone else.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a serious need for regulation in the rental market. Universities should be more active in assisting students in their housing hunt and the government should work to ensure equality of treatment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are openly complaining because we believe that it is utterly unfair that we expect to pay the same amount for the same places as anyone else, and yet we are being openly discriminated against and are forced to either pay an outrageous amount for rent or take the worst places.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We demand more students accommodation, and we demand a stop to the open discrimination that students face in the rental market.</p>

		<title>Thousands of students set for City Centre march</title>

Between 3,000 and 5,000 students are expected to take part in the Union of Students in Ireland’s protest march tomorrow ahead of next week’s budget announcements.

Students will march from the Garden of Remembrance, through the streets of Dublin to a rally outside the houses of the Oireachtas. The rally is the latest action in USI’s campaign to protect student supports and have education recognised as a public good.

Members of the Irish Second-Level Students Union, the Defend the University campaign, and the Services Industrial Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU) will address those gathered at Molesworth Street having pledged their support for the USI’s ‘Education is’ campaign.

Dublin acoustic hip-hop act Original Rude Boys announced on their Twitter page last week that they are to perform at the rally outside of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Rap artist Temper-Mental MissElanyous was confirmed in September.

Despite Minister for Education and Skills Jan O’Sullivan last week <a href="http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=29227" target="_blank">announcing that she hopes to protect student maintenance grant levels in this budget</a>, student representatives are not counting any chickens. Should anticipations come to fruition, this event will represented the largest single mobilisation of Irish students for three years.

Students’ Unions from across the republic have organised buses to transport students to and from the event, while students from Queen’s University Belfast and the University of Ulster are also expected to attend. Northern Ireland’s student leader, NUS-USI President Rebecca Hall, this morning spoke to endorse the event, stating that she was delighted to stand “shoulder to shoulder with [her] USI colleagues” in doing so.

Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union officers have been delivering hourly lecture addresses with members of the USI officer board in an effort to boost attendance from Trinity students. Society chairpersons, sports club captains, students’ union officers, and student newspaper editors released a statement on Friday calling on students to attend the event and challenge the ‘perspective from which decisions are made’

In something of a setback to their hopes, Senior Lecturer Dr. Gillian Martin emailed the student body this morning to warn that students should check with their respective departments before missing labs, tutorials, and seminars.

Undergraduate students had been granted permission to miss class for the 2010 ‘Education not Emigration’ march through the City Centre.

USI President Harmon said:

“Education is Ireland’s hope for a better future – so we’re prepared to work hard to promote the value of it. Students, college staff and trade unions want to work together with other civil society organisations to highlight the central role college can have in the future development of Irish society.

“College is too expensive for many, with the second highest fees in Europe. Meanwhile, the student maintenance grant helps thousands who otherwise could simply not afford to enter third level education. It was protected for the first time in five years in Budget 2014 and needs to be protected again now.

“Thousands of students will be arriving from across the island to tell public representatives and the Government that education is valuable, is worth investing in and must be treated as a public good in this budget and beyond.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jack Leahy |</strong> <em>News Editor</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Trinity College’s director of communications and marketing is due to leave his position, the College has confirmed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bernard Mallee, a former journalist and special advisor to the government, was best known in College for having spearheaded the controversial Trinity Identity Initiative. He assumed this responsibility at the direction of the Provost as part of his brief to improve the College’s internal and external communications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mr Mallee had been under pressure in his position after <em>The Irish Times</em> and <em>The University Times</em> broke details of proposals to radically alter the College logotype and formally adopt ‘Trinity College, The University of Dublin’ as its name.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That pressure came to a head towards the end of the academic year in a number of spheres. In April, a town hall consultation session went sour when a number of fellows and students attacked the project and proposed that it be scrapped.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A student-run Facebook page – ‘Proposed Logos for TCD’ – went viral with its images mocking the proposed designs for the new logotype. The University Times also understands that the level of expenditure involved in the project was negatively received when a request for further funding was brought to the College Finance Committee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He will move on to provide counsel on policy and communications in the Middle East.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A College spokesperson confirmed that Mr Mallee has resigned his position, effective from the end of this month, to return to his career in the commercial sector.</p>
<strong>Correction: <em>20:05, October 7, 2014</em></strong>
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Bernard Mallee has left his position. He currently remains in his position and is expected to depart in the near future.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Team Europe: At It Again In The Ryder Cup</title>
		<link>http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=29563</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lee Eustace |</strong> <em>Contributing Editor</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">A week on from team Europe’s latest Ryder cup victory against team USA, amid a wave of expert analysis and against a series of contrasting post-mortems, the question remains as to what is Europe’s secret recipe for success? The latest victory at Gleneagles marked Europe’s third consecutive triumph and indeed their eighth victory from the previous ten encounters, spanning all the way back to 1995.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the surface, it appears as if there is little to separate the two teams – as the official world rankings suggest, with team USA commanding an average ranking position of 16th in comparison to Europe’s 18th. In spite of this seemingly equal playing-field, team USA once again struggled to match the passion and commitment shown by their European counterparts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This recurring motif of European solidarity is particularly unusual given that the latest European team comprised of nine different nationalities, stretching from the four-corners of Great Britain to the heart of Scandinavia and back towards the Mediterranean coast. Team USA meanwhile, are ostensibly united under the one flag, The Star-Spangled Banner, which was so prominently displayed on their jumpers during Saturday’s proceedings. Unfortunately the knitwear better withstood the test of a bitter Scottish, Saturday afternoon than the American players.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was during such a time that team Europe gained the upper-hand. The format of the Ryder Cup lends itself to four team sessions, with a grand total of sixteen points available in comparison to Sunday’s singles format which offers twelve points. In truth, Sunday’s twelve points, although evenly contested, were little more than a victory march for Europe who ran out 16.5 – 11.5 victors. Early victories for Irishmen McDowell and McIlroy and the German, Martin Kaymer, seemingly secured the trophy before Welsh rookie, Jamie Donaldson, played the winning shot midway through Sunday’s proceedings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On reflection, the vital points were gained during Friday and Saturday’s foursome sessions, from which team Europe emerged with a staggering seven from a possible eight points. The imbalance in foursome matches was duly recognised by US Captain, Tom Watson, who moments after the winning shot, congratulated his counterpart McGinley with a wry smile as he joked, ‘we may have had a match if it weren’t for the foursomes!’. Watson, far from campaigning to change the format of the competition, was right to point towards his team’s deficiencies in such team formats of the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From high-fives to fist-bumps, and from battle cries to whispers of encouragement, team Europe oozed collective confidence and determination. United both on the golf course and in the press room, Europe’s winning team spoke of nothing but the collective goal. Team USA glaringly failed to adopt such an attitude, as shown by Phil Mickelson’s controversial comments in both pre and post tournament press conferences.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mickelson, the senior-statesman of this US team, was quick to implicate team Europe, and in particular stalwarts McIlroy and McDowell, during his untimely ‘ligate’ accusations. Aligned to these inappropriate comments was his post-tournament assessment, in which he openly criticised team captain Watson. The fallout from such comments are well-documented as the US search for the winning mentality which was last seen during Paul Azinger’s captainship during the 2008 campaign at Valhalla.</p>
Mickelson’s comments, although untimely, highlight the unrest beneath the surface of the US camp, as players and journalists alike wade into the on-going debate. Meanwhile, members of the European camp are surely in the process of framing the winning pictures from Sunday afternoon, and perhaps even a few celebratory photos from Sunday night, which have since emerged on social media.

Reports have also emerged that Irishman Darren Clarke is a front runner for the 2016 captaincy, a role which is of confirmed interest to him. Rumours on the other side of the Atlantic are somewhat less publicised, as the potential candidates seem understandably reluctant to enter such a volatile cauldron at present. Europe has no such problems, as players and supporters alike look forward to defending the crown on US soil in two years’ time.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Summer with An Iranian Activist</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Neil Barrett</strong>|Contributing Writer	
	
My friend Daire and I travelled to the Caucasus region and Iran this Summer, and had the very interesting experience of staying with an Iranian opposition activist through Couchsurfing (a social media site that hooks people up with a free place to stay). As a sort of clarification to begin this piece, I should state that Iranian people are easily the friendliest and most hospitable I have ever encountered – we got offers of free accommodation on the streets on an at least daily basis, for example. They are also acutely aware of their country’s negative image in Western media, which by extension also slurs the individual people of the country. I would hate to add to this unfairly negative portrayal of the Persian people.

Our host, who I’m going to call Ali (we thought it better not to reveal his real name on the off chance that the Revolutionary Guard read keep tabs on Irish student newspapers), met us just after dawn near his apartment. We’d caught a late-night, 9 hour bus from the northern city of Tabriz and after some fruitless early morning searching we were grateful that he was so obliging.

<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>He was sentenced to 165 lashes
</span></blockquote>

Ali was of medium height and had a slim build. He was approaching his thirtieth birthday, and despite some grey flecks, appeared several years younger. There were four sleeping bodies to greet us in Ali’s small but well-kept apartment – a German, an Indian and two very stereotypical Danes. Couchsurfing is illegal in Iran, and as an ‘offender’ Ali was obviously at the more serious end of the scale.

But based on what he would tell us over the course of the next five days, Couchsurfing was potentially the least of his worries. Ali had had several run-ins with the law already, and on one occasion with some nasty results. Aged just 19, he had been driving his car with a non-relative single girl sitting in the passenger seat, only to be flagged by a random Morality Police road check. To compound matters, there was a bottle of vodka sitting in the back seat. Mercifully, it was unopened.

<div class="lepen"><img alt="" src="http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IMG_0954.jpg" /></div>

Eventually, he was charged for inappropriate interaction with an unmarried girl and for possession of alcohol. He was sentenced to 165 lashes, and his companion 15. There is no court of appeals in the Islamic Republic. He is left with horrific scars on his back, and still feels pain there from time to time. If he had actually consumed alcohol, it would have been even worse. While he and other Iranians stressed that Ali had been unlucky in getting a particularly strict judge (most people get away with similar ‘crimes’ by paying “heavy fines” in lieu of the flogging), it was nonetheless shocking to see that such barbarism could be carried out in a country full of such friendly people.

This early traumatic experience hardened his determination to oppose the regime. Ali’s mandatory military service period of 21 months coincided with the 2009 Iranian presidential elections. The ‘Green Movement’ of protestors capitalised upon their opportunity to agitate for change and thousands of people across the country joined peaceful street protests, calling for increased democratisation and a more liberal interpretation of Sharia Law. To his horror, Ali found himself ordered to baton charge those whose ideals he shared, those whom he considered friends, and those whom he would otherwise have joined on the streets. He eventually received official punishment from the military for disobeying orders. Ali had refused to attack the marchers, and continually tried to edge towards the back of his group of soldiers.

During this period, Ali joined others in the explosion of expression in Iran, and used his video editing and multimedia skills to anonymously publish content critical of Iran’s military and religious leaders online. Much to our benefit, he also joined Couchsurfing. He was arrested and released three times in 2009, but none of the accusations stuck. He just laughed and explained that because the police arrested so many people before and after the 2009 elections in a fit of paranoia and intimidation tactics, they also knew that logically many of those arrested were innocent. Thus, unless they had conclusive proof against you, if you could withstand an interrogation and maintain your denials, they would probably let you go. So it transpired. Don’t know if I could be so blasé about it.

Ultimately, the ‘Green Movement’ succeeded in forcing some concessions from the conservative rulers. Since 2009, the sight of dating couples has become more common, especially in Tehran. Hijabs are slipping further and further back on the head. Women’s forearms are exposed more regularly. The atmosphere is less tense. The police are relaxing Islamic behavioural and dress code standards to a limited degree in an attempt to appease the youth. However, several hundred deaths were reported during the protests, amidst thousands of arrests. The leaders remain under house arrest to this day. The movement was violently suppressed.

<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>The goals of the Green Movement remain unfulfilled 
</span></blockquote>


The candidate they backed, Hossein Mousavi (who Ali claimed was merely the lesser of two evils, and who was a conservative leader in the late 1980’s), is widely believed to have won the 2009 election against the incumbent, hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. However, the latter was preferred by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei (who holds all the real power in Iran), and widespread electoral fraud ensured that he got his man. When I asked how the current president, Hassan Rouhani, a moderate, was ‘allowed’ to win the 2014 elections, Ali explained that this was another concession from the regime to appease the youth. Ultimately, Rouhani is a better ‘public face’ to both Iranian liberals and the wider world than Ahmadinejad, but he remains entirely under the thumb of Khamenei. To Ali, this is little more than a PR exercise, and the goals of the Green Movement remain unfulfilled.

Ali continues to host Couchsurfers in great numbers, and also to publish content critical of the government online. He insists that he is not senior enough in activist circles for the government to invest much in investigating him (a couple of his friends have been arrested, though), and that he is careful in what he does. He is an incredibly brave man, and very pleasant and good-humoured with it, despite the stress he must feel.

My feeling (and you can almost sense it walking on the streets) is that the dissatisfied Iranian youth are taking the country on an inexorable path towards reform, but it may take a while. Certainly, we should all appreciate the freedoms we have in Ireland, which so many around the world put themselves at risk to achieve.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Jack Leahy</strong> | <em>News Editor</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">An estimated 6,000 students, activists and trade union members have attended a rally calling for the protection of student supports and the recognition of education as a public good.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An official headcount from Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union (TCDSU) pegged the Trinity delegation at around 250 people, making it the largest student delegation. Students were rallied in Front Square by TCDSU President, Domhnall McGlacken-Byrne, and his predecessor of 25 years Senator Ivana Bacik, before joining other protesters at the Garden of Remembrance on Parnell Street.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The union this morning purchased 500 rain ponchos to offset last-minute withdrawals due to downpours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Following an initial delay, the march proceeded without incident to Molesworth Street via O’Connell Street, College Green, and Nassau Street. The TCDSU delegation, energised by Afro-Carribean Society drummers, kept the attendant crowds entertained.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The march culminated with a rally across the road from Leinster House, at which students’ union leaders and trade union activists called for the recognition of education as a social good.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rally was opened by Dublin rapper Temper-Mental MissElayneous, who thanked the crowd for its energy and lamented a “lack of resources” repelling young people from education.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ronnie Munck of the ‘Defend the University’ charter told students that “whatever problems [they] may have with lecturers harassing [them] for essays, we are on your side”, while Ethel Buckley of SIPTU declared that “education as a public good is worth fighting for”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Craig McHugh, president of the Irish Second-Level Students’ Union (ISSU), spoke of his members’ anxiety over their future. In an address that proved a crowd-pleaser, he said that “students deserve the right to have something to work for” at second level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">USI President Laura Harmon concluded the rally, asserting that “we gather and campaign and argue because education matters” and pledging to ask Minister for Education and Skills Jan O’Sullivan to “play her part in making sure that education is central to our recovering”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Acoustic hip-hop group Original Rude Boys then concluded the rally with five songs.</p>
Speaking outside of the rally, Gardaí told <em>The University Times</em> that while they had not attempted a count, 6,000 protesters would represent ‘a good guess’.

<strong>Correction: <em>23:50, October 8, 2014</em></strong>
An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of the "Defend the University" representative who spoke at the rally. He is Ronnie Munck, not Munk.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Laura Hegarty | Contributing Writer</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><em>‘Pro-life’ or ‘pro-choice’. ‘Pro-Palestine’ or ‘pro-Israel’. ‘Feminist’ or ‘Absolutely Not a Feminist’.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Why are these decisions that we are seemingly forced to make today? None of these oversimplified labels could ever reflect my true personal opinion. No issue is ever so black and white that public opinion can be divided and polarised in such a manner. In the same way that referenda are an inadequate means of ascertaining the true view of the people, such labels come from a vocabulary capable only of depicting the most extreme and/or simple of views.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Having an absolute and unqualified view is often a sign that one does not fully understand the issue at hand</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">For example, the ‘I am not a feminist because…’ movement was based on the premise of women (for the most part) publicly saying that they were not feminists for a variety of reasons. Why is it a matter of being a feminist or being against feminists? Why did they feel the need to socially and intellectually limit themselves in such a way? These people are doing themselves a disservice. This is a toxic attitude to have considering that the majority of women would be, to different degrees, in support of certain beliefs of both the ‘feminist’ and ‘anti-feminist’ groups.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Emma Watson’s now-famous HeForShe speech to members of the UN has drawn a lot of attention and has been rightfully praised for the points she made in it. One part that particularly struck me was when she said “It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum, instead of two sets of opposing ideals. If we stop defining each other by what we are not, and start defining ourselves by who we are, we can all be freer…” This idea of a ‘spectrum’ is something that we should incorporate into other areas, along with that of gender identity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There will always be a spectrum when it comes to having an opinion, especially on a controversial topic. When does one ever express oneself in a heated debate without using caveat words such as ‘but’ or ‘except’ or ‘although’? These are the admissions and exceptions that make the debate heated, the words that make an opinion nuanced. Having an absolute and unqualified view is often a sign that one does not fully understand the issue at hand. Thus labelling our opinions in such a manner cheapens them – they lose their unique elements and they lose the quirks and insights that make them ours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Why then do we try and place people in these unrealistic opposing camps?</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Such labels come from a vocabulary capable only of depicting the most extreme and/or simple of views.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Perhaps it could be seen as a mechanism for attempting to better understand what is going on around us. In a world that has become one large ‘grey area’, making the big issues appear black and white makes them more easily processed. Perhaps it stems from our need, as millennials, to slot people easily into one box or another. Maybe in a transparent world of status updates and public posts, having a complicated opinion personal to you is just too much for some to deal with.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Or does this approach simply make it easier to argue against the view of our intellectual opponents? The first of Schopenhauer’s thirty-eight stratagems to win an argument from ‘The Art of Controversy’, is as follows, ‘carry your opponent’s argument beyond its natural limits; exaggerate it. The more general your opponent’s statement becomes, the more objections you can find with it. The more restricted or narrow his or her propositions remain, the easier they are to defend by him or her.’ Labelling someone as ‘pro-choice’ and throwing at them the most heinous or extremist examples of views held by certain people at this end of the spectrum makes arguing opposing ideas much less difficult. In this way, one must only confront the general and overarching issues associated with particular groups, rather than tackling the intricacies of that particular person’s argument.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One thing is for sure – slapping a simplistic label on an opinion sucks out the intelligence and individuality. Anyone with an opinion worth listening to will need more than two hyphenated words to express it.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

<strong>Sinéad Baker, Dónal Ring &amp; Kayle Crossan</strong>
<blockquote>“The government needs to consider how it focuses on education in the upcoming budget, and how the cuts to education will influence the quality of our education”.</blockquote>
– Stephen McLoughlin, 2nd year Geography and Politics
<blockquote>“The fact that we’re here in the rain shows we’re really committed”</blockquote>
– Megan Leahy, 2nd Year History and Politics
<blockquote>"Funding for Trinity is absolutely crucial on a wide academic level, especially for Nanoscience as it is an area of science that is rapidly advancing and improving the quality and accuracy of research, and we simply cannot allow for that progress to be slowed down”.</blockquote>
– Daniel Boland, 2nd year Nanoscience, Physics, and Chemistry of Advanced Materials
<blockquote>“Students in Ireland need funding to survive.The great poncho protest of 2014 will shake the foundations of education!”</blockquote>
–  Isabelle Duff, 2nd Year History
<blockquote>“Trinity has seen in the last month a decline in rankings in both QS world rankings and the Times Higher Education rankings, and it’s no surprise that this can be attributed to funding cuts. If we don’t have the sufficient funding for research, then it’s Trinity’s global image that will be damaged”</blockquote>
– Sinead Murray, 2nd Year History and Political Science
<blockquote>“I’m here today to ensure that the funds allocated to our education are not cut, because we need funding to maintain the infrastructure of our country.”</blockquote>
– Sophia Giannopoulou, 2nd year Business, Economics, and Social Sciences
<blockquote>“We are protesting for people who aren’t always in the room”</blockquote>
– Declan Higgins, President of NUIG Students' Union
<blockquote>“I did this in Washington, Boston, and Woodstock in the sixties. Student protests haven’t changed much, except the police used to interrupt a lot more. I’m so glad Irish students are doing this. It’s wonderful. People are so much freer these days – nobody used to question anything. My advice always is: read and listen to everything, but question everything too.”</blockquote>
– Kathleen Heeney, Irish-American onlooker/admirer
<blockquote>“We’re here today to support the Union of Students in Ireland’s protest because we believe strongly in protecting our education system. Obviously we have a lot of workers who work within the education sector, in terms of cleaners, lecturers, people who work in canteens and so on. So it’s very much in the interest of workers and students that our education system is protected.”

“Also it’s important not to see students and workers as separate groups, often students are forced into jobs to pay for bills, books, food etc. and they’re all regularly in precarious positions, they’re regularly on zero-hour contracts, and I think it’s brilliant that USI and the trade union movement are standing stronger together now."</blockquote>
– SIPTU representatives
<blockquote>“We welcome this demonstration. It’s very pleasing, and we’d like to congratulate USI on organising it. Investment in education is crucially important. Recent OECD figures indicate that public investment in education yields an internal rate of return of over 30%. We’re also very concerned about the workload placed on third-level lecturers.

“We represent lecturers in the IOTs and a number of other colleges, for issues arising around the number of hours that they’re expected to work, It’s not then possible for them to support students in the way they would like. The number of lecturers in the IOTs has fallen by almost 400 in the last few years, the number of students has risen by almost 11,500.”</blockquote>
– Teacher's Union of Ireland (TUI)
<blockquote>“Anseo inniú tá ceardchumainn muinteóirí, foireann ollscoile, mac léinn triú leibhéil, agus Conradh na Gaeilge. Táimid ag iarraidh gach éinne a tharraingt chun lúach an oideachais a leiriú”</blockquote>
– Feidhlim Seoige, Leas-Úachtaráin don Ghaeilge, Aontas na Mac Léinn
<blockquote>“We are here to represent working people who can’t send children to college without incurring huge debts. Education is an issue for all society”</blockquote>
– Steve Fitzpatrick, General Secretary of Communications Workers’ Union.
<blockquote>“Táimid in aghaidh ciorraithe ar chursaí Gaeilge, agus táimid ag iarradh breis rogha a thabhairt do mhic léinn”</blockquote>
– Conradh na Gaeilge

		<title>Taking Steps Towards Marriage Equality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Cormac Shine</strong> | <em>Editor-at-Large</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">One thing is certain about the expected referendum on equal marriage next spring: it will be won or lost by our generation. It’s a simple fact that those under 25 overwhelmingly support the introduction of equal marriage for gay and straight couples, but it’s also true that those under 25 are the least likely to vote. The Students’ Union has a very important and specific role to play in the wider campaign for equal marriage over the next few months: making sure Trinity students are registered to vote, and getting them to the polls.</p>
SU representatives conducted a straw poll throughout Freshers’ Week to gauge how many students are already registered to vote, and contrary to the very low figures one might expect, the results are actually somewhat heartening. Of all 800 students polled over a five day period, almost 65% are already registered to vote.
<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>The results are somewhat heartening – almost 65% are already registered to vote.

Of these, first years are the least likely to be registered, with only 51% registered to vote (keep in mind that this poll was conducted during Freshers’ Week when there are no classes – there may be a skew towards those more inclined to engage in community activity, and thus the figures may be slightly overstated). Figures were pretty constant across all disciplines, with the percentage of those registered to vote in AHSS, EMS, and health sciences ranging from 62% to 67%.
<p dir="ltr">What can be done to improve these figures, and to make sure they actually get to the polling booths? SU representatives have been visiting Halls in order to register freshers and guide them through this unnecessarily complex process, and this needs to continue until every student knows the basics of the process and has been given the opportunity to do so with minimal stress. In a community that has near-universal support for equal marriage, it’s imperative to get as many people on the register as possible, and the current figures simply aren’t good enough.</p>

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>There is an inherent challenge for a referendum seeking to change the status quo, and the challenge of facing a small but no doubt vocal opposition may bring the numbers down.</span></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">A poll conducted in February by RTE’s Prime Time and the Sunday Business Post points to 76% support for equal marriage, but it’s clear that there is an inherent challenge for a referendum seeking to change the status quo, and the challenge of facing a small but no doubt vocal opposition may bring these numbers down. The outlook is good now, but complacency is not something we can afford in a generation-defining poll that may not come around again soon. Remember, this is the country that legalized divorce in 1995 by 0.56% of the vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ireland has changed a lot in the last twenty years. For a country that only officially legalized homosexuality in 1993 thanks to the tireless campaigning of Senator David Norris and others, it’s clear LGBT* rights have improved a lot. But there’s still a long way to go, and on the other side of the coin it’s not too hard to see that many older generations might not vote Yes when it comes down to it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to make its contribution and live up to its mandated support for equal marriage and general support for LGBT* issues, the SU needs a focused and targeted plan to get people registered, walk them through the process and to get them to the polls when the date is announced.</p>

		<title>The Cost of Downsizing</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Barry Kearney</strong> | <em>Contributing Writer</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">It can safely be said that the honeymoon period for Ronny Deila is certainly over, as Celtic currently languish mid-table in the SPFL and recently became the only club in the history of the Champions League to be knocked out twice before the tournament even began. The fans have already asserted their discontent with the performances of the club, highlighting Deila's tactics and transfer policies as particularly undesirable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it has also been argued that the club's continued decline is down to the transfer strategy that has been enforced by the club's board. A policy that has seen Celtic's most successful players be sold onto other clubs for substantial fees, with only a fraction of that being reinvested in the club's first team squad. The result of this has been the downsizing of the Celtic team, to a point where the squad that lost to Hamilton Accies had 5 loanees and a free transfer.</p>

<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>The success that Celtic were achieving at home and abroad was coinciding with the decline of Rangers Football Club. Celtic's fiercest rivals had entered the liquidation process and re-emerged as a new company in the fourth tier of Scottish football.</span></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">To put into context the depth to which Celtic have downsized we will need to first look at the swift demise of the club's performance in Europe, perhaps the greatest and most ruthless test of a team's quality. The 2012/2013 season was the first journey into the Champions League for Celtic under the management of Neil Lennon. Celtic's first team had a particularly strong spine. In the heart of goals was Fraser Forster, protected by the central defensive partnership of Kelvin Wilson and Efe Ambrose, who provided a solid base for the midfield to build from.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The relationship between Scott Brown and Victor Wanyama contributed  a powerful core to the side, with Gary Hooper offering a clinical edge to the team in attack. These individuals would contribute to a side that would conquer the Catalan Giants; Barcelona and qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League for only the third time in Celtic's history.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The success that Celtic were achieving at home and abroad was coinciding with the decline of Rangers Football Club. Celtic's fiercest rivals had entered the liquidation process and re-emerged as a new company in the fourth tier of Scottish football. The departure of Rangers offered Celtic an opportunity to focus on European football, safe in the knowledge that the domestic league would take care of itself.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This domestic freedom would allow the Celtic board and manager to invest in a varied number of interests that could bring a strong financial basis allowing them to dominate Scottish football for long after Rangers' return to top flight football. However, on the evidence of the following two summer transfer windows, it would seem that the club is moving backwards, not forwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The summer of 2013 would see Celtic sell much of the spine of the their side that carried them through to the knockout stages of the Champions league. Gary Hooper was sold to Norwich city for a reported  £5.5M, his replacement would be Teemu Pukki for £2.6M. Victor Wanyama was sold to Southampton for £12.5, in his place was Nir Biton signed for £700,000. Virgil Van Djik was Celtic's most successful transaction of the summer, signed for £2.6M, filling the hole left behind by Kelvin Wilson who left for a similar price. Over the course of that season Celtic  made a net profit of £10.4M from transfers alone when all transactions are taken into account.</p>

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>This looks yet again to be another year of transition, not just for Celtic, but also for Ronny Deila. He comes across as a young manager, enthusiastically looking to implement long term goals. In the short term, however, fans want results.</span></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The results in Europe reflected this lack of investment; Celtic avoided an embarrassing early exit in the Champions League qualifying stages, overcoming a two goal deficit to Shakhter Karagandy, winning by three goals at Park Head. This was to be the last European win at home for almost 14 months. Celtic finished bottom of their group, losing 5 matches and suffering a debilitating 6-1 defeat at the hands of Barcelona. The club would finish the season as domestic champions, but would lose their manager within weeks of the season's end.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The summer of 2014 saw Celtic welcome the arrival of Ronny Deila as their new manager. Deila's first responsibility was to oversee the sale of the club's most prized asset, that of Fraser Forster, a World Cup International for England. Celtic would receive £10M from this transaction, the following few weeks would see the club go on to sign five players on loan. This was a continuation of the club's transfer policy from the 2013 season, the selling off of the clubs most valuable players, whilst replacing them with young, often out-of-favour rookies.</p>

<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>The Green brigade are a ruthless bunch, seemingly uninterested in balance for now. They're just not in the mood, baby. </span></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">This looks yet again to be another year of transition, not just for Celtic, but also for Ronny Deila. He comes across as a young manager, enthusiastically looking to implement long term goals.  In the short term, however, fans want results. The performances so far have been well below par, defeats to Legia Warsaw, Maribor, Inverness and most recently Hamilton has put Ronny Deila in a precarious position, however, it is unlikely that the sack looms. If Deila is sent packing after 6 months, it looks like Ronny's made too many mistakes. If Deila is sacked after 6 weeks it looks like the Celtic board's made a mistake in his appointment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With former Celtic stars like John Hartson publicly lambasting Deila as 'clueless', that eventuality of the sack teeters on the precipice of inevitability. Celtic could strike a happy balance with another season of domestic domination, whilst also putting in a respectable performance in the Europa League. However, the Green brigade are a ruthless bunch, seemingly uninterested in balance for now. They're just not in the mood, baby.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A New Class For A New Age</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Ciar McCormick |</strong> <em>Deputy Opinions Editor</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a growing class of people. They live a nomadic existence. They have temporary jobs and zero hour contracts. Their labour is transitory. They are doing an internship without a definite job at the end. These workers are suffering from the increased casualization of work. They find it difficult to build a career. They barely make a living wage from the work they do.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This class of people are growing in size but not influence. They are not a class, strictly in a Marxist sense, yet as they are divided, and can only be united in fears and insecurities. They do precarious work. They are the precariat.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The term precariat was first coined in the 1980’s in France to describe temporary and seasonal workers. The word is an amalgamation of precarious and proletariat. It can be defined as workers who exist without predictability and security. The precariat lacks all aspects of social security.</p>

<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>It is becoming more common that youths finishing third level education are forced into precarious work, either through unpaid internships or through low-security entry positions</span></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Guy Standing, an economist and professor of Development Studies at SOAS in the University of London, has written seriously about the topic of precarious work. His book The Precariat: The New Dangerous Class describes precarious workers as “an agglomerate of several different social groups, notably immigrants, young educated people, and those who have fallen out of the old-style industrial working class”. He provides greater analysis of their place in society by calling them by the name of “Denizens: people with restricted rights, largely living towards the bottom of a ‘tiered membership’ model of society.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The traditional working class is based around fixed workplaces and a working day. Precarious workers don’t have these luxuries, so they cannot reap the benefits that organised labour movements made in the twentieth century. There is no union for a temporary employee.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The precariat are a consequence of the neo-liberal economic model, a result of increasingly flexible labour markets due to globalisation. This flexibility has four elements: flexibility of wage means a race to the bottom in regard to wages in the labour market, flexibility of employment makes it easy for firms to change employees, job flexibility gives firms easy manoeuvrability to internally change an employee’s job within the company, and flexibility of skill makes it easy for firms to adjust workers’ skills through internal education. This flexibility only benefits companies. The flexibility of the labour market thrusts the transferring risks and insecurity of the labour market from companies to the workers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This precariat class is closer to home than you may think.  Precarious work is not only done by manual labourers but is becoming increasingly common in both blue and white collar workplaces. This new class of the precariat transcends the traditional class division of bourgeois and proletariat. It is becoming more common that youths finishing third level education are being forced into precarious work, either through unpaid internships or through low-security entry positions.</p>

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Precarious workers don’t have these luxuries, so they cannot reap the benefits that organised labour movements made in the twentieth century.</span></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">Academia is another new frontier for precarious work. 3rd Level Workplace Watch, a watchdog group, claims that teaching assistants, tutors, junior lecturers and researchers are all vulnerable to exploitation by universities in Ireland, such as our own Trinity College, due to the precarious element of the work provided. TLWW note that permanent jobs at University level are increasingly disappearing in favour of low-paid, temporary employment. Temporary work comes without security, proper remuneration or benefits, and renders invisible this labour that the university relies on to function. These precarious employees often teach core modules in departments or can be the essential members of research projects. There appears to be a paradox between the critical thinking and liberal egalitarian views that universities profess and the exploitation of postgraduate students who do a majority of the day-to-day work for a tiny income.</p>

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Precarious workers are growing a collective consciousness of common vulnerability. We can go one step further, by standing together against this precarious cliff, calling for a better future.</span></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">The development of this new class does have a silver lining though. It can re-invigorate the political left in a new way, forcing it to branch out from the old traditional unions. At the same time, it can draw on the roots of these labour movements to provide this new class of workers with the dignity they deserve. This will allow for a refreshed left that doesn’t yearn for a lost past but embraces the future, one that can fight for security beyond the workplace. Perhaps a basic citizen income? That’s what Guy Standing suggests. Every progressive movement is built on the anger, needs and aspirations of a major class. The left must embrace this emerging class of precarious workers to reassert itself on the political stage.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A progressive agenda has already been started by organisations such as the We’re Not Leaving movement, which has engaged with the idea of precarious work. There has also been commendable work done in the United States to set up the International Workers of the World or the Wobblies, who were “founded to organise the workers not the job.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Students and staff alike should recognise the dangerous future precarious work can bring, and should be self-aware of whether they have slipped into this class. The precariat are already beginning to mobilise, but solidarity involves collective action. Precarious workers are growing a collective consciousness of common vulnerability. We can go one step further, by standing together against this precarious cliff, calling for a better future.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Charlotte Ryan</strong> | <em>Deputy Features Editor</em>

I never got the “birds and the bees” talk. For me the metaphorical stork was no more than a semi-psychotic animal that dropped babies in through windows and the only thing I planned on finding in a cabbage patch was, well, cabbage. My parents favoured silence in educating me on sex. So, when on a parish-organised trip to Paris, their eight year old daughter having spotted her first sex shop asked for a condom for her Barbie their shock was justified. “At least Barbie’s being safe,” they said and I believe this was the first instance of sex positivity in my young life.

<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Sex positivity encourages people to embrace their sexuality on their own terms and without fear of judgement or shame
</span></blockquote>

The sex positive movement is relatively new in comparison to its mother movement, feminism, yet remarkable for its simplicity of purpose. With a focus on education, safety and consent at its core, sex positivity encourages people to embrace their sexuality on their own terms and without fear of judgement or shame. This does not mean that solely those who are sexually active can be sex positive; indeed there are a great many celibate sex positive people. Seeing sex and sexuality as a natural component of our humanity, the sex positivity movement considers sexuality an overwhelmingly healthy force, regardless of how that sexuality is interpreted. As sexologist and activist Carol Queen says, it is a “radical affirmation that we each grow our own passions on a different medium, that instead of having two or three or even half a dozen sexual orientations, we should be thinking in terms of millions.”

<div class="lepen"><img alt="" src="http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sexart2.jpg" /></div>

The progressive tenets of the movement would appear directly opposite the morally repressive and religion-centric sexual landscape of Ireland’s recent past. In a country that allowed the presumed moral compass of the society to sexually repress and shame its followers, sexual empowerment was taboo, particularly for women. Pressed into being non-sexual beings ideally preoccupied with creating a family and maintaining a virtuous demeanour, finding pleasure in sex was largely discouraged by the predominantly Catholic society. Sex was a wifely duty, not a gratifying pursuit and the Church was intent on dispelling any belief to the contrary with “religious laundries” set up to punish women for their sexual misdeeds. It wasn’t long before being confident in your sexuality became synonymous with licentiousness and ungodliness.

Under the all seeing eye of parish priests and prattling neighbours, access to information about sex and sexuality was almost non-existent. My mother recalls there being only two places for a woman to obtain reliable information about sex: the Well Woman Centre and the Irish Family Planning Association. While the Well Woman Centre focused on safer sex, the latter was steeped heavily in the influence of the Church, intent on endorsing the husband-wife-and-a-dozen-kids brand of Irish family. With the seminal sex guidebook, ‘The Joy of Sex’ by Alan Comfort banned in Ireland in 1974 any opportunity to view sex as a fun and satisfying pursuit was quashed. For the curious among them, the only way to turn was towards the sometimes insightful but mostly ridiculous Cosmopolitan sex columns. Once the Irish Family Planning Association got its hands on 25 precious copies of ‘The Joy of Sex’ those eager to see what they were missing cleared out the miniscule stock. Just after it was banned again.

While in some political and cultural debates we are firmly last in the race, taking into account the sexual repression our parents endured it is evident how progressive Ireland has become. “I’m constantly surprised at how sex positive Irish people are,” says Sarah Ryan, resident blogger at TheSexShop.ie. “There is still a stigma surrounding it, but people are starting to shrug it off, which is great.” The vast and varied assortment of sex manuals, adult boutiques and video blogs, in particular Laci Green’s long running Youtube series on sex positivity, have aided the pervasion of sex positivity in Ireland although there is a ways to go yet.

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>What preteen kid hasn’t blushed in embarrassed delight at the very mention of the Kama Sutra and the untold secrets of its opulent pages?
</span></blockquote> 

Despite Ireland having undergone a sort of sexual awakening in the last few decades there are cultures far more sophisticated in their appreciation of sex and sexuality, the shadows of which we have grown up in. What preteen kid hasn’t blushed in embarrassed delight at the very mention of the Kama Sutra and the untold secrets of its opulent pages? Even in youth one could discern the reverence it prescribed to sex, the ritual-like illustrations so far removed from the scenes that played out on flip phones smuggled into classes and leered over by pubescent boys. The relaxed attitude of the French to sex is bordering on cultural myth, with countless handbooks written on “How to Have Sex like a French Woman” flying off the shelves year after year. In Europe sex is such a comfortable presence they don’t even black out the windows of their sex shops.

Even with these enviable attitudes surrounding us, the most outdated facet of our sexual culture is the sense of judgement and shame towards a sexually confident woman that persists even through these permutations in society. The socially institutionalised lie that women are not inherently sexual haunts each new development on the path to equality of the sexes, as well as the sense of embarrassment for what is essentially a human impulse. While men as a whole have been free and even encouraged to boast about their sexual conquests for decades, the experiences of women were shushed by often disapproving peers.

Even today, a woman can be as sexually adventurous as she desires … provided she’s in a committed relationship. Engaging in as casual a sex life as many men do is still leads to more than a few raised eyebrows from men and women alike. Women aren’t supposed to like that, let alone pursue it! Given that women cannot always rely on the sexual guidance of other women, social cues from sexually positive women in the media have come to be relied upon.

<a href="http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sexart3.jpg"><img src="http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/sexart3.jpg" alt="sexart3" width="700" height="463" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-29688" /></a>

If our generation has a one-up on the previous ones it’s that despite our society being hyper sexualised we are lucky to have as many role models embodying sex positivity in their own ways. Popular culture is often dismissed as vulgar and distinct from highbrow intellectualism but the fact of the matter is that it has helped raise our generation like it has no other before and our lives are thus rooted in it.

It is for this reason that empowered women in media like Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj are so essential in promoting sex positivity. They present two vastly different takes on the movement. Beyoncé spent years crafting each individual persona – artist, businesswoman, wife, sexual being, mother, political activist, feminist icon – before honing them into a complete whole. She is wholesome and stable in her sexuality, an image most women can find themselves in. Minaj on the other hand played the male-dominated rap industry at its own game; instead of capitalising on her good looks and evident sexuality she bared her teeth and subverted what it meant to be a female rapper by singing about sex and power with as much confidence as her male peers. Both interpretations have come under fire and for the same reason: people confuse their manifest sexuality as sex.

When I see a sex shop I don’t see just sex; I see fun and enjoyment and vitality and this is what we should hope to see in the Ireland of the future. If sex positivity is to have one purpose in our society I would hope that it’s to strip away the residual shame inherited from previous generations and reorient sexuality as the most human and diverse of characteristics. If being able to happily embrace our sexuality takes a sexually aware Barbie doll or quoting Beyoncé as a personal mantra, so be it. 

<strong>Correction: <em>12.40, October 13, 2014</em></strong>
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Irish Family Planning Association had connections with the Catholic Church in Ireland only and did not provide the same level of advice on safer sex as the Well Woman Centre. The IFPA was established in 1969 in response to the State ban on contraception and has since then been a leading advocate for the advancement of sexual and reproductive health and rights in Ireland, including accurate, honest and evidence-based information on safer sex.

		<title>Humans of New York Goes Global</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Kayle Crosson</strong> | <em>Senior Staff Writer</em>

I, like many social media users, have fallen victim to the magnetism of Humans of New York (HONY), a blog that documents both the miracles and tragedies of the city's inhabitants. Tales of sorrow, loss, love and achievement are all conveyed through a photograph and a short interview, often prompted by questions such as: what advice would you give to a large group of people? What's your biggest regret? What was the happiest moment in your life? What was the saddest? 

This is what makes Humans of New York so unusually wonderful - you find yourself celebrating and empathizing with the tales of these strangers. Each story is like an instrument in a symphonic movement - each story told with uniquely captivating tones that blend together seamlessly to create an enthralling masterpiece. 
<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>The countries HONY photographer Brandon Stanton has visited are names that the media have equated with murder, disorder, and despair.
</span></blockquote>

Humans of New York then attempted a new angle of presenting the stories of strangers - by conveying the tales of struggle and triumph of people from all corners of the globe. More specifically, HONY  travelled in partnership with the United Nations to raise awareness for the Millennial Development Goals. The countries HONY photographer Brandon Stanton has visited are names that the media have equated with murder, disorder, and despair. Unknowingly, we have been conditioned to grimace at the mention of certain nations, and our preconceived ideas of these countries have unjustly marred their inhabitants. HONY's World Tour has moved past this metaphorical fog of perception and connected us to strangers thousands of miles away. 
<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Instead of being presented as an anonymous news crawl at the bottom of our screens, the victims are profoundly humanized in an unprecedented way.
</span></blockquote>


HONY has documented countries recently and currently ravaged by conflict and social issues, through portraits of a father walking home with his daughter from school in Ukraine to a young couple reviewing the progress of their second date in India. The World Tour documented Iraq and Jordan during the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria's (ISIS) siege of Northern Syria and Iraq, and many of the portraits were imbued with despondency, with a caption of one reading: "We left our hopes back in Syria". One cannot help but empathize with such loss and isolation. Instead of being presented as an anonymous news crawl at the bottom of our screens, the victims are profoundly humanized in an unprecedented way. The tales of raids, sieges, and violence become personalized, the individual experiences of loss form a tragic mosaic. 

<div class="xxxx2"><img alt="" src="http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/HONY1-.jpg" /><div style="float: left; line-height: 132%; margin-top: 10px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; font-size: 70%; color: #000; font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2';"><span style="padding: 0px 8px 3px 0px;">"He stays always in the Dome of the Rock. Children come to him for blessings. He can’t see, but his mind is perfect. He only has to hear your voice — and he’ll remember your name, your mobile number, and even the anniversary of your mother’s death." (Jerusalem)</span> <span style="font-family: Open Sans; font-size: 80%; color: #afafaf;">Humans of New York</span> </div></div>

Yet, as harrowing as these accounts and portraits are, we also subconsciously acquire a different type of wisdom: resilience. We learn that the human experience is indeed universal; we all desire love and success despite the circumstances in our own nation. In the midst of the compassion that inevitably stems from HONY, it is just as important to learn that the majority of these strangers overcome their struggles. A woman in the Ukraine who had been sexually abused and then had her arm amputated after a suicide attempt went on to pursue a career of easing other's pain and anxiety. A young South Sudanese girl who lives in a displaced persons' camp spoke of her ambition to be a pilot, to be "a leader of the air". Our sense of empathy is rekindled as we read the tale of an Iraqi man who volunteered his own life to restore the health of her brain. We learn that compassion is congruent with resilience. We learned through the HONY World Tour that whilst different languages and customs may act as barriers, we are essentially all the same. 

Humans of New York, especially with its World Tour, reminds of me of a fantastic F. Scott Fitzgerald quote: "That is part of the beauty of literature. You discover that your longings are universal longings, that you're not lonely and isolated from anyone. You Belong." These portraits do just that - by showing us we not only live in the world we inhabit, but that we also belong.

		<title>Enda Kenny to Launch Trinity&#039;s Strategic Plan</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Jack Leahy</strong> | <em>News Editor</em>

Taoiseach Enda Kenny will launch the College's 2014-19 Strategic Plan next week, <em>The University Times</em> has learned.

An Taoiseach will attend and speak at a launch event on Wednesday October 22nd, having accepted an invitation from Provost, Patrick Prendergast, last week.

The Strategic Plan is the articulation of College's strategic objectives for the next five years. It is expected to deal with the issues of student numbers, non-exchequer funding sources, and curriculum reform.

Consultation on the document's content has been ongoing for over a year and those represented on working groups include students, academic staff, administrative and service staff, and College executive officers.

The previous strategic plan prioritised, among other objectives, College's globalisation mission and a re-evaluation of branding and identity. The former came into being in the form of the Global Relations Strategy, launched in 2011, and the Identity Initiative, which is now understood to sit on Trinity's strategic back-burner.

Kenny had previously been invited to address the Global Graduates Forum in November 2013 but declined the invitation due to scheduling conflicts. His government was instead represented by now Minister for Health, Leo Varadkar, a Trinity alumnus.

		<title>Fourth Week: There&#039;s no Good Reason not to Try Something</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Paul Behan</strong> | <em>Societies Editor</em>

So next week is Fourth Week. Essentially it’s Trinity’s society festival and a chance for you to enjoy some free events. The Central Societies Committee gives societies special grants to put on free events for everyone. It is not necessary to be a member of a society to attend its Fourth Week event. In fact, it’s the only opportunity you have to "try before you buy" with student societies. Plus, during fourth week, the crowd won’t just be the active members of societies. There’ll be plenty of other new faces – so if you’re nervous, there’ll be strength in numbers. Also, wine. There’s literally no good reason not to go try something fun and new for free (and possibly make new mates), so like as much as it literally physically pains me to use a hashtag in an article, #GoFourth.

<h4 style="color: #8F1163; font-size: 145%; margin: 18px 0px 20px 0px; display: block;">The Best of Fourth Week</h4>

<div style="font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; float: left; padding: 4px 2% 4px 2%; margin: 4px 10px 5px 0px; display: block; background: #8F1163; color: white; font-size: 168%; text-align: centre; line-height: 126%; font-weight: 100;">1</div>




<h4 style="color: #8F1163; font-size: 100%; margin: 6px 0px 3px 0px;"><a style="padding-bottom: 1px; border-bottom: 2px solid #cbcbcb; color: #8F1163; font-size: 100%; margin: 4px 0px 3px 0px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/artsfestival">Trinity Art’s Festival’s Fourth Week Event</a> – Friday, 7pm, The GMB</h4>

<p style="display:block; margin: 4px 0px 10px 0%;">Building on the success of their best event-winning <em>Through the Looking Glass</em>, TAF are back with another open-house extravaganza. Quickly becoming a college institution, the TAF fourth-week event is a visual and artistic feast. I can’t tell you too much but essentially TAF are collaborating with a rake of other societies to bring a certain very famous piece of literature back to life in an interactive, theatrical, artistic experience. It’s all being kept under wraps so far but I’m very excited.</p>

<div style="clear:both; height: 20px;"></div>




<div style="font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; float: left; padding: 4px 2% 4px 2%; margin: 6px 10px 5px 0px; display: block; background: #8F1163; color: white; font-size: 168%; text-align: centre; line-height: 126%; font-weight: 100;">2</div>

<h4 style="color: #8F1163; font-size: 100%; margin: 4px 0px 3px 0px;"><a style="padding-bottom: 1px; border-bottom: 2px solid #cbcbcb; color: #8F1163; font-size: 100%; margin: 4px 0px 3px 0px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/723800347713108/?ref=ts&fref=ts">Zoo Soc presents Falconry</a> – Thursday, 1pm, The Cricket Pitch</h4>

<p style="display:block; margin: 4px 0px 10px 0%;">Falcons! Actual Falcons! I found this difficult to process and it kind of makes me feel enraged at every other student society for not bringing falcons – but the important thing is that this is happening and we can deal with the emotional fallout later. Make sure to get down early because the event already has over two hundred people attending on Facebook.</p>

<div style="clear:both; height: 20px;"></div>




<div style="font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; float: left; padding: 4px 2% 4px 2%; margin: 6px 10px 5px 0px; display: block; background: #8F1163; color: white; font-size: 168%; text-align: centre; line-height: 126%; font-weight: 100;">3</div>

<h4 style="color: #8F1163; font-size: 100%; margin: 4px 0px 3px 0px; line-height: 150%;"><a style="padding-bottom: 1px; border-bottom: 2px solid #cbcbcb; color: #8F1163; font-size: 100%; margin: 4px 0px 3px 0px;" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/327414570774561/?fref=ts">DU History presents "LIBERATOR: The Life & Death of Daniel O'Connell"</a> – Wednesday, 7pm, Glasnevin Cemetery</h4>

 

<p style="display:block; margin: 4px 0px 10px 0%;">This event essentially entails a spooky location, one of the most enjoyable orators in Ireland (Prof. Patrick Geoghegan) and a discussion on the historic hun known as the Liberator. There’s also talk of some kind of themed bus. If Shonda Rhimes was an ardent Irish nationalist and organised history themed events, this would be one of those events.</p>

		<title>Official Opening of Extended 24-Hour Library to Take Place Thursday</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Sinéad Baker</strong> | <em>Co-Editor-at-Large</em>

The official opening of Kinsella Hall, the extended 24-hour section of the Ussher library, is to take place on Thursday October 16th, after work on the conversion was completed over the summer.

The second and third floors of the Ussher library have been converted so that the study spaces can remain open 24 hours a day, like the current 24-hour library, which up to now, consisted of just the first floor of the library. The second and third floors are due to be opened for 24-hour use on a phased basis.

The event is being held to thank Eric Kinsella, an alumnus of Trinity College Dublin who donated money towards the project. The section of the Ussher tower in use for the 24-hour library has been renamed Kinsella Hall in his honour.

Trinity has said that Kinsella, with his donation, has helped the college “to realise [their] long held dream of making three floors of the Ussher Tower into overnight study space."

Present at the event will be College Officials, including the Provost and library staff, as well as student representatives and guests. 

Speaking to <em>The University Times</em>, Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union (TCDSU) Education Officer, Katie Byrne, commented: “The addition of this extra 24-hour space will make such a difference to so many students and the SU would like to extend our sincere gratitude to Mr Kinsella for facilitating the refurbishments”. 

The conversion went ahead after data from the 2012/2013 academic year showed high usage of the Berkley Lecky Ussher library complex when it remained open 24/7 for ten weeks.

The extension of the 24-hour library space was agreed upon in 2013 between the then-Dean of Students, the Vice Provost and TCDSU officers. As well as Mr Kinsella’s donation, the project was part-financed by a fund that is under the direction of the Dean of Students and TCDSU. The fund came about after a case in 2012 in which the Higher Education Authority ruled that College was giving excess allowances to teaching staff. Trinity was ordered to spend €500,000 on additional student services. 

The library and TCDSU have been meeting since July 2013 to discuss the project.

Work on converting the additional floors of the Ussher library was due to begin in January 2014, but the project was delayed until the summer.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4 style="padding-top: 15px;"><span style="color: #8f1163; font-size: 140%;">Trinity Arts Workshop Ceramics Workshops</span></h4> 
<strong>Paul Behan</strong> | <em>Societies Editor</em>

So it began with a wander through the corridors of Goldsmith Hall and my awkwardly stumbling into a real life artist’s studio. I was somewhat nervous about taking the plunge into artistry since my previous forays into art have taught me that I’m a more capable at appreciating art than creating it. Luckily, I was warmly welcomed as I slid into the room with an air like the nervous fresher I’m not.

Patrick, our friendly guide for the evening, put us straight to work after a simple demonstration. We built up little by little. My little ambition was a ceramic sea-shell that I designed in my head as I went on. We were too fofmative to be put on the wheel but we got a chance to see some advanced sculptors doing their work. The room was beautifully decorated with the piecemeal work of the students going before us and it gives you a sense of what you might be able to make if you keep going back.  
 
There was something wonderfully therapeutic of just working away, having a chill little chat with the other people and making something. The entire affair was remarkably chill and it seemed like no time at all had passed when it was over. Overall the event was really quite surprisingly wonderful. I didn’t expect it to be so accessible and actually being able to “do art” felt excellent (even if my art isn’t exactly excellent itself). I’m definitely going back to finish my seashell, pictures to follow, and I’ve been inspired to go to more TAW stuff. I didn’t realise the sheer wealth of classes they put on, including screen priniting and still life drawing. My only criticism is one of myself, in that I didn’t think to bring a camera to capture the pieces on display.
 
TAW offers an excellent facility to work at your own level and I couldn’t recommend it more.


<h4 style="padding-top: 15px;"><span style="color: #8f1163; font-size: 140%;">Fashion Soc Swap Shop</span></h4> 


<strong>Lorna Staines</strong> | <em>Contributing Writer</em> 

Swap shop is the idea that a group of people meet up to swap unwanted clothes with friends in a fun, eco-friendly and importantly, cheap way of getting new clothes. It’s an idea that magazines have been cheering about for years but that realistically doesn’t work well in a small group of friends. Here is where Fashion Soc is perfect to step in and do swap shop right. On Monday and Tuesday of the week Fashion Soc collected unwanted clothes off people planning on going and on Wednesday everyone who gave clothes were given vouchers worth the value of the clothes they had handed in to spend on other items at the swap shop. If you were forgetful though (or just too fond of your whole wardrobe) you could also just buy the super cheap clothes.
 
The swap shop took place in the parlor of the JCR Café and for a bit of showmanship they let the excited group gather around waiting for the doors to be flung open at five. Inside the parlour, there were railings and pool tables covered in clothes, and a sort of polite bedlam ensued. All was calm at first but when people started to pick up clothes from the table, a policy of "grab any clothes you might possibly like and decide later" began. Thankfully half the room had been left bare for this exact idea and a fun game started of spying on other peoples hastily grabbed clothes to see which ones they were going to put back.

Because of the grabbing policy, shopping didn’t end after the first search either. Every time you returned, some new items had appeared and even those who did not arrive exactly on time found stuff they loved.
 
The one drawback of the event was no make-shift changing areas and a very large wall of glass looking straight out onto Pearse Street, making trying on clothes to see if they fit an awkward affair.

However people made do and many happy swappers left with black plastic sacks full of new clothes, while one luminous yellow dress was left on its own, hanging from a rack. 


<h4 style="padding-top: 15px;"><span style="color: #8f1163; font-size: 140%;">TES Talks with Mark Little</span></h4>

<strong>Ludivine Rebet</strong> | <em>Contributing Writer</em>

"Hi. My name is Stephen Flynn and I’m looking for a mentor. Can I buy you a pint?"
 
This is the question that won one self-assured student a free ticket to the WebSummit at last Monday’s TES Talk and Q&A with Mark Little.
 
Mark is one of Ireland's leading journalists. He left his post in RTÉ in 2009 to found his own social media news startup, Storyful, which was set to become the premier news agency of the social media age.
 
"When I became a reporter, almost 20 years ago, my job was to dig up scarce, precious facts and deliver them to a passive audience. Today, scarcity has been replaced by an unimaginable surplus and that audience is actively building its own newsroom. That’s the insight that drove me to create Storyful, the first news agency for the social media age."
 
The former Trinity student then became a self-made millionaire when he sold his start-up business for $25m (that’s €18m) to Rupert Murdoch and News Corp last year.
 
The talk was marked by a light-hearted atmosphere and humour, which juxtaposed interestingly with a striking honesty and openness on behalf of Mark when he shared his experiences, failures, successes and advice with us. He had a lot to teach about entrepreneurship. First of all, entrepreneurship is about more than business. He pointed to his involvement in societies and the students' union when he was a Trinity student as his first, and most formative, work experience as an entrepreneur. Secondly, entrepreneurs aren’t "just lucky". They don’t just stumble across amazing ideas and lay back, watching the millions roll in. Rather, they work extremely hard. He also tells us to "Forget about technology!". According to Mark, "you need to know the human behaviour that drives the change". He drew an analogy with the Heisenburg principle and argued that "it’s not about the object – it’s about the momentum of the object and where it’s going". He doesn’t feel that the business opportunity that he identified was a technological one, but rather it spawned from cultural change.
 
The talk was laden with stories, life advice and refreshing honesty about the dark side of entrepreneurship. Little cautioned that with the highs come some extremely low lows. Furthermore, when asked about ethics in business, he had no qualms in saying that integrity sometimes needs to be compromised. He unashamedly stated that money was the end goal and that your principles don’t always come for free in the big bad business world. On a more positive note he discussed his excitement about Dublin as a vibrant and growing start-up capital. His take is that we have been freed by the Celtic Tiger and are now taking risks and thinking about failure in a much healthier way. Indeed, failure, in his eyes is <em>the</em> most important ingredient of entrepreneurship and we must be willing to embrace it. He gave more insights and advice on a broad range of topics, from journalism to tech, and human resource management to friendship.
 
I certainly got a lot more from this talk than I expected when told by my lecturer for an ‘innovation, entrepreneurship and new venture development’ module that we’d have a guest speaker in instead of our usual lecture. Incidentally, Mark Little’s own business mentor will be speaking to TES this Monday at 3pm in the Robert Emmet Theatre. If last week’s event was anything to go off of, I’d definitely recommend the next one.

		<title>Editorial: A Welcome Start to Ireland Discussing the Funding Issues in Third-level Education</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The higher education sector is one of the best-performing sectors in Ireland, but it comes as a surprise to no-one that it’s in a perilous position. Trinity’s Provost, and Chair of the Irish Universities Association (IUA), Patrick Prendergast, opened the association's recent symposium on the performance and sustainability of higher education in Ireland. The event was essentially a reaction to what seems to be fact: that current levels of funding to third-level education is inadequate if Ireland wants to have a world-class education system.

That Trinity receives 40 per cent less funding than the universities in the top 100 is something we cannot ignore if we don’t want to continue to slip in the rankings, or continue to lose staff and student services (and the most recent set of rankings published shows that all of Ireland’s universities are heading downwards). It seems that the limit has been reached as to what Irish universities can achieve without a change in its funding model. That Prendergast, when running for Provost, suggested he may consider leaving the IUA, now chairs the organisation can be seen as a sign that the funding issue is too large to ignore, and that debate on the issue simply has to be started.
 
At the moment, our higher education system is still highly respected globally. It’s a fact that, if this system fails, so too will many sectors of our economy – but this fact is generally ignored.

The presence of government officials at the symposium is a positive sign that they are recognising the link between the strength of the higher education sector and the strength of the economy as a whole. Yet Prendergast noted that, in terms of funding, Irish universities simply “can’t compete”. This is a frightening prospect – that without further investment from higher education, there seems to be no where to go but down.

That the debate is restarting, and that the Provost reckons “we don't need to fix the system” are welcome developments. The Provost’s comments last Monday at the question and answer session were also welcome, when he said it wasn’t his purpose “to ensure Trinity is privatised”, but that his purpose and duty “is to ensure that we’re funded – that we can continue to deliver the quality of education people expect.”

We can only hope that this development into examining the importance of funding higher education isn’t forgotten in tomorrow’s budget.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Union of Students in Ireland’s Rally for Education, held last Wednesday in Dublin, should be commended. While the feeling is that estimates of 6,000 people turning out may be overblown, certainly several thousand people made their way from the Garden of Remembrance – in poor weather conditions – to stand outside Dáil Eireann on Molesworth St. Not very long ago, students were seen as rebellious – as fighters who weren’t simply going to take cuts, as advocates who wanted to have a say in decisions, and as demonstrators who weren’t going to let their voices not be heard.

When we say it wasn’t very long ago, it really wasn’t: in 2011, one thousand Trinity students participated in a similar rally. In 2011, and in the years before that, students were literally seen as the only ones who were protesting. Because not many other people were. We heard how the Greeks were protesting, while the vast majority of Irish people sat at home. Students were the anomaly. We were the ones who weren’t apathetic. We were disillusioned, yes, but we turned that disillusionment into something that we felt was worth fighting for. 

Be it through poor organisation on the part of The Union of Students in Ireland and its constituent students’ unions, or through some other quirk, this kind of engagement from students very quickly and very dramatically dissipated. Before last Wednesday, the common refrain from Trinity students, nearly all of whom were not there in 2011 to see a thousand turn out, would have been that students just didn’t care – and even if they did, there was little point in turning out to protest, because it wouldn’t change anything. Last year, only 25 Trinity students made their way to the gates of Leinster House, which is merely a short hop from the Arts Block and an even shorter hop from the Hamilton building.

In comparison, between 250 and 300 students leaving from Trinity’s Front Gate last week to participate in the wider horde of thousands seems extremely impressive. But it’s important to see it in the not-so-distant context that no-one of the current vintage can recall: a quarter of the turnout that we had less than five years ago is anything but remarkable.

And while it isn’t remarkable, a year-on-year increase that brings the Trinity contingent from 25 to 250 should be commended. But it should be seen as a reboot and a new beginning to Trinity’s student movement, rather than anything mightier – something to be built upon.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Aisling Curtis</strong> | <em>Senior Staff Writer
</em>

When somebody is called smart we immediately know what that means: an inherent attribute that is for some hopelessly unattainable, and for others a label they’ve been dogged with since their first childhood spelling bee. An attribute that is a slur in some circles and the greatest compliment in others, its very fabric replete with expectation to achieve in a certain academic way.

But shouldn’t we consider other manifestations of being smart?

Take, for example, somebody with a deep and encompassing knowledge of the Harry Potter world. Maybe they don’t get straight As in their Leaving, and maybe their vocabulary isn’t as extensive as they’d like, and maybe Kiev could just as easily be the garlic chicken as the capital of Ukraine - but they can tell you the intricacies of seven books, eight movies, and an exhaustive backdrop of details and tidbits and themes. Are they not just as intelligent as the traditional maths nerd?

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Our notion of intelligence in Ireland is just that: <em>ours.</em> Not everybody’s. Which means we can allow it to change.</span></blockquote>


In 1967, the developmental psychologist Howard Gardner challenged the prevailing theories of the time by proposing a Theory of Multiple Intelligences, which argued that people process information in different ways - eight, to be precise. Instead of domination by one ability - a general intelligence that is the basis of modern IQ tests - he believed that intelligence could be divided into these different areas, all largely independent of each other, with individuals expressing a blend of types rather than a single manifestation.

It’s the kind of theory that appeals to us on a fundamental level, which is why we should be wary of it. And – perhaps unfortunately – the empirical evidence is not strong, relying heavily upon subjective judgement and a feeling of “rightness” rather than testable proof.

But critics don’t disagree with the notion that people can be smart in a range of ways, only with the methodology and the strictness of calling these traits “intelligences” when “intelligence” has generally been defined as the skills associated with school. On a rigid theoretical level, Gardner has been dismissed, but on a broader, more subjective plane the crux of his ideas carry weight. Although they may not manifest on a general intelligence test, musical, spatial, linguistic, interpersonal and intrapersonal abilities can bestow a greater operational smartness upon a person than any ability to classify shapes into patterned rows.

What’s more, even Gardner’s questionable intelligences can only be extrapolated to those of us who hail from the Western world. In other cultures, what’s considered ‘intelligent’ can be nothing like smartness here. In Zimbabwe, intelligence is being cautious, particularly in social relationships; in Zambia, it’s obedience and responsibility; Asian conceptions of intelligence include determination, and even feelings and opinions. Our notion of intelligence in Ireland is just that: <em>ours.</em> Not everybody’s. Which means we can allow it to change.


<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>We place value on specific types of knowledge and certain skills, often for the lone reason that such skills are culturally esteemed.</span></blockquote>



Maybe it’s time to alter the traditional tune of “how smart are you?”, to reconsider assigning people to boxes based on their subjectively objective test scores. In a working world where career is no longer a rhythmic progression from promotion to stagnation to retirement, people move horizontally and vertically, backwards and forwards, between disparate jobs over their working lives. It has become “<em>how </em>are you smart?”, <em>how </em>can you demonstrate interpersonal capacity in a highly connected world, <em>how </em>can you find artistic solutions to more intricate questions, <i>how </i>can you help solve the complexities that loom over the modern world.

We place value on specific types of knowledge and certain skills, often for the lone reason that such skills are culturally esteemed. Is somebody who can learn a vast array of testable facts really more intelligent than somebody who can recall each celebrity couple of the last ten years, or somebody else who knows every up and down of the World Cup? A freer interpretation of <em>intelligence</em> would allow more potential, more diversity, a greater array of skills to the ones we’ve been taught to revere.

More smart people empowered by their own intelligence – no matter what strange, unexpected flavour of intelligence that might be – might even make the rest of us smarter, too.

		<title>The Rising Cost of Accommodation Won&#039;t Stop Any Year Soon</title>

Dublin is in the grips of an accommodation crisis. This is not new to students who have recently started studying at Trinity. Rising prices combined with a shortage of suitable accommodation is making it increasingly difficult to find somewhere to live for the academic year.

<h4 style="padding-top: 15px;"><span style="color: #8f1163; font-size: 140%;">Costly Living</span></h4>

Rental costs have been soaring over recent years, since 2011 by 26%. This has accelerated over the past year with prices increasing by around 15% in these 12 months. According to the Irish Times there is a year on year increase of 17.2% in the city centre, i.e. the areas closest to Trinity and most attractive to its students. In real terms this equates to a 500 euro rent increasing by 75 euro.

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>There is a year on year increase of 17.2% in rental costs in the city centre
</span></blockquote>

This is reinforced by a lack of available accommodation for rent. This year has seen a 40% reduction in available student accommodation. This is a particularly worrying statistic when you remember that the number of students arriving in Dublin each year is certainly rising year on year. In certain hotspots such as the South Circular Road, enquiries into rental properties have increased by 200%. Whilst interest in certain areas on the north side, such as Drumcondra and Glasnevin, has trebled in the past two years. More and more students are competing with professionals and young families for accommodation who are also feeling the financial strain.

<h4 style="padding-top: 15px;"><span style="color: #8f1163; font-size: 140%;">Avoiding the Dublin Colleges</span></h4>

It’s feared that the accommodation crisis might soon get to a point where many potential students will choose to study somewhere more affordable. They already do it in some numbers but it might reach a critical point where this drastically affects the quality of Dublin college entrants in future years.  John O’Connor, Chief Executive of the Housing Agency, has suggested that where possible students should consider the costs of accommodation when making their course choices. As a direct effect of the accommodation crisis he argues students should consider looking for accommodation along commuter routes, outside of the immediate vicinity of the college or University. 

<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Enquiries into rental properties have increased by 200%
</span></blockquote>

This will undoubtedly increase the numbers of students who are choosing to live with family rather than branching out on their own. For many this is fine, but for those who have to commute on a regular basis from the outskirts of county Dublin or commuter zones such as Meath or Kildare it can become a problem. Aside from the cost of transport it may lead to students missing out. Instead of becoming independent adults setting out on their own or making the most of the social side to the University experience they will have to be constantly aware of when to catch the last bus and their parents feelings. And of course there is the physical effect, the tiredness of having to get up at 5:30 am in order to navigate public transport in order to be on time for a 9 am lecture.

Those hoping to move out of the parental home but still save money by commuting may also find their options narrowing as rental costs in Dublin’s commuter counties are also rising – slower than Dublin yes, but again one has to consider the accumulated costs, both financial and psychological, of commuting.

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>Over two years the student accommodation in Dublin’s commuter counties has decreased from around 2,000 to 600 properties
</span></blockquote>

<h4 style="padding-top: 15px;"><span style="color: #8f1163; font-size: 140%;">Little Acommodation Left</span></h4>

Daft.ie’s in house economist,  Mr Lyons, has stated that over the past two years the numbers of available student rental accommodation in Dublin’s commuter counties has decreased from around 2,000 to 600 properties. However in general this is still a better option than some of the rental accommodation available in the city. There is strong evidence that a huge proportion of rental rooms and properties are in a sub – standard condition.

According to Councillor Ray McAdam’s Summer 2014 Stoneybatter newsletter although rental standards are improving it is a slow process. In this area of Dublin 7 alone over the past two years 5114 rental units were inspected. Only 614 met rental standards.Of the 999 units inspected along the North Circular Road, only 145 met the legal requirements for rental properties. If prices continue to rise there is a strong chance that increasing numbers of students will feel they have no choice but to pay extortionate rents for this sub – standard and possibly illegal accommodation.

Rents are also increasing elsewhere in Ireland. With the cost of renting having risen by 6 – 7% in Cork, Galway and Limerick. Although this is a significant increase it begs the question of whether prospective Trinity students may be more inclined to study outside of Dublin due to the financial pressures. For example the average rent in Dublin of all types is around 1300 euro, whereas average rental costs in Cork are 866 euro and Limerick even less at 680 euro.

Those who do stay in or move to Dublin have to face the added pressure of worrying about finances rather than just their academic studies. And of course not only does the cost affect you all year round,  the stress of just looking for suitable and affordable accommodation is increasingly seeping into the start of term with some students finding it takes weeks, occasionally several months, to find somewhere suitable to live.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><strong>Cormac Shine</strong> | <em>Editor-at-Large</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">One thing is certain about the expected referendum on equal marriage next spring: it will be won or lost by our generation. It’s a simple fact that those under 25 overwhelmingly support the introduction of equal marriage for gay and straight couples, but it’s also true that those under 25 are the least likely to vote. The Students’ Union has a very important and specific role to play in the wider campaign for equal marriage over the next few months: making sure Trinity students are registered to vote, and getting them to the polls.</p>
SU representatives conducted a straw poll throughout Freshers’ Week to gauge how many students are already registered to vote, and contrary to the very low figures one might expect, the results are actually somewhat heartening. Of all 800 students polled over a five day period, almost 65% are already registered to vote.
<blockquote class="bqnewright">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>The results are somewhat heartening – almost 65% are already registered to vote.
</span></blockquote>
Of these, first years are the least likely to be registered, with only 51% registered to vote (keep in mind that this poll was conducted during Freshers’ Week when there are no classes – there may be a skew towards those more inclined to engage in community activity, and thus the figures may be slightly overstated). Figures were pretty constant across all disciplines, with the percentage of those registered to vote in AHSS, EMS, and health sciences ranging from 62% to 67%.
<p dir="ltr">What can be done to improve these figures, and to make sure they actually get to the polling booths? SU representatives have been visiting Halls in order to register freshers and guide them through this unnecessarily complex process, and this needs to continue until every student knows the basics of the process and has been given the opportunity to do so with minimal stress. In a community that has near-universal support for equal marriage, it’s imperative to get as many people on the register as possible, and the current figures simply aren’t good enough.</p>

<blockquote class="bqnewleft">
<div style="width: 35%; height: 12px; background: #000; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div>
<span>There is an inherent challenge for a referendum seeking to change the status quo, and the challenge of facing a small but no doubt vocal opposition may bring the numbers down.</span></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">A poll conducted in February by RTE’s Prime Time and the Sunday Business Post points to 76% support for equal marriage, but it’s clear that there is an inherent challenge for a referendum seeking to change the status quo, and the challenge of facing a small but no doubt vocal opposition may bring these numbers down. The outlook is good now, but complacency is not something we can afford in a generation-defining poll that may not come around again soon. Remember, this is the country that legalized divorce in 1995 by 0.56% of the vote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ireland has changed a lot in the last twenty years. For a country that only officially legalized homosexuality in 1993 thanks to the tireless campaigning of Senator David Norris and others, it’s clear LGBT* rights have improved a lot. But there’s still a long way to go, and on the other side of the coin it’s not too hard to see that many older generations might not vote Yes when it comes down to it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to make its contribution and live up to its mandated support for equal marriage and general support for LGBT* issues, the SU needs a focused and targeted plan to get people registered, walk them through the process and to get them to the polls when the date is announced.</p>

		<title>Trinity Students Most Likely to Finish with First or Upper Second-class Degree</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Patrick Lavelle</strong> | <em>College Affairs Editor</em>

Trinity College Dublin students have a higher chance of graduating with a first class honours or 2.1 degree than students in any of the state’s other six universities according to figures published by the <em>Irish Times</em> today.

Over the last 10 years, 71.7 per cent of Trinity graduates have received a 1.1 or 2.1 degree. Dublin City University (DCU) awarded the second highest rate of such degrees (64.3 per cent), followed by University College Cork (64.2 per cent), University College Dublin (55.8 per cent), NUI Galway (54.7 per cent), NUI Maynooth (53.7 per cent) and University of Limerick (50.2 per cent).

Trinity College is reported by the <em>Irish Times</em> to have attributed this figure to the fact that it attracted “exceptionally bright cohorts of students”.

The figure rises significantly further for certain departments within Trinity, with over 90 per cent of Trinity law graduates receiving a first or 2.1. It was also reported that only eight of the 301 students who sat psychology in Trinity between 2004 and 2013 failed to achieve a 2.1 or a first.

When looking only at the percentage of students who graduated with a first class honours degree over the past 10 years, Trinity comes third of the seven Irish universities. 16.4 per cent of Trinity students got a first, compared to 17.7 per cent in UCC and DCU, the highest nationwide, and only 11.9 per cent in UCD, the lowest.

The figures follow controversy earlier this year over comments made by Paddy Cosgrave, founder of The Web Summit, that he would accept interns with a 2.1 from Trinity, while graduates of other universities would be required to have a first.

Cosgrave expressed concern about grade inflation in higher education in Ireland saying that “a 2.1 in one university would not equate to a 2.1 in another university”.

Speaking to the <em>Irish Times</em>, Martin O’Grady, a lecturer at IT Tralee who started a “Stop Grade Inflation” campaign a decade ago, said the high rate of firsts and 2.1s at Trinity was understandable as “they show all the signs of getting a premium student” through the CAO. He took issue however with the wide differences between DCU and UL who had “fairly identical profiles”.

<p dir="ltr">The student maintenance grant and Back to Education Allowance will remain at their current levels and eligibility criteria for 2015. Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin announced no change to the supports when presenting his budgetary statement this afternoon.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The student contribution charge will, as expected, increase by €250 to €3,000. Former Minister for Education and Skills Ruairí Quinn had, in 2012, announced plans for the charge to increase gradually from €2,000 to €3,000 by 2015.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other announcements with relevance to the student body includes an exemption from Universal Social Charge for those working part-time up to €12,000 per annum, a 20c increase in the price of roll-your-own tobacco and a 40c increase in the price of cigarettes. A ban on Civil Service recruitment has been lifted, and departments will be empowered to decide on staffing levels within the agreed budgetary framework.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The education budget will benefit from an exchequer contribution of €8.3 billion, including an increase of 1,700 full-time teaching positions (920 mainstream teachers, 480 resource teachers,365 Special Needs Assistants) no increase in class sizes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That student supports have been protected is no surprise, given Minister Jan O’Sullivan’s announcement last month that protecting the grant was one of her priorities in office. Nonetheless, student representatives will not have rested easy ahead of the announcement following successive years of cuts to the third-level sector.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Union of Students in Ireland will release a full report on the Budget for students this evening.</p>

		<title>&quot;We&#039;re not exactly breathing sighs of relief&quot; – USI reacts to Budget 2015</title>

The Union of Students in Ireland has welcomed a number of budgetary measures announced today, but President Laura Harmon insists they're "not exactly breathing sighs of relief" as third-level fees continue to rise.

The national student representative body has welcomed the decision not to cut or otherwise amend the student maintenance grant and the Back to Education Allowance, and has described the decision to return €25 million to colleges as "good news for education".

However, it has criticised the decision to follow through on planned increases in the student contribution charge, which it describes as "a major increase in the cost of college". The charge was increased for the fifth consecutive year as part of planned increases to gradually bring the charge from €2,000 and €3,000.

The organisation has engaged in extensive lobbying over the last number of months, focusing on the protection of student supports. A protest march to that end attracted up to 6,000 attendees last week.

It has also welcomed announcements on provisions to build more housing, which  it says "should in due course relieve pressure on rental prices in Dublin and across the country."

Speaking after the announcements, USI President Harmon said that she was happy to see "student concerns heeded in the development of the budget" but that fee increases amounted to further "enormous pressures":
<blockquote>"We’re glad that students reliant on the Back to Education Allowance and Student Maintenance Grant won’t experience further cuts, and we’re pleased that the money withheld from the third level system for two years is being returned. These provisions were key to our pre-budget asks.

"In addition, the re-balancing of the grant will make things easier for students in the difficult first semester of study – showing that student concerns have been heeded in the development of the budget.

"Whilst we’re glad that no new cuts to student supports will be introduced in this budget, we’re not exactly breathing sighs of relief. The escalator on student contribution fees adds €250 more on to fees which are the second highest student fees in Europe, placing enormous financial pressure on students and families."</blockquote>
Meanwhile, Fianna Fáil spokesperson for Education Charlie McConalogue has released a statement condemning today's budgetary measures:
<blockquote>"Today’s budget is a massive disappointment to all those who believe in investment in education. Minister O’Sullivan has failed to deliver and will oversee further reductions in education services in the coming year."</blockquote>
