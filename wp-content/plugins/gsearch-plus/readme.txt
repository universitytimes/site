geeSearch Plus plugin works behind the scenes by optimizing and changing the default WordPress search query. If you would like to have a search box on a sidebar or as a widget, just use the WordPress default search widget and geeSearch plus will do the hard work!

= What do I need to know if I'm using Stella multi-language plugin? =
If you'd like to remove the correct language stopwords from your search query when using the Stella plugin, then go to **geeSearch Plus** settings and change the *Remove Stopwords by language* to the option *Use stopwords files according to Stella languages*.
In order get this working properly you need to make sure there is a stopwords file per each configured language on your site. Check at the `/wp-content/plugins/gsearch-plus/stop` directory for the files. You'll find there are already several files pre-loaded with the geeSearch Plus plugin (English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Czech, German, Finnish, French, Polish, Dutch and more). You may edit those files to include/remove stopwords, or add new files. When adding new stopwords files name them as *stopwords-[LANGUAGE].php*, where LANGUAGE is a two letter code representing the Stella language (en -> English, de -> German, and so on).
