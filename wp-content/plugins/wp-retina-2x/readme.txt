Make your website look beautiful and crisp on Retina / High DPI displays.

== Description ==

This plugin creates the image files required by the Retina (High DPI) devices and displays them to your visitors accordingly. Your website will look beautiful and crisp on every device! The retina images will be generated for you automatically - though you can also do it manually - and served to the retina devices.

It supports different methods to serve the images to your visitors, for instance: PictureFill (future HTML standard + its JS polyfill), Retina.js (JS only), IMG Rewrite (on-the-fly HTML rewrite) and Retina-Images (server handler). A lazy-loading option is available as well. Pick the one that works best with your hosting and WordPress environment. Multi-site are also supported.

The plugin is very fast and optimized. It doesn't create anything in the database. In most cases, it doesn't even require any configuration. More information and tutorial available one http://apps.meow.fr/wp-retina-2x/.

Languages: English, French.

= Quickstart =

1. Set your option (for instance, you probably don't need retina images for every sizes set-up in your WP).
2. Generate the retina images (required only the first time, then images are generated automatically).
3. Check if it works! - if it doesn't, read the FAQ, the tutorial, and check the forums.
