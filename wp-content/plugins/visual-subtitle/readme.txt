Allows part of a post title to be styled as a subtitle. It is still within the title heading, but is wrapped in a span to be styled differently.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a Visual Subtitle field to all post, page and custom post types that have support for a title.

It allows you to include a string of text that will still be part of the post title, but be wrapped in a `span` tag, giving something like:

`<h1>Visual Subtitle<span class="subtitle"></span></h1>`

Keeping it as part of the main level 1 or two heading, means it maintains as much keyword SEO importance as the main title, yet can be given a style (in your own theme) of `display: block;` to make it visually appear as a subtitle.

The visual subtitle is appended to to the title on on the Posts screen, separated with a pipe (`|`) character, and appended to the title part of the document title with a colon (`:`) character.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload `visual-subtitle` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the separators? =

Only currently by amending the plugin code.

= My subtitle isn't appearing on a new line? =

You need to add the `.subtitle { display: block; }` style to your own theme, along with any other styling you want for it.

== Screenshots ==

1. The back-end interface, showing the Visual Subtitle field.
1. Showing the visual subtitle on the front-end, in this case, styled red, smaller, italic and bold.
1. The front-end markup, showing the span inside the existing heading element (may differ for your own theme).
1. Showing the subtitle in the Posts list - the second entry has no subtitle.
1. The subtitle can also be amended from the quick edit feature.
