{"Body": "Young Fine Gael has today passed a motion calling for legislation against mandatory membership of students' unions and the Union of Students in Ireland.\n\nYoung Fine Gael delegates at the first annual Garret Fitzgerald Summer School in Killarney passed the motion, which called for an amendment to the Universities Act 1997 to ban mandatory membership of both local and national Unions. The summer school is a congress-style event for members of Fine Gael's youth division established in honour of the late former Taoiseach.\n\nA motion passed at these events can form policy of the youth organisation, who may then lobby party Senators and TDs, table motions at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis and run public campaigns as they see fit to achieve its fulfilment as full party policy.\n\nThe Universities Act does not directly stipulate mandatory membership of local unions, though many have interpreted such to be heavily implied. Students in Ireland automatically become members of their local Students' Union upon registration.\n\nIndividual unions then vote to become members of the USI, in doing so electing to pay a &euro;8 membership fee along with the annual payment of the student contribution charge.\n\nThough the motion at first appears unaware of the stipulations of the Act, it is understood that the object is to insert a new article in the existing legislation that would allow students to elect to cancel membership of their local students' union. This would in turn remove any association between the student and the USI.\n\nIn a statement to <em>The University Times</em>, USI President John Logue branded the motion 'ill-conceived and reactionary' and urged Young Fine Gael to concentrate on issues of quality of education and funding:\n\n'Students' Unions are often the first point of contact for students facing difficulties during their time in college. They do much of their work away from the public eye, often without recognition.\n\n'The danger with this ill-conceived, reactionary proposal is that most students will never know the true worth of their Students' Union until they need it the most. I would urge YFG to focus on the issues that students care about the most- a quality education, equality of access and going to college without fear of discrimination.'\n\nTrinity's branch of Young Fine Gael have supported calls for TCDSU to disaffiliate from the USI, and are expected to campaign in favour of such in the upcoming membership referendum in late September.\n\nSpeaking to this reporter on behalf of the organisation, TCD Young Fine Gael PRO David Higgins professed support for the motions passed, and reaffirmed its opposition to TCDSU's USI membership:\n\n'Trinity YFG advocates an individual opt out option from Student Unions. In line with the motion passed at the YFG summer school we would like to see it made easier for students to do so.\n\n'We continue to advocate for the disaffiliation of Trinity College from the USI.'", "Imageurl": "11373", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "11369", "Heading": "Young Fine Gael calls for amendment to Universities Act"}
