{"Body": "It was announced yesterday that The Streets are to headline this year&rsquo;s Trinity Ball, with Bell X1 given second billing on the ticket.\n\nMike Skinner&rsquo;s act tops a lineup that includes Jessie J, Simian Mobile Disco, Chipmunk, Professor Green, Fight Like Apes and The Rubberbandits. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a great lineup,&rdquo; said TCDSU Ents Officer Darragh Genockey. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a huge headliner, with talent all the way down the list. I think it&rsquo;s the best lineup in years and fingers crossed students will be happy with it. I think there&rsquo;s something in there for everyone.&rdquo;\nFurther down the lineup are acts which MCD are sure will shoot to prominence in the near future, including Ryan Sheridan, Katy B, Glasser, Bitches With Wolves, Jenna Toro, Devlin, Alex Metric, Starsmith, The Minutes, The Kanyu Tree and Royseven.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1764\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Bell X1, kings of Irish pop\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bell-x1.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bell-x1-300x193.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"bell-x1\" width=\"300\" height=\"193\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1764\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nBest known for their first and second albums, The Streets&rsquo;s popularity peaked with the release of the &ldquo;A Grand Don&rsquo;t Come for Free&rdquo; in 2004. Since then the band has released three albums, with the latest being released only two weeks ago. Critically acclaimed and commercially successful, The Streets have reached the top of the Irish and UK album and singles charts.\n\nThis may well be the last time that Trinity students get the opportunity to see The Streets as Skinner has repeatedly said that their recently released album, &ldquo;Computers and Blues&rdquo;, will be their final studio recording. Skinner is known for crowd interaction and energetic performances, qualities which will go down well with the revelling crowd of the Ball.\n\nThe second headliner, Bell X1, are widely considered to be the best Irish act of the last decade. Fronted by Paul Noonan, the band have enjoyed international success, being regarded as the second largest Irish music act in the US. Too maintain this international profile the band are constantly touring, playing relatively few Irish gigs and so making this booking all the more significant for the Trinity Ball\n\nHaving barely missed out on the Christmas number one slot in the Irish singles charts, The Rubberbandits come to the Trinity Ball with a hugely increased level of popularity from their gig in the GMB last September. The success of &ldquo;Horse Outside&rdquo; and cumulative YouTube hits nearing 8 million have turned the Rubberbandits into a genuine phenomenon and they will surely compete with the top-billed headliners for students&rsquo; attention.\n\nOne act featuring in the Ball who up until recently held the number one spot on the UK singles chart is Jessie J with the song &ldquo;Price Tag&rdquo;. Jessie J launched her solo career debuting &ldquo;Do It Like a Dude&rdquo; as her first single, which charted at number-two on the UK Singles Charts. &ldquo;Price Tag&rdquo; debuted at number one in the UK Singles Chart and held the position for two consecutive weeks.Her debut album, Who You Are, is set to be released February 2011 in the UK and April in the US.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1763\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Jessie J, shy and withdrawn\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/jessie-j.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/jessie-j-300x258.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"jessie-j\" width=\"300\" height=\"258\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1763\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nTrinty Ball verterans, Fight Like Apes make a welcome return having enjoyed great success since their performance two years ago. The Dublin band released their second album, &ldquo;The Body of Christ and the Legs of Tina Turner&rdquo;, last summer to critical acclaim. The album was praised as &ldquo;head-spinning slice of twentysomething life&rdquo; by Hot Press. Known for their frenetic and often rowdy live performances, FLA bring just the right attitude to a Ball that&rsquo;s formal in dress code only.\n\nSimian Mobile Disco and Professor Green (below) beef up the dance music part of the billing.\nThe 52nd Trinity Ball will take place on 8th April 2011.
