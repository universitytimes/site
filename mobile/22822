{"Body": "You are the average student. You are twenty one on the dawn of 2014. You'll have a lifespan of about 100. You are also the first \u00a0generation who's lived in a technology field that greatly changes every two or three years so are will be able to keep up with the technological changes all your life until 2093. It'll be the most important century in civilisations history for the survival of the human race. And here's how it'll go.\r\n<h1><em>Age 21 : 2014</em></h1>\n<h2>Facebook is your life</h2>\r\nThis basically means that Social Media is one of the main ways you interact with technology. Technology only really effects how you socialise in any great way and how you learn in a medium way. It's only really starting to effect how you do business in a real way.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : Definite\r\n<h1><em>Age 25 : 2018</em></h1>\n<h2>Gucci starts doing wearables</h2>\r\nMajor fashion labels start doing pair ups with Apple &amp; Google to create the most fashionable tech wearable. Tech smart-glasses, smart watches, dresses and hats are the must have items. Lady Gaga is probably implanting speakers in her breasts by this stage.\r\n\r\nhttp://instagram.com/p/d9y68yPPbt\r\n\r\nAccuracy : 50/50\r\n<h1><em>Age 30 : 2023</em></h1>\n<h2>Driverless Cars become more real</h2>\r\nhttp://youtu.be/cdgQpa1pUUE\r\n\r\nAlthough you will have seen news stories and mentions of\u00a0driverless cars in America around now you'll have your first real interactions in the real world with them. This is due to falling prices and legalisation around this point by the EU wide directives.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : Definite\r\n<h1><em>Age 37 : \u00a02030</em></h1>\n<h2>Everyone's an Engineer</h2>\r\nThe standard household now has a 3D printer capable of printing complex metal fixtures. This allows the fixing of nearly all household appliances by anyone. Worldwide consumer bodies start requiring companies to provide 3D images for specific parts for repairs.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : Fair chance\r\n<h1><em>Age 47 : \u00a02040</em></h1>\n<h2>Your not-so-Jetson Space holiday awaits</h2>\n<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Space1.bmp\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-22863 aligncenter\" alt=\"Space1\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Space1.bmp\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAt this point due to your solidifying professional life (ie. financial status) and crashing costs you start to plan your first space travel holiday. This will be like today, a short few hour trip into the edge of what can be considered our atmosphere more than space travel. However for the truly flush there is a newly set up space hotel that is really just a privately owned ISS. Private Space travel have overtaken government by this time.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : Almost definite\r\n<h1><em>Age 52 : \u00a02045</em></h1>\n<h2>Geo-Engineering begins in Earnest</h2>\r\nAs the First World Population approaches half the planet this puts a strain on world resources.\u00a0An international body like the UN starts large scale experimenting on controlling the earths temperature. Most likely with injecting chemicals into the atmosphere to control the atmospheres intake of light. There will be massive \"Temperature\" debates and worldwide controversy for the rest of your life over who can control the earths temperature. They will probably settle on something like the year 2000 AD as an arbitrary \"correct\" temperature.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : It's this or third world Armageddon\r\n<h1><em>Age 60 : \u00a02053</em></h1>\n<h2>Most computers are not only smarter than you, but more creative</h2>\r\nThis is actually the most unsure of the predictions by far. AI is the most uncontrollable prediction in our future. Whether we start to build AI's that not only mimic our functions, but can actually feel.\r\n\r\nIn pairing with this the first real militant AI rights groups start about now. Mimicking the acts of militant animal liberation groups of the 21st century.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : No one has a clue really\r\n<h1><em>Age 62 : \u00a02055</em></h1>\n<h2>The World fills out and smarts up</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">population maxes out at 9 - 10 Billion</blockquote>\r\nThe population of the world maxes out at 9 - 10 Billion around this time. It will not pass this point in your or your childrens' life time. Also by this time the vast majority of the world will have instant access to high quality computing and internet, even if it means they go hungry to pay for it.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : Excluding some major world disaster\r\n<h1><em>Age 70 : \u00a02063</em></h1>\n<h2>You buy your first humanoid home robot aide</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">Humanoid Robots being hacked in your home is rare</blockquote>\r\nOnly if you are infirm but humanoid robot companions are not only commonplace but very affordable. The only have a rudimentary for the time by regulation and them being hacked is rare but widely publicised in the tech scares of the sixties.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : Give or take 20 years\r\n<h1><em>Age 80 : \u00a02073</em></h1>\n<h2>Cheapo Avatar begins</h2>\r\nAfter years of private enterprise pushing into space both it and the government start harvesting asteroids for high grade metals. The process has been theorized for a century and goes smoothly first time. It'll eventually become the first port of call for all precious metals as asteroids are so mineral rich.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : It's this or massive technological collapse\r\n<h1><em>Age 90 : \u00a02083</em></h1>\n<h2>You do something unthinkable with a Whizzbang</h2>\r\nFuturism, while fun, is a dark art. The darkest part of which is the absence of knowledge of the spectacularly not invented. Not a bendable phone or a better computer. \u00a0Something unthinkable that would appear as magic to the ancient Luddites of 2014.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : Absolutely definite\r\n<h1><em>Age 100 : 2093</em></h1>\n<h2>You die, or do you?</h2>\r\nYou probably die roughly around this time unless a medical discovery greater than any other is made that helps partially cure old age. Maybe made by the now world dominating Health Company that is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/google-is-launching-a-company-that-hopes-to-cure-death-2013-9\">Google</a>.\r\n\r\nAccuracy : Tarot card stuff\r\n\r\nSo, how do you think we did? Or what do you think would change.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/evol.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22822", "Heading": "Your Life in Technological Revolutions"}
