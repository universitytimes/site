{"Body": "<strong>Owen Bennett</strong>\n<em>Editor</em>\n\nIt has emerged that the 'No' campaign team in the USI Referendum has been fined as a result of the content of an editorial published in a Trinity student newspaper yesterday. The SU Electoral Commission (EC) has ruled that a newspaper editorial in support of a particular side can be considered external sponsorship and as such is in violation of the referendum rules.\n\nThe 'No' campaign team has been forced to surrender five t-shirts for the duration of today's campaigning. Moreover, only one member of USI Officer Board will be allowed on campus to campaign today. <em>The University Times</em> understands that several USI sabbatical officers from around the country had booked into rented accommodation in the capital this week with the intention of campaigning heavily over the last few days of the referendum.\n\nThe fine by the EC results from an editorial printed by <em>Trinity News </em>yesterday. The editorial urged students to vote No in the USI referendum. The SU approved rules of the referendum state that 'campaign teams may not receieve sponsorship from any internal or external organisations'. Prior to the beginning of campaigning, both campaign teams agreed to the referendum rules, a set of rules which are based on the procedures and protocols for SU sabbatical elections.\n\nThe EC's interpretation of the referendum rules has drawn criticism from elements of the 'No' campaign as traditionally newspapers have often endorsed candidates and campaigns in a national and international context. Moreover, the newspaper in question is funded by Trinity Publications, a capitated body wholly independent of the SU and the Electoral Commission.\n\nIn an editorial published this lunchtime, TN has articulated a 'grave concern' over last night's EC ruling. The Editor, R\u00f3n\u00e1n Burtenshaw has has described the ruling as 'alarming'. The editorial went on to say that '<em>Trinity News</em> takes this decision very seriously and is considering all options available to us as a paper, and to our staff as members of the Trinity College Dublin Students&rsquo; Union.'\n\nSpeaking to <em>The University Times</em>, a spokesperson for the 'No' campaign said that the team\u00a0'respect(s) the most recent\u00a0decisions of the EC and will strive to remain in compliance with the\u00a0<em>ad hoc</em>\u00a0decisions that characterise their activites, insofar as they are binding pending appeal by the body to which the EC are accountable.'\n\nPolling in the USI Referendum closes tomorrow at 4pm. The result of the referendum is expected around 9pm tomorrow evening.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<div></div>\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "<strong>Owen Bennett</strong>\n<em>Editor</em>\n\nIt has emerged that the 'No' campaign team in the USI Referendum has been fined as a result of the content of an editorial published in a Trinity student newspaper yesterday.
