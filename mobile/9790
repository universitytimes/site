Why is an article on the Irish Universities Surfing Intervarsities not in the sports section of the UT?\n\nA. Surfing is not just a sport, it is a <em>raison d&rsquo;</em><em>\u0119tre</em> \u00a0- a clich\u00e9d way of life. The Surf Intervarsities this year ratified this mantra. Radical.\n\n1778; the year J.J. Rousseau died. It was also the year Captain Cook&rsquo;s third expedition took him to Hawai&rsquo;i (he called them the Sarnie Islands in honour of some &ldquo;lord&rdquo;&hellip; oh so original). Subsequently the first known report on surfing came into existence. Cook observed and recorded that &ldquo;a diversion most common is upon the water where there is very great sea, and surf breaking on the shore&hellip;\u00a0 the great art is to guide the plank [board] so as always to keep it in a proper direction on top of the swell&hellip;&rdquo; He concluded: &ldquo;The above diversion is only intended as an amusement, not a tyral of skill&hellip; they seem to feel a great pleasure in the motion which this exercise gives.&rdquo; I bet if Rousseau tried out a spot of surfing he would have taken great pleasure from it &ndash; Surfing Contract Theory anyone? It&rsquo;s a pity he was Swiss and the sea would have been tough to find &ndash; <em>Confessions </em>would have been so much more gnarly.\n\nThe 2012 Surf Inter-Varsities, held in the scenic &amp; serene Strandhill in Co. Sligo on\u00a0 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> of March, were second-to-none. I can safely say that all attendees of all institutions - whether they competed or not - had a remarkable time. Surfing (and all it entails) is synonymous to contentedness. The more one surfs the more one feels content. Fact.\n\nThe year at Strandhill there was frolicking and frivolity out of the water - whilst the amphibians amongst us did the same in the water.\n\nHowever if surfing is to be treated as a sport, or a &lsquo;tyral of skill&rsquo;, Trinity have a lot to claim. The TCD Surf Club came third this year. A great accomplishment considering that the colleges which finished first and second are both situated a stones-throw-away from the nearest swell. Bronze will do more than suffice.\n\nIt was truly a team effort. Though individuals must be mentioned.\n\nRuth Hunter battled the ferocious onshore winds and bitter, bitter cold to finish 2<sup>nd</sup> in the Female Longboard competition &ndash; a heroine if ever there was one. Ronan McGuire, &ldquo;business man&rdquo; of the year, thwarted his two other &ldquo;competitors&rdquo; on his barge of an SUP (Stand-Up-Paddleboard) to take the all glory of gold in his event &ndash; an expected win. Both Paddy Ryan and Freddie Honohan displayed radical manoeuvres on their bodyboards in their heats &ndash; both finishing 3<sup>rd</sup>. The judges did change their mind with Freddie&rsquo;s position &ndash; he was down as a qualifying second however they crossed it out and put third. They&rsquo;re reasoning? &ldquo;N.A.&rdquo;. Corrupt judges did nothing to perturb the Masters student &ndash; Freddie continued to bring-the-buzz to the trip after his event.\n\nThe Men&rsquo;s Open competitors faired okay (considering some of the competition was semi-pro / professional). Callum Swift (President of the Club) took a break from topping his tan to finish fifth in his heat. \u00a0Niall Rogers on the other hand &ndash; with the clubs hopes and dreams resting on his shoulders &ndash; chose to paddle about and splash around for twenty minutes instead; it was as &lsquo;alterno&rsquo; and as &lsquo;scenester&rsquo; as one could get. Respect.\n\nI can testify that the conditions were extremely tough. When one strolls down to the sea one can only be consumed by the extremely rational thought: &ldquo;What in Poseidon&rsquo;s name am I doing!?&rdquo; Imagine strolling into icey-cold water wearing a rubbery garment and holding a glass plank with walls of heavy grey water breaking in front of you. Then you have to start paddling through these walls. Ice-cream headache? Ben and Jerries can take a hike.\n\nHowever, never mind all of the physical surfing malarki. The post-surf (not as pretentiously French as apr\u010ds-ski) was where all the fun was had. A few comments from new club members surmise just how great-a-trip it was. Gary Beardsley, an extremely intelligent and amicable first-year engineering student said: &ldquo;It was sweet. It was intense. The weather was emotional but that didn&rsquo;t stop the gnarly times &ndash; everyone was there to get &lsquo;maoi-dy&rsquo; and shite. There were lads getting barrelled on the Friday when we arrived and I was watching them &ndash; it was gnarly. The locals were sweet and all too.&rdquo;\n\nHugh Macken, another first year erudite stated: &ldquo;I had a great time &ndash; I study Geography and I just love getting to know nature and all that craic. Some of the rocks on the beach were huge &ndash; but that didn&rsquo;t stop me throwing them around. There was fun to be had everywhere.&rdquo; Enthusiasm for surf-culture does not just exist in the water.\n\nStrandhill is an undeniably spiritual place. Old Ben Bulben watches over the sea &ndash; bringing in the swell. The swell transubstantiates into waves. The resulting running peaks of white (grey) gold are illuminated by the sun whilst the resident seals pop up intermittently. These scenes are only heightened by the relentless hospitality of the locals with their welcoming ways. TCD students were entirely respectful to their surroundings &ndash; no damage was done to any infrastructure or local environment. Surfers know Karma will get ya; skiers should take a leaf.\n\nSurfing is the fastest growing &ldquo;sport&rdquo; in Ireland. It should be considered a sport &ndash; but it should also be considered a way-of-life, a calling, a spiritual religion if you must. This year&rsquo;s trip was a great success all round for TCD. In a sporting sense the club exceeded expectations. In a <em>raison d&rsquo;</em><em>\u0119tre</em> sense it did more. The two aforementioned first-year students are now complete converts to the one true faith &ndash; the church of the ocean and the synagogue of the sea. Cook realised that surfing was more than just a competitive &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; back in the eighteenth century. In saying that, the way TCD Surf Club is progressing, next year a 1<sup>st</sup> place finish only will suffice.\n\nCome on the next trip to Lahinch ladies and gentlemen; H\u00e4agen-Dazs headaches are by-the-by.", "Imageurl": "9791", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "9790", "Heading": "TCD Surf Club: The Sea is not the limit"}
