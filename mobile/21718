{"Body": "<strong>Clementine Yost</strong>\u00a0| Online Magazine Editor\r\n\r\nA referendum on marriage equality has been scheduled for 2015, and long-time advocate of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender rights, the Union of\u00a0Students in Ireland (USI) is set to begin campaigning in the coming year. The USI hopes to\u00a0convince wary Irish voters that civil marriage should extend to gay and lesbian couples.\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">&ldquo;It is high time that Ireland\u00a0stopped talking about an equal society and started delivering on it.\"</blockquote>\r\nSince the 1970s, the USI has supported LGBT causes throughout Ireland. The campaign\u00a0for the decriminalization of homosexuality, one of the most notable LGBT campaigns in\u00a0Irish history, enjoyed USI support throughout the 1990s, especially in 1993 leading up to\u00a0the final ruling. In 2012, the USI Congress voted unanimously to mandate a supportive\u00a0stance on marriage equality from the union.\r\n\r\nThe decision to hold the referendum has prompted encouraging statements from Joe O&rsquo;Connor, President\u00a0of the USI. Recently, O&rsquo;Connor declared, &ldquo;USI will accept\u00a0nothing short of full marriage equality for LGBT citizens, and following the recent\u00a0announcements regarding a referendum in 2015, we will be campaigning heavily over\u00a0the coming year for this to be held and passed. This is an issue that students across\u00a0the country feel extremely strongly about, and we will be utilizing our new Student\u00a0Elector Registration Database (SERD) to mobilise students across the country for this\u00a0forthcoming referendum.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nWith a history of lobbying for LGBT rights, the USI intends to gather across-the-board support for what they hope will be a monumental campaign, perhaps one\u00a0of the largest social campaigns in years.\r\n\r\nO&rsquo;Connor further stated: &ldquo;It is high time that Ireland\u00a0stopped talking about an equal society and started delivering on it. Marriage equality\u00a0would be a fundamental step forward, and we would encourage all citizens to play their\u00a0part in making this a reality.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/DSC_1084.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21718", "Heading": "USI to Campaign in Marriage Equality Referendum"}
