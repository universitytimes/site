{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">The University Times has learned that the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) was warned by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na that the student protest taking place today may be at risk of hijacking by Republican activists.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The &ldquo;Fight For Your Future Now&rdquo; demonstration will take place on Molesworth Street, near the D\u00e1il, between 4 and 6pm and it is intended to protest the further cutting of the maintenance grant by the government in the upcoming Budget 2014.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking to UT, Paddy Guiney, Vice President for Campaigns of the USI, stated: &ldquo;As it&rsquo;s a public demonstration, anything is possible&hellip;[but] we are working very closely with the guards on the matter. We were made aware that a republican group would be attending the demonstration. However we will have officers there and a heavy garda presence. Safety has always been my main priority.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Asked which Republican group in particular would be attending the march, Guiney said, &ldquo;They are former members of different national groups - the same people who were involved in the demonstration outside the D\u00e1il [on September 18].&rdquo; On this occasion, roughly 500 people gathered outside Leinster House to protest austerity measures and violence broke out between protesters and Garda\u00ed, with three people arrested and three others brought to St James&rsquo; Hospital with injuries.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Guiney went on to advise participants: &ldquo;My advice for students participating would be: do make your voices heard, bring as many friends as possible, but of course be respectful at the same time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The demo is part of a series of protests taking place across the country today. In Cork, there will be a march from UCC into Cork City at 1pm, and in Sligo, students will march from Sligo IT to Stephen Street at 1:30pm. Dublin colleges, including Trinity, DIT, Blanchardstown IT, IADT and DCU will take part in the Molesworth St. event, along with Maynooth and Dundalk. Speakers will include TCDSU President Tom Lenihan and USI President Joe O&rsquo;Connor.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking to UT, Joe O&rsquo;Connor stated that: &ldquo;The last march was a few years ago, and there is a benefit to having one massive day of publicity, a show of unity among all students. Last year we had regional demonstrations, in an attempt to bring the issue back into the community&hellip;this year we&rsquo;re trying to combine the two.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On whether this approach can effectively influence government decisions, Tom Lenihan outlined: &ldquo;in previous years it hasn&rsquo;t worked&hellip;[but] I am confident that we could win on the grant issue. It&rsquo;s a highly sensitive issue, as if the grant is cut there will be a huge dropout rate. I am confident that if we put the right pressure on the government, this will work. It&rsquo;s a case of picking our fights and being more realistic. The grant issue is more up in the air; it&rsquo;s like the medical card issue, and decisions can be reversed.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Asked what the USI&rsquo;s response will be if student grants are further cut in the budget, O&rsquo;Connor maintained that: &ldquo;At the moment we&rsquo;re more focused on winning the battle &ndash; we don&rsquo;t want to have to be in the position where we have to respond.&rdquo; Lenihan stated that if grants are cut, an emergency USI National Council meeting will be called for the day after the Budget and a Plan B will be discussed. While at the moment there have been no detailed talks of such a plan as it is believed that this would foster a negative attitude among students, Lenihan said: &ldquo;I would imagine that the USI and ourselves would be militant; we would be looking for direct action.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lenihan went on to say, &ldquo;I would encourage everyone to come along [today] even if you&rsquo;re not political, just to show that you do have a voice, you do care.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Photo Credits: Andrew Murphy</em></p>\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/andrewmurphy.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19847", "Heading": "Warning of Possible Republican Presence at USI Demonstration"}
