If these other programs to increase education amongst the disadvantaged are working, why do they require free fees for everyone? After all, there are certainly students who can afford to pay.

Liquidity constraints may be a problem, although this is not immediately obvious. Without huge state spending on education, there&rsquo;s a lot more money to go around.
