The quality review was carried out between the 15th and 17th of May 2012 by representatives from the University of Warwick, Loughborough University among other Irish-based reviewers, facilitated by Trinity&rsquo;s Anne Fitzgerald.\n\nThe above recommendation is among 35 contained within a 38 page document circulated at a university board meeting on October 10th last year. Submissions made at this meeting included that students should not have to pay for a helpdesk service and that &ldquo;the IS Services Helpdesk is a valuable service to the College and should not be outsourced.&rdquo; The recommendation had been included in the report as a cure to &ldquo;inconsistent and confusing&rdquo; opening hours of the &ldquo;highly valued&rdquo; service. Outsourcing of such services has been of benefit to other institutions such as the University of Warwick but would likely come with at a cost for students.\n\nTrinity College Chief Operating Officer Darina Kneafsey advised the board at the meeting that the report &ldquo;is extensive and detailed and takes into account the level of skills available within the College and the legacy issues because of a failure to invest in systems in the past.&rdquo;\n\nAlso laid out are plans for the hiring of a Chief Information Officer (CIO) for college to be the &ldquo;architect of and hold accountability for the delivery of College&rsquo;s Information Strategy&rdquo;. Board minutes indicate that students will likely be involved in the development of this strategy and that the hiring of a CIO should precede the implementation of the strategy &ldquo;in order that he/she may contribute to the process.&rdquo; The minutes also suggest that college &ldquo;should consider whether IS Services has the correct skill set to deliver the IT strategy once developed.&rdquo;\n\nThe report acknowledges that college&rsquo;s wireless service is an area of concern for both users and ISS, particularly as far as mobile devices are concerned. Since the review was carried out last May, iOS software, used in iPhones and iPads has been made compatible with the College wireless network though users of the Android platform are still unable to connect. The recommendation says that the &ldquo;existing mechanisms for wired and wireless networking were considered cumbersome and unreliable. IS Services should continue to consult with other higher education institutions to consider if alternative mechanisms and approaches might be usefully applied to TCD.&rdquo; Board minutes indicate that it is not the intention of the board to pass on the cost of wireless connectivity in college to students.\n\nExpanded support for Mac users to reflect growing numbers of students using Apple products was recommended as well as the harmonisation of the two different email systems used in college for students and staff. There is also the recommendation to outsource printing services though the concern is expressed that this may lead to a &ldquo;perception of IS Services &lsquo;pushing away&rsquo; users to a third party provider and, to some extent, washing its hands of the relationship.&rdquo; It is therefore concluded that though external vendors have many positive contributions to make, &ldquo;it is critical that IS Servies remain the public face of the service and hold total responsibility for its performance.&rdquo;\n\nA number of students consulted as part of the report, meanwhile, admitted that it is not always apparent who should be contacted for support in the first instance.\n\nIS Services employs 86 (77 full-time equivalents) staff members across four buildings, 200 Pearse St housing the most. It is responsible for the planning, delivery and support of Trinity&rsquo;s main computing facilities, and supports 25,000 users on campus as well as in St James&rsquo;s and Tallaght Hospitals. IS Services supplies IT training and provides support in lecture theatres and seminar rooms.", "Imageurl": "15194", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15193", "Heading": "College Shelves Recommendation for IS Services Helpdesk Charge"}
