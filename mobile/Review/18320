Yet it manages to have country undertones and soulful lyrics at the same time.\u00a0 Ronan Power&rsquo;s raspy singing voice proves to be quite alluring.\u00a0\u00a0He demonstrates his versatility when he unleashes a powerful, yet not quite eardrum-splitting yell in the chorus. One might find it reminiscent of Nickelback, in a good way.\u00a0 A twang of Lady Antebellum is present as the song unfolds.\u00a0\u00a0The listener is drawn in by declarations about isolation and self-discovery:</span><i style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&ldquo;I fall before an empty face.\u00a0 I crawl away to outer space, who am I?&rdquo;</i><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">\u00a0 The song begins by alluding to more commercially successful rock music, with noticeable similarities to Red Hot Chili Peppers, Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam and Nirvana.\u00a0 Jemson Green attempts to break this mould by according themselves a somewhat punky hipster style.\u00a0 What&rsquo;s not to like?\u00a0 They&rsquo;re emotive, endearing and when you watch the video, charmingly attractive.\u00a0 If you haven&rsquo;t already gathered, they are also talented.\u00a0 Three-quarters of the way through the song, drummer Shaun Costello lets loose in an excitingly fast-paced solo.\u00a0 This is fun, charming and a tad on the wild side.\u00a0 Jemson Green know how to entertain.</span>\r\n\r\nThe video for\u00a0<i>Who Am I</i>, shot and directed by Jono Lavery was released 26<sup>th</sup>\u00a0August just in time to get people excited for their upcoming tour.\u00a0 The video was shot in colour, yet with low saturation, giving an effect reminiscent of early music videos.\u00a0 The set is extremely bare, with exposed rafters and plumbing lines giving a skeletal effect.\r\n\r\nJemson Green bassist, Bambi, head bangs his dreads like an Irish Jimmi Hendrix. The individualism of Jemson Green contributes enormously to their appeal.\u00a0 They are not rocking out in some sort of\u00a0<i>we must head bang and strum because we are a rock band\u00a0</i>kind of way.\u00a0 They are their own thing.\u00a0In this video they have created a mood, an aura of confusion and intrigue. And they deliver it with intense lyrics and talented artistry.\r\n\r\nNeed anyone be reminded; they have more up their sleeves than one catchy tune.\u00a0 Jemson Green&rsquo;s debut single\u00a0<i>Growing Stranger</i>, gained them a cult following across Ireland and the UK and was lauded,\u00a0<i>&ldquo;as compelling and irresistible a rocker you&rsquo;ll hear all year&rdquo;</i>\u00a0by Hotpress in January 2012. This act is definitely one to watch.", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Jemson-Green-l-r-Conor-Shaun-Ronan-Bambi-Shane-\u0160-Meghan-ODowd-2013-21.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18320", "Heading": "Jemson Green &lsquo;Who Am I&rsquo; single and video release"}
