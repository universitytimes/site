{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Michelle O'Connor</strong> | Chief Copy Editor</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I am a gluten-free diner, I tend not to get enthused when my mates go, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying out somewhere new, stall.&rdquo; I generally agree to go, and ensure I have a snack in my bag incase the options are paltry. I looked at going to Bunsen on Wexford St with a pinch of salt (pun very much intended).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I walked in, I was sold. I was sold by the exceptionally basic and cute business cards on every table, which is actually the menu. With options so few that they fit on a business card, I was shocked to see &ldquo;Gluten-free/Paleo options&rdquo; at the end.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I ordered, obviously, the gluten-free cheeseburger.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In my previous experience, as anyone with a gluten-intolerance will know; gluten-free bread/pizza/burger buns are generally lacking. In everything: taste, texture, edibility, etc. You name it, they don&rsquo;t have it. They tend to be either cardboard like, or soft to the extent that they crumble as soon as you attempt to lift it up to bite.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My gluten-free burger arrived and - my god - it was so good. The burger itself is enough, but when as a celiac, you actually come across a gluten-free burger that isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;in a bowl&rdquo; or &ldquo;naked&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s an event; well for me, anyway.</p>\r\nThe burger itself was so fresh it was unbelievable. A big ol&rsquo; hunk of meat with all the freshest garnishes. Even the pickle was nice. That&rsquo;s saying something. I was stuffed three quarters of the way through the burger, and was so glad I shared a sweet potato fries because otherwise I think I may have rolled out of there.\r\n\r\nWhile GBK has the upperhand catering for vegetarians, Bunsen is a burger lovers paradise. Simple yet tasty to the extreme. I will definitely be back.\r\n\r\nThe interior and the way the burger is served is minimalistic and therefore you&rsquo;re not distracted by gimmicks. Plus, the smaller the menu, the better the quality. Kitchens can&rsquo;t actually handle large menus and when they do that means they&rsquo;re cutting corners somewhere.\r\n\r\nGo, eat and treat yourself every once in a while. The walk there and back will do you good.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/960972_10151935215184417_1914549400_n.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20881", "Heading": "Review: Bunsen"}
