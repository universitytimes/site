The beleaguered singer-songwriter&rsquo;s day to day life consists of borrowing money, sleeping on couches, playing the same old venue and trying to attract record producers. With this, their sixteenth feature film, the Coen brothers follow up the modern classic True Grit with another perfectly pitched and brilliantly acted slice of Americana.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">Davis is a world-weary character who lives only for his music, even at the expense of relationships with family and friends</blockquote>\r\nOscar Isaac steps up to the plate in the title role after a string of strong supporting performances in films like Robin Hood, The Bourne Legacy and Drive. \u00a0He has a difficult task, not least because of the singing, which he more than manages. \u00a0Davis is a world-weary character who lives only for his music, even at the expense of relationships with family and friends. \u00a0It&rsquo;s not so much ambition that drives him, he just doesn&rsquo;t belong anywhere else.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Inside-Llewyn-Davis.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"Inside-Llewyn-Davis\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Inside-Llewyn-Davis.jpg\" width=\"770\" height=\"513\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The film follows Llewyn as he wanders aimlessly from New York to Chicago and back again with few goals and little success. \u00a0The plot is equally directionless, although this is obviously intentional. \u00a0Whole sections could be removed without affecting the narrative but it&rsquo;s these tangential encounters with unusual people that form much of the films backbone. \u00a0To criticize Inside Llewyn Davis for its lack of plot is to miss the point entirely.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">To criticize Inside Llewyn Davis for its lack of plot is to miss the point entirely</blockquote>\r\nStory is not the priority here, rather, the film exists to allow the Coens to meditate beautifully on their love of this music and the brilliantly realized world in which it was created. \u00a0The soundtrack by T Bone Burnett features Bob Dylan and Marcus Mumford tracks, along with original material. \u00a0The Auld Triangle even gets a look in, and a scene where Llewyn performs the hilarious novelty song &ldquo;Please Mr. Kennedy&rdquo; is a highlight\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The film has an exceptional supporting cast. \u00a0Isaac is joined by his Drive co-star Carey Mulligan, who previously proved her singing chops in Shame. \u00a0Justin Timberlake shows more acting ability here than his previous work would suggest. Coen regular John Goodman also makes a small but typically memorable appearance along with F. Murray Abraham and a host of other recognizable faces.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/inside_llewyn_davis-e1390816795544.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"inside_llewyn_davis\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/inside_llewyn_davis-1024x576.jpg\" width=\"980\" height=\"551\" /></a></strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is understated filmmaking by the brothers from Minnesota. The histrionics of Raising Arizona and Burn After Reading are nowhere to be seen. Gone too is the violence and convoluted plot twists of Fargo. That&rsquo;s not to say that the film doesn&rsquo;t have the brothers&rsquo; fingerprints all over it. \u00a0Their black sense of humor remains, albeit toned down significantly and as a result Inside Llewyn Davis is possibly their warmest film, with cinematography from Bruno Delbonnel that literally glows.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The real winner here is Oscar Isaac in his first major lead role. \u00a0If the acting doesn&rsquo;t work out for him he could definitely pursue a musical career, that is, if he doesn&rsquo;t mind mooching off friends and couch-hopping for the rest of his life.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/inside-llewyn-davis-8.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23333", "Heading": "Inside Llewyn Davis"}
