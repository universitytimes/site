Really energetic and exciting.\" The band's self-titled debut earned them nominations for two Brit Awards and the Mercury Prize, awarded each year for the best album from the UK or Ireland.\n\nRivalling Friendly Fires for the title of headline act is Professor Green, described by O'Connor as \"the biggest name in British hip-hop\". Professor Green returns after playing the ball last year.\n\n\"He's come a long way since then so I can't wait to see what he has in store\" continued O'Connor. Specifically, the last year has seen him reach No. 2 in the Irish Charts with his single 'Read All About It'. However, he went one better in his homeland to occupy the top spot for two weeks. This followed his 2010 collaborations with Lily Allen and Ed Drewett that reached no. 5 and no. 3 respectively.\n\nEnglish singer-songwriter Labrinth first grabbed the headlines in 2009 when he became Simon Cowell's first non-talent show signing in six years. His 2010 collaboration with Tinie Tempah 'Pass Out' reached the top of the UK Charts while his October solo effort 'Earthquake', described by O'Connor as \"one of the biggest songs of the year\", climbed to no. 2. Labrinth performs this year having worked as a writer or producer with the likes of Pixie Lott, Gorillaz, and fellow Trinity Ball performer Professor Green.\n\nWelsh singer Marina Lambrini Diamandis, known by her stage name of Marina and the Diamonds, will play the Ball a matter of weeks before the launch of her second album 'Electra Heart' following her d\u00e9but 'The Family Jules' which settled in the top ten both here and in the UK. \"Besides being incredible vocally she has an edge to her style which is unique\" said O'Connor, singling her out as one of the most exciting acts on an illustrious bill.\n\nO'Connor highlighted Brighton duo Rizzle Kicks as one of the acts playing the Ball whose performance he most anticipates, calling them \"one of the most exciting young talents to break in 2011/2012.\" Fans have, in the past interpreted the lyrics of Rizzle Kicks' top ten single 'Down with the Trumpets' literally, flinging their underwear onto the stage. This being the Trinity Ball, it seems difficult to rule out a repeat! O'Connor claims that it was that very song that made him determined to book this act so Trinity Ball security can consider themselves warned to look out for for a partially-clad Ents Officer.\n\nDJs TEED, Enrol Alkan, and Fake Blood enhance an English contingent that also includes Dot Rotten, nominated in December for BBC's Sound of 2012 award, previous winners of which include 50 Cent, Jessie J and Adele. London's The Milk, best known for their single '(All I wanted Was) Danger', complete the overseas line-up.\n\n30 year old Ryan Sheridan arguably leads an Irish bill that also includes The Kanyu Tree, currently up for a Meteor Award for their song 'Radio', and The Original Rude Boys who gained critical acclaim with last year's single 'Stars in their Eyes'. Monaghan-born Sheridan's past audiences include President Barack Obama, while his recent charity recording of the Christmas classic 'Walking in the Air' surged to the top of the Irish itunes charts. Sheridan joins past Oxegen-performers Consumer Love Affair and Belfast bands Cashier No. 9 (referred to by the BBC as a \"staggering, non-chalant talent\") and The Dead Presidents, who complete the home-grown bill.\n\nTrinity College will be represented on stage both by the winners of Trinity's Battle of the Bands, and by Trinity Orchestra who O'Connor believes \"will add to the atmosphere in a great way, in one way taking it back to what the ball used to be.\"\n\nThe bill doubtlessly contains a host of big names and O'Connor is delighted with the final list. \"I think this year really has something for everyone and the acts on the bill are huge already if not on the cusp of being massive in the coming months\", he noted before ending by saying: \"To sum it all up, I'm dangerously excited about this years Trinity Ball line-up!\"\n\n<em>Tickets for Trinity Ball 2012 go on sale this Wednesday priced &euro;80.</em>", "Imageurl": "8591", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8590", "Heading": "Friendly Fires to headline the Trinity Ball"}
