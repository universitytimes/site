Having whimpered their way to defeat against the Dutch champions midweek, Man City&rsquo;s increasingly forlorn-looking manager must be coming to a realization. For every Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri he can buy &ndash; there are certain things in life that simply can&rsquo;t be bought.\n\nMan City are champions of England. Considering Mancini is in charge of the highest paid, most expensive group of players in English football history, well, they&rsquo;d bloody well want to be champions of something. It was a trophy that was very nearly squandered on multiple occasions and despite summer reinforcements in the form of Jack Rodwell, Javi Garcia and Maicon, City&rsquo;s grip seems loser than ever. And Roberto Mancini, pacing the touchline on Wednesday like a dead man walking, knows exactly why.\n\nThere is no dearth of quality in the squad assembled by Mancini (and very partially Mark Hughes), but when a side of such immense talent stumbles to the least convincing Premiership win ever, something is amiss. And if there&rsquo;s anything we&rsquo;ve learned from Manchester United&rsquo;s continued dominance of the Premier League, it&rsquo;s not always talent that wins you titles. It&rsquo;s a mentality, it&rsquo;s a desire, it&rsquo;s an <em>attitude</em>. And while there&rsquo;s no more of a dearth in attitude than there is in quality at the Etihad Stadium, by no means is that a good thing.\n\nJust after City&rsquo;s defeat on Wednesday to a team whose European pedigree has fallen rather drastically over the past decade, defender Micah Richards took to the press to air out some perceived flaws with Mancini&rsquo;s demands. He accused Mancini of playing the defenders in a system that did not suit them, and Richards claimed the players were uncomfortable with the formation.\u00a0 Nobody needs reminding that Mancini&rsquo;s managerial honours include three Serie A titles in four seasons at Inter Milan. Nobody except the City players, it would seem. Mancini encountered\u00a0 a similar dispute last year when Carlos Tevez refused to take the field against Bayern Munich &ndash; the Argentine striker has given varied excuses for his behaviour that night but it&rsquo;s hard for your average football fan to look beyond\u00a0 the petulant nature of a football who wasn&rsquo;t happy to start a big game on the bench. Top of Mancini&rsquo;s shopping list of things that money can&rsquo;t buy? One word, etched into the paper, emboldened over and over: respect. It eludes Mancini with more evasiveness than a Champions League title.\n\nThere are many out there who question Mancini&rsquo;s credentials, often the same people who talk of managers like Harry Redknapp and David Moyes as miracle workers. It&rsquo;s a misguided kind of questioning. A manager cannot be blamed for every attitude problem in his squad. If players are to hold such power over contract negotiations and whether or not they stay at a club anymore, they should be prepared to expect responsibility for their performances from fans and press alike. When David Silva angled his way into a new contract worth \u014130,000,000, he must have been licking his lips with glee, perhaps even more now that his formed has dipped severely and yet his manager&rsquo;s tactics and backbone are the things that get put under the microscope. And what of Mario Balotelli? Football&rsquo;s idiot-savant who performs once every blue moon (perhaps fittingly for a City player). Is Mancini a genius when Balotelli shines and a fool when he stutters? He is neither. Balotelli is a grown man, one blessed with incredible footballing ability, whose job is to put the ball in the goal. If he can&rsquo;t do that, it falls on his shoulders and his shoulders alone.\n\nThe role of a manager has become contorted in recent years, made to look glamorous by attention-hogging Mourinhos and brooding, romantic Guardiolas. The dugout is rarely occupied by a visionary, simply a man who knows his football &ndash; something that cannot be denied about Roberto Mancini. It is not his job to play a father figure to Mario Balotelli, or to treat Carlos Tevez and his wife to couple&rsquo;s counselling. The role of a manager is rather straightforward: win. Roberto Mancini has proven he can fine-tune a team to do just that, but worse than ever, inflated prices, inflated wallets and inflated egos are getting in the way. And it&rsquo;s about time that we, as fans, turn our attention from the dugout back onto the pitch.", "Imageurl": "13110", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13109", "Heading": "Blue Moon Setting On Mancini?"}
