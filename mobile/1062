{"Body": "<div>\n<div>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">The Trinity Junior Freshmen came off  the worse against a very strong UCD team in the first soccer Colours  match of the New Year. The UCD team relied on two second half goals  from two of their scholarship beneficiaries to secure a comfortable  3-0 win.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">UCD started the game the stronger with  Kevin Dunne and Darren Muldonney both threatening from wide areas. Stiofan  Sexton produced a good save from Trinity keeper Thomas Foster, after  Dunne squared the ball following a good run. UCD continued to pressure  the Trinity back four as the half developed, with centre forward Alan  Sutton using his strength and speed to create problems.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">The fortunate breakthrough for UCD  came after a Muldonney corner was only half-cleared and volleyed superbly  home by UCD captain Tomas O&rsquo;Briain, after Foster couldn&rsquo;t keep the  ball out. It was a lead that UCD fully deserved.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">Trinity continued to battle and eventually  began to control proceedings as the first half continued. Steven Killeen  played forward Dermot O&rsquo;Sullivan in behind the UCD defence who forced  a good save from UCD goalkeeper, Eric Barber. Killeen himself came close  towards the end of a second half after just failing to latch on to a  Faher Patil cross.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">Neither team was really able to gain  a foothold in the second half for long periods, as the rapid UCD counter-attacking  kept the Trinity midfield from flowing forward in numbers. Trinity&rsquo;s  best chance came 10 minutes after the restart when Patil played Gus  Stewart in who swivelled on the ball and forced a fantastic save from  Barber in goal.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">As they began to throw more men forward  in order to equalize, gaps began to appear in the Trinity defence. UCD  came close to capitalizing on these opportunities when Dunne and Sexton  combined to force a fantastic double-save from Foster.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">It continued to get worse for Trinity  as, after another attack had broken down, UCD midfielder Niall Hanley  carried the ball from the half-way line and smashed home from 30 yards.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">A two goal deficit meant Trinity gambled  by piling bodies forward towards the end of the game. But with the UCD  subs wanting to make a big impression, Syed Ogunfora slid the ball through  to Tristan Dent who calmly slid the ball home past Foster to wrap up  a 3-0 win.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">TCD coach John Hudson was pleased with  the performance, considering the limited amount of time the squad has  spent together. &ldquo;It was a big step up for the lads today.&rdquo; said  Hudson &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had a lot of time playing together, and we came  up against a good side who scored a couple of wonder goals. We were  unlucky not to benefit from the good period we had towards the end of  the first half.&rdquo; The Soccer Freshmen will hope to erase this loss  with a good performance in the Hanley cup next week in Maynooth. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">Matthew Rye - Deputy Sports Editor\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\"> </span>\n</div>\n</div>", "Imageurl": "1063", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1062", "Heading": "UCD ease home at College Park"}
