The crowd gathered in Front Square to join USI delegates and other organisations before joining the march from City Hall on Dame Street to the Department of Justice.\n\nLast year the march is said to have attracted 5,000 people; however, a Garda official told <em>The University Times </em>that there was an estimate of 2,000 marching today.\n\nSpeakers called for increased pressure to be placed on the government to hold a referendum on gay marriage. They also highlighted various issues for LGBT people in Ireland today such as bullying, prejudice and incidents of violence.\n\nLGBT Noise said today that the aim of the march is also to highlight the &ldquo;other human rights issues facing LGBT people more widely, in particular the serious danger facing LGBT people in Russia currently&rdquo;.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17462\" alt=\"DSC_0233\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0233-1024x678.jpg\" width=\"610\" height=\"403\" />\n\nVladamir Dotsenko, a Russian national working in Ireland, said the &ldquo;silence of political leaders on this issue is highly disturbing&rdquo;.\n\n&ldquo;We must demand that these leaders break their silence on the issue and come out against human rights violations in Russia in the strongest possible terms, as the more concern we as a society show, the better,&rdquo; he said.\n\nTCDSU Welfare Officer, Stephen Garry, said that \"we were delighted to see such a strong turnout of TCD students for one of the most important equality campaigns of our generation. We're looking forward to working with Q-Soc on this particular issue over the coming year and hopefully we will have the opportunity to run a referendum campaign in the near future.\"\n\nLaura Harmon, Vice President for Equality and Citizenship for USI, said that 'USI has a unanimous mandate to support marriage equality. This is an issue we are committed to campaigning on. Registering and mobilising students to vote in a referendum will be key campaign for USI this year. This is one of the most important civil rights issues of our generation. We were delighted with the turn out from students at today's march.''\n<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0200.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17450\" alt=\"DSC_0200\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0200-1024x678.jpg\" width=\"610\" height=\"403\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC_0208.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "17442", "Heading": "Students March For Marriage Equality"}
