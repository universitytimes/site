It has also opened up our minds again to be more creative with our recreational pursuits &ndash; gone are the days of simply shelling out money and credit we never really had on over-priced and often over-rated material goods.\u00a0 No more weekend jaunts to New York for a splurge!\n\nAcross the island we have seen more and more craft fairs, farmer&rsquo;s markets, local co-operatives and a massive effort to support and save small and family run businesses. Knitting, crocheting, painting, sculpting, baking and growing are all back in fashion with circles like the &ldquo;Stitch &lsquo;n&rsquo; Bitch&rdquo; groups sprouting up in all manner of spaces and places; and it&rsquo;s not just women who are getting out their needles and wool\n\nAs an oil painter and handmade greetings cards maker as well as Library Assistant in Trinity College Dublin I find my hobbies most rewarding and therapeutic, good for my health and better for my wealth. I got into making cards when I realised I\u00a0couldn't\u00a0buy a suitable one for my politically minded, atheist, emotionally intelligent friends. So now I make cards with Marx, Malcolm X, Swift, Connolly, Annie Besant and more quotes or images and all my friends love them. I also paint similar subjects.\n\nAs the first recession budget loomed and we were gripped with the fear with the help of some library colleagues I created the Trinity Winter Fayre, which is a craft fair show-casing college staff and student talent.\n\nFriday November 23<sup>rd</sup> will be the 4<sup>th</sup> year running the Fayre and I&rsquo;m proud to say it has grown into something quite special and memorable. Every year we make a massive donation to St.Andrews&rsquo; Resource Centre, Pearse Street from a percentage of the profits and this year donations will also be made to Our Lady&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Hospital Crumlin, Unicef, St. Vincent de Paul and others.\u00a0 It&rsquo;s a great day designed to be a morale boost, showcase handmade, Irish and definitely local creations.\n\nIt starts at 10am till 4pm, it&rsquo;s free entry and it&rsquo;s in The Atrium (beneath the Dining Hall/Buttery), by Front Square. So when you&rsquo;re lunching in the dining hall or grabbing a coffee in the buttery why not pop in and share the magic.\n\nBuying Irish, buying local and buying handmade is not just trendy it is also a political statement that says we are proud, we are skilled and we are sustainable.\n\nAs one of the greatest champions for the Arts &amp; Craft movement and a figure in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century British social change movement William Morris one said, &ldquo;Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful&rdquo;. Why not make that your mantra this Christmas?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>You can check out the details for the fayre by clicking <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TrinityWinterFayre.\">here\u00a0</a></em>\n<em>\u00a0</em>\n</div>", "Imageurl": "13055", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/christmas-craft3", "ID": "13054", "Heading": "Christmas Is Coming: Trinity Winter Fayre Announced"}
