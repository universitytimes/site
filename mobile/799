While some individual measures will have severe consequences for particular students, education as a whole seems to have been spared from the worst cuts.

This will effect only the first child in a family, with any subsequent children continuing to pay at the older rate of &euro;1500. The surprise move came about as a result of demands from Kerry South TD Jackie Healy-Rae, who sought support for local projects and spending on electorally sensitive programmes.

More significantly, in order to qualify for the higher &ldquo;non-adjacent&rdquo; level of grant, a student&rsquo;s place of residence must now be 45km away from their institution of study instead of 24km.
