{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hannah Ryan</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>News Staff</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The University Times</em> has learned that the Central Societies Committee (CSC) executive committee has voted to move the Dublin University Science Fiction Society out of its allocated room in House 6 to a room shared with DU Gamers Society in the Arches in Goldsmith Hall.</p>\nThe decision was reportedly announced by Ronan Hodson, honorary treasurer of the CSC, at a recent meeting of the executive committee. The official reason given is that the society are not making full use of such a large space - the biggest society space in House 6 - and that the ever-growing number of recognised societies dictates that no society can justify having a room for its exclusive occupation.\n\nThe decision to move the society from its current location was made on Wednesday 14th November, but the society was not informed of the decision for a further 26 hours, by which stage <em>The University Times</em> was already aware of the outcome of the meeting.\n\nSpeaking to <em>The University Times</em>, a Sci-Fi Society source has said that this decision has &lsquo;long been in the making&rsquo; and expressed the society committee&rsquo;s collective suspicion that the room was being earmarked for Q Soc in their stead. This suspicion, said the spokesperson, is based on Hodson and CSC secretary David Doyle&rsquo;s shared affiliation to Q Soc. Doyle held the position of auditor in the most recent academic year and Hodson held the same position in his days as a student. The spokesperson also questioned whether or not quorum was reached at the meeting of the executive. Doyle denied both of those suggestions when speaking to <em>The University Times</em> on Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe society have claimed that the decision was announced by Hodson at the end of the meeting. The position of honorary treasurer is non-voting and does not imbue the holder with decision-making authority.\n\nSci-Fi committee members approached the CSC on Friday to request a copy of the minutes of the meeting but that request was denied on the basis that sensitive information had been relayed in another part of the meeting. A further request for the minutes of the relevant section of the meeting only was also denied.\n\n<em>A University Times</em> source indicated that this was indeed the case, but Doyle stated that the decision was that of the executive and that quorum was in fact reached at the meeting: &ldquo;it was an exec decision&hellip;exec voted on it.&rdquo;\n\nWhen questioned about the suggestion that Q Soc would replace Sci-Fi in the room, he said that &ldquo;the list of who&rsquo;s moving in hasn&rsquo;t been decided yet&hellip;all this movement is part of a larger movement of all societies. This was the decision that the exec felt was best for societies in general.&rdquo;\n\nA member of the DU Gamers Society committee, who would be sharing its space with Sci-Fi if the move goes ahead, have expressed concerns to The University Times that there is no room for another society in their room in Goldsmith Hall. Doyle refuted this claim, stating: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been assessed by the CSC exec and it&rsquo;s felt that there is definitely room for both societies.&rdquo;\n\nWhen asked about the subject, and the prospect of several societies being moved in to share Sci Fi&rsquo;s room, Sam Heavey, treasurer of the society, stated emphatically that &ldquo;I am not happy with the decisions&hellip; the logic, we believe, is unsound. We have addressed our concerns with the CSC, but they refused to acknowledge it. We may have a chance as they did say we can write a proposal and officially submit it to them.\n\n&ldquo;Our proposal is simply to move some other societies into the room with us that have already agreed to it, if the CSC allows.&rdquo;\n\nAsked if he thought the move to be a form of punishment for the society&rsquo;s unsatisfactory accounts for 2011/12 and poor security of its room that led to &euro;1,000 being stolen during broad daylight, Heavey said &ldquo;I do not believe that we are being punished. They claim to have had plans to move societies, although it possibly put us in the spotlight.&rdquo;\n<div></div>", "Imageurl": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Hannah Ryan</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>News Staff</em></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The University Times</em> has learned that the Central Societies Committee (CSC) executive committee has voted to move the Dublin University Science Fiction Society out of its allocated room in House 6 to a room shared with DU Gamers Society in the Arches in Goldsmith Hall.</p>\nThe decision was reportedly announced by Ronan Hodson, honorary treasurer of the CSC, at a recent meeting of the executive committee.
