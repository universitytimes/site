Malone turned a period of pressure on their line into points when McGillan intercepted a wayward pass and ran seventy metres in to make it 17-3.\u00a0 Trinity finally sprang into life after this. Paddy Lavelle made one of his typically abrasive carries up the middle before offloading to David Fanagan.\u00a0 Fanagan produced a lovely arcing pass off his left hand to Niyi Adelokun who raced down the touchline from thirty metres out. His weaving run saw him skate clear of any defenders, finally getting Trinity off the mark and out of bed.\n\nMoore was back on for Malone and his heaving run off the kickoff brought Malone back downfield where they scored a very controversial try that brought much derision from DUFC&rsquo;s infamously vocal and boisterous &lsquo;Firm&rsquo;.\u00a0 Josh Pentland ran laterally and threw what looked a forward pass to McGillan.\u00a0 McGillan then appeared to fumble the ball forward with neither the referee or the linesman picking it up, before he gathered and slid over.\u00a0 His conversion from the touchline made it 24-10 at half time. Trinity went into the huddle somewhat shell-shocked in seeing how decisively and swiftly Malone had unraveled them.\n\nAt half time Paddy Carroll and Pierce Dargan came on for Warren Larkin and Alan McDonald and their impact was telling.\u00a0 Carroll in particular might not cut a typical picture of a front row forward with his blonde locks and washboard stomach but his strength and determination matched with his boundless energy makes him more than a match for any opponent hooker.\u00a0 Dargan likewise was electric, displaying hunger and ferocity in his play and his ability in the lineout played a crucial role in the second half for the students.\n\nMalone started the second half much in the manner they ended the first but following spilt possession McLoughlin put a long clearance kick down the park.\u00a0 Max Waters turned over the resulting lineout and from there Marsh fed Lavelle who carried straight up the middle before stepping late and popping the ball to Dargan.\u00a0 Dargan then stepped off his left foot and cut infield barreling through Taylor Acheson&rsquo;s tackle to make it 15-24.\u00a0 Trinity now began to play much more like their usual selves and with Malone ratcheting up a penalty count against them, Marsh made it 18-24 following Alan O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s failure to release.\n\nTrinity realizing the game was back in their grasp were guilty of playing too frantically and without accuracy or shape.\u00a0 One moment that had Tony Smeeth pulling his hair out was a passage of play following a turnover in the Trinity twenty-two that saw Brian Du Toit break free only for his pass to go astray giving Malone a scrum.\u00a0 However, Trinity continued to defend with excellent integrity never shooting up and trusting the system that has rewarded them time after time. When Marsh got a chance to kick after Malone went offside he was accurate as ever. With fifteen minutes to go it was 21-24 in favour of Malone. Marsh is perhaps known from his school days as a breaking and running outhalf but his kicking game is just as complete and effective.\u00a0 He continually probed in behind the Malone back three forcing them to run back and collect kicks making their shape go awry.\n\nOne of these kicks saw Acheson under pressure and his poor clearance went to the middle of the park.\u00a0 From it Marsh fed Ariel Robles who swerved in and out before being tackled.\u00a0 Then McLoughlin made another brilliant snipe catching Malone&rsquo;s ruck defence unawares and then unsure.\u00a0 Their hesitation was punished when he sent a gliding pass to Du Toit who ran in unopposed to make it 26-24.\u00a0 Marsh did brilliantly with the tricky touchline conversion giving DUFC a crucial four-point cushion.\n\nTrinity began an endless period of defence, somewhat unable to maintain composure and shut the game out.\u00a0 Hanratty worked like a Spartan chasing kick after kick forcing errors from his opposite number.\u00a0 Even when Trinity got possession back they failed to close up shop and with only a minute left Joyce led a desperate raid out of the Malone red-zone and fed Moore.\u00a0 Moore the ex-Ulster 21&rsquo;s back-row was one on one with Dave Fanagan.\u00a0 Moore upon viewing the slight fullback must have thought he was surely in but Fanagan is one of the bravest and most committed players on this Trinity side.\u00a0 He dove like an Exocet missile at Moore&rsquo;s ankles and bundled the big number 8 into touch.\u00a0 Trinity won the lineout and Jack Kelly was busy making a nuisance as usual.\u00a0 Joyce&rsquo;s frustration blew over and he struck the second row giving Trinity a penalty.\n\nThe ball was kicked dead and Trinity had completed an unlikely but fantastically entertaining comeback.\u00a0 DUFC now sit joint top of the league alongside Ballynahinch.", "Imageurl": "13286", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13284", "Heading": "Trinity Overturn Malone in College Classic"}
