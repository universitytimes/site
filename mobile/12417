Each year undergraduate students are invited to submit their best papers or coursework with the winners selected through an academic review process by panels made up of academics and industry professionals.\n\nThe awards have rapidly expanded and are now open to students in their final or penultimate year of an undergraduate degree in all the institutions of Ireland and selected top universities in the US, Canada and the UK.\n\nThis year there were over 2890 submissions in 21 categories from 64 different nationalities. An Irish and an international winner are selected in each category covering all academic disciplines. TCD winners of 2012 were in English Literature, International Relations and Politics, Modern Cultural Studies and Philosophical Studies and Theology.\n\nPresident Michael D Higgins will award the winners at a ceremony in Dublin on 9th November. Recipients of the prize will have their papers published in the UA journal, take part in the 3 day UA summit in Dublin, become part of a global alumni network and have access to exclusive networking and employment opportunities.<strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.6371130240149796\">\n</strong>", "Imageurl": "12418", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12417", "Heading": "Four Trinity Students Among Winners at Undergraduate Awards"}
