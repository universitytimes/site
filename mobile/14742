She lamented the fact that by the end of college, many students are still unaware what career they want to pursue in life. She also focused on the issues of student housing and lunchtime opening hours for the Health Centre so that students &ldquo;won&rsquo;t have to wait out in the rain&rdquo;.\n\nFollowing Aljohmani was <strong>Rosa Langhammer</strong> who, despite having &ldquo;lost [her] voice a bit&rdquo; due to the strains of campaigning, was at pains to avoid &ldquo;[saying] the same stuff&rdquo; that previous candidates have said in her position. She stressed that, in recent years, &ldquo;very little has changed or been accomplished&rdquo;. She went through the five points of her manifesto such as her proposed Trinity mobile app and further off-campus emphasis.\n\nLast of the candidates to speak was the still hunger-striking <strong>Tom Lenihan</strong>, seemingly buoyed by the vocal and visible &lsquo;Team Tom&rsquo;. He also spoke on the issue of internships, saying that current moves by SU President Rory Dunne are &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and that he will look to extend the initiative into other areas. He emphasised the importance of grants to Trinity students and took on an emotive tone speaking about the issue of mental health, a &ldquo;personal&rdquo; issue for the candidate. He dismissed the assertion, made by an audience member during Q and A, that, as the only male candidate, he may be less approachable than his female competitors as regards this issue. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there&rdquo;, he said, claiming that it was not a gender issue.\n\nComparisons can be made as far as the three candidates are concerned regarding their plans to further implement internships schemes. Lenihan, who acknowledges a broad similarity between his and Rory Dunne&rsquo;s plans, has stressed his experience with Law Soc in obtaining student internships. Though not an issue included in her manifesto, one of Rosa Langhammer&rsquo;s campaign managers Rois\u00edn Kirby, speaking in place of Langhammer who became ill later in the day, explained that her candidate worked with Dunne on his campaign last year and would seek to continue the work he has done. Aljohmani, meanwhile, stressed the importance of utilising Trinity&rsquo;s alumni through the Alumni Office in order to procure internships for students if even for &ldquo;a week or two in Christmas or summer time&rdquo;.\nThe candidates, minus the unwell Langhammer whose campaign staff spoke in her place, attended a Fine Gael hustings in the evening and will attend LGBT hustings in the Arts Block tomorrow evening.\n\n<em>Fionn O'Dea</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ents\u00a0</strong></h3>\nDay two of campaigning and the Ents candidates were out in force at Hustings to woo the masses with their revolutionary proposals.\n\n<strong>Conor 'Shmeesh' Gleeson</strong> was up first to speak but in a dramatic and extremely unfortunate turn of events, lost his voice only moments before his big moment. His PR manager was quickly drafted in and took the crowd by surprise by reciting a poem whilst Shmeesh smoked and handed manifestos to those trying to enter and exit the Dining Hall inconspicuously. The crowd were left 'shmeechless' after the majestical moment and questions were completely forgotten about at the end. Unable to speak directly with UT, campaign manager David (Shme)Egan stated on his behalf that Shmeesh has been happy with the day&rsquo;s progress and spent the morning in the Hamilton - his first time venturing to this side of the campus in four years &ndash; where he was &ldquo;\u00a0impressed with the facilities out there.&rdquo; Reiterating the success of the campaign video, (Shme)Egan commented that is was &ldquo;the most viewed YouTube video in Ireland on Monday.&rdquo;\n\nFellow Ents hopeful <strong>Cameron McCauley</strong> took time out after hustings to tell UT about his delight at the progress of the day. In response to his Hustings entrance on rollerblades (in which his supporters helped him onto the platform) Cameron stated &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know there would be steps.&rdquo; Describing the library as &ldquo;the place where the sesh goes to die,&rdquo; Cameron told UT about his run to the library, taking place at 8pm tonight, in which he will not stop running until it is permanently closed. Taking several moments in the interview to sign cans of Bavaria for fans who approached him as he leaned suavely against an Arts Block pillar, Cameron stated that &ldquo;people want to drink cans, not books.&rdquo; \u00a0When questioned about whether or not scholars such as Oscar Wilde would approve of his drastic transformation of Trinity&rsquo;s scholarly reputation by terminating the library, Cameron noted how &ldquo;Oscar would have been a brother in arms.., sure he was mad for the sesh,&rdquo; and that he was merely continuing his legacy.\n\nConfidence was running high in the <strong>Reynolds</strong> for Ents camp today as Reynolds maintained his momentum with a campus-wide canvassing team. Reynolds was the last among the Ents candidates to speak at today&rsquo;s Dining Hall hustings\u00a0emphasised\u00a0his desire to bring Ents nights to new venues and off-campus interaction with other event organizers. A spokesperson for the Reynolds for Ents team summarized his feelings on the race so far by asserting that Reynolds &lsquo;is the only candidate taking the race seriously&rsquo;. Reynolds himself hailed his own team&rsquo;s &lsquo;great turnout&rsquo;, claiming that they &lsquo;helped ease the nerves&rsquo; of his first hustings and hailing it as a &lsquo;great opportunity to share my ideas for what Ents could be&rsquo;.\n\n<strong>Cian Mulville</strong> can also claim a productive day of making his claim for the Ents throne. Mulville for Ents released it&rsquo;s first promotional video today, extolling Mulville as a &lsquo;survivor&rsquo; as well as taking a leaf from the Cameron McAuley book of\u00a0 campaigning and claiming the candidate &lsquo;spent six years in an army tank&rsquo;. The video has racked up an impressive 526 views as of this evening. Mulville used today&rsquo;s hustings as a chance to promise more transparency in the Ents executive and restated his desire for buses to and from Halls for Ents events, as well as Ents events to coincide with sporting events inside the college. Mulville told <em>The University Times</em> that he believes his manifesto to be the most inclusive of the Ents candidates, claiming \u00a0\"there&rsquo;s something for everyone in there and I think that sets me apart.\"\n\n<strong>Clarification:</strong><em> Yesterday, this newspaper reported on allegations that Conor Gleeson's campaign team had illegitimately garnered Facebook likes for their campaign page. \u00a0After an investigation by the Electoral Commission, these allegations have proven unfounded.\u00a0</em>\n<em>Shauna Cleary &amp; Carl Kinsella</em>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_14746\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/02/05/trinity-elects-day-two/hustings1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14746\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-14746\" title=\"hustings1\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hustings13-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> The excitement is too much for one campaigner at today's dining hall hustings. Photo: Shauna Watson[/caption]\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Communications</strong></h3>\nThe Communications race continued today with the four candidates taking part in the Hustings on the steps of the Dining Hall. As the contest is still in its early days, addresses were relaxed and focused mainly on the content of each candidate's manifesto, with few questions following.\n\n<strong>Leanna Byrne</strong> was up first, stressing the need for <em>The University Times</em> to \"get to everywhere that it doesn't\" on campus. This can be helped in part by her UT app, the prototype of which will be developed and re-designed over the summer months and will be available free of charge to all students come September. When questioned, she emphasised that her proposed TCD Student Hub website will require all posters to use their TCD student number to ensure full accountability and protect against cyber-bullying and trolling. In a blog post later in the day, Byrne further stated that members of the Communications Committee would act as moderators on the website, hopefully giving the committee more direction. Leanna's campaign stunt, as yet unknown, will take place tomorrow.\n\n<strong>Tommy Gavin</strong> followed, recapitulating the fact that each edition of UT currently costs the SU between 1500-3000 euro to produce and announcing his plans to cut this figure in half, freeing up money for other services which might need it more, and also paving the way for a \"better\" <em>University Times</em>. He went on to address the question of why he is the only candidate not to propose the creation of a UT app, saying that he does not see a need for one; as apps are separate from the internet, he affirmed, it would be cheaper and easier simply to expand the mobile-friendliness of the online version of the paper.\n\n<strong>Ricky McCormack</strong> spoke next, stating that though many people believe that the main role of the Communications Officer is editor of <em>The University Times</em>, the paper should in fact be used by the officer as a tool to make students more aware of the proceedings in the SU. He also mentioned his intention to \"promote Trinity outside college\", through means such as student internships. When questions came around, fellow candidate Gavin asked if McCormack has any experience with <em>The University Times</em> and, if not, what qualifies him to edit it. McCormack replied that due to his background with other college publications, he knows \"how to edit serious journalism\" and is perfectly qualified for the position.\n\nFinally, <strong>Matthew Taylor</strong> talked of the primary role of the Communications Officer being to \"get information out to students\" and the need for more \"spectacle\" in doing so, rather than the \"boring bureaucratic entity\" which currently comprises the SU. He also mentioned the need for more multimedia forms to be used in The University Times. Taylor's campaign team placed a mannequin in the arts block today, representing the student body, with which students could have their photo taken and on which they could write personal complaints about the Students&rsquo; Union. They also began filming Taylor&rsquo;s campaign video, set to be released in the coming days.\n\n<em>Hannah Ryan</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Education</h3>\nAll three Education candidates performed strongly in the hustings, taking the opportunity to push manifesto policies.\n\n<strong>John Curtin&rsquo;s</strong> campaign began the day early, seeking out the attention of first-year students. &ldquo;We had two second years who went out to the halls this morning from 9 am for an hour and a half just to catch people on their way into campus. We&rsquo;ll do the same thing tomorrow morning and tomorrow night I&rsquo;ll be going out to the halls myself going door to door talking to the students personally.&rdquo; Curtin explained the importance of reaching out to students in the halls, as one of his main campaign points pertains exclusively to first-years. &ldquo;One of my main points for first year students is to have an education clinic in halls&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s very important to have an educational presence because if they aren&rsquo;t too sure about their course and thinking about changing they&rsquo;ll have somebody there to answer their questions. If you bring the service to the students it ends up being more approachable [and] accessible, making education more successful for the students.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Despite being favored in Sunday night&rsquo;s<em>\u00a0Campanile Electoral Study</em>\u00a0poll, <strong>Jack Leahy</strong> once again stressed that it won&rsquo;t affect his campaign efforts. &ldquo;We tried not to let the really good poll results cloud our vision. We&rsquo;re trying not to get ahead of ourselves.&rdquo; Similarly to Curtin, Leahy&rsquo;s campaign also targeted first-year students. &ldquo;We went out to the halls last night and were really well received. We had specific fliers for hall students to tell them what we could do for them, and that was really well taken.&rdquo; Leahy was happy to find that his campaign was the first to go through the halls. &ldquo;We managed to get there before the rest of the cavalry arrived about two or three hours later, so we were introducing the idea of elections to people.&rdquo; During the Husting today at lunchtime, Leahy hid inside the dining hall in order to &ldquo;make a bit of an appearance.&rdquo; During that time, he and his campaign team stressed their policies on skills for employment to the audience.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Speaking to this reporter today,<strong> Eric Tebay</strong> spoke of his desire to stress to students that he believes he is the most experienced person for the job. &ldquo;I decided to run for this job three years ago and all of my experience until now has been geared towards an education background.&rdquo;\u00a0\u00a0Speaking of his experience this past year as EMS Faculty Convenor, he said, &ldquo;I basically do the same job that an education officer would do but on a smaller scale.&rdquo; Since he decided in his first year to run for education officer,\u00a0\u00a0he has kept a close eye on what previous education officers have done and believe this will help him if elected. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen what they&rsquo;ve achieved, and I think it&rsquo;s given me a better perspective of what&rsquo;s an achievable goal and what&rsquo;s just an idealistic goal. My policies are ambitious, yes, but definitely achievable.&rdquo; Today, Tebay had campaigners in the Arts Block and Hamilton and later headed out to D&rsquo;Olier Street to &ldquo;make sure the nurses know they&rsquo;re not forgotten.&rdquo; Tomorrow he intends to do the same with the medical students at St. James&rsquo; Hospital. &ldquo;No one gets forgotten with this education officer,&rdquo; he said.</span>\n<em>Becky Prager</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Welfare</strong></h3>\nIt was another busy day around campus for sole Welfare candidate <strong>Stephen Garry</strong>, especially with the first hustings debate. Garry reiterated his wide range of experience and collegiate involvement. He stressed the fact that he wants to increase the online presence of the Welfare officer and also the improvement of off-campus facilities. A question was put to Garry at hustings concerning his stance on the upcoming referendum on gender identity and the preferendum on abortion. He replied firstly with saying he is absolutely in favour of the gender issue as he feels the SU is not discriminatory but it is wise to have it written into the constitution. Regarding the abortion issue he felt it was unfair to take a side as he wants to be open and approachable for everyone to come to him no matter what the issue may be.\n\nResulting from this answer I asked Garry how much of the Welfare officer&rsquo;s role is pastoral and how much involves advocacy to which he responded that he would look out for the welfare \"of all students in college\". The candidate went on to say that he would \"achieve this through casework, offering non-judgemental and non-directional advice and support to whoever needs it.\" Garry also outlined his intention to introduce new Welfare campaigns as a means of advocating the causes he feels are important to Trinity students.\n\n<em>Rebecca O'Keeffe</em>", "Imageurl": "14747", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/trinity-elects13", "ID": "14742", "Heading": "Trinity Elects: Day Two"}
