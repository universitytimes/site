{"Body": "<p>DUBES, or, more formally, the Dublin University Business and Economics Society, is one of the oldest societies on campus. Founded in 1929, this year is the 80th Session of the Society, and we have some appropriately huge events ready for you to enjoy. Despite the name, DUBES isn&rsquo;t just for Business and Economics students, but the whole Arts Block. Come get to know us at our Freshers&rsquo; Week stand, where for &euro;3, you can become one of the DUBES family and receive our Welcome Pack, full to the brim with the best freebies including condoms, free pizza, and hangover prevention tablets (a recipe for a great night out).</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a taste of the debauched DUBES parties to come, you can also pick up tickets for The Traffic Light Ball in Association with Trinity Ents, our Monday Night event, and Dubious, our Wednesday Freshers&rsquo; Week night out in association with CancerSoc. Dubious in Spy&amp;Wax is our way of helping you get over that midweek lull; with the best promos for freshers and proceeds going to Cancer charities, you can atone for your bad behaviour at the Traffic Light Ball by heading out again for some Dubious fun.</p>\n<p>Unlike some other societies on campus, DUBES won&rsquo;t forget about you once you&rsquo;re a member. No, DUBES is the society that just can&rsquo;t stop giving. Our two trips away during the year are guaranteed to be unforgettable experiences, and a great way to make friends in first year. Whether you&rsquo;re going mad in Galway or getting blotto in Berlin, we promise you the best weekends of your Junior Freshman year. Not only will you have the time of your life, but you&rsquo;ll also get to know your classmates better than you ever thought you would, and maybe even better than you ever wanted to!</p>\n<p>Lest you worry, DUBES ain&rsquo;t no fair-weather friend. When things start hitting fans in the run up to up to exams, we have a dedicated team of nerds ready to help you out with all BESS subjects, from Business to Economics and back again via the dreaded Maths and Stats.</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>DUBES, or, more formally, the Dublin University Business and Economics Society, is one of the oldest societies on campus.
