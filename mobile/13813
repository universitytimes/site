Their lead could have been bigger were Carty not having an off day with his place kicking, missing all three conversions and an early penalty attempt.\n\nTrinity tried to settle themselves and had a few forays into the Buccs twenty-two where Tom Collis and Brian Du Toit carried aggressively and strongly. \u00a0On one occasion Collis crossed the line but it was deemed held-up much to the surprise of Collis, his teammates and indeed the Buccaneers defence. \u00a0However Trinity spoiled their opportunities through indiscipline, handling errors and just plain bad luck.\n\nBuccs, to their credit, were awesome with Heffernan and Kiripati very hungry in defence, consistently seeking out Trinity&rsquo;s go-to ball carriers for special attention. \u00a0One grimacing hit on Paddy Lavelle caused a loud groan around Dubarry Park with even the home fans feeling its force.\n\nCarty added another penalty to make it 18-7 and then Trinity&rsquo;s game plan began to unravel.\n\nOuthalf David Joyce went off injured with a nasty looking ankle injury before half-time but his \u00a0replacement Cathal Marsh and the impressive Ciaran Wade added penalties to make it 18-13.\n\nHowever, Trinity were now playing a reactive game to Buccs, having to respond to the home teams actions rather than try and hold possession and set their own tempo. \u00a0Jack Kelly was playing as strongly as ever, making dozens of tackles and carrying with menace to the Buccs line. But a further bout of soft defending off a Buccs lineout saw Kiripati go over for his second try to make it 25-13 at half-time, Buccs having secured the bonus point.\n\nAfter halftime Trinity began to assert themselves a bit more on the game with Collie McDonnell and Martin Kelly having strong cameos from the bench.\nAfter some excellent inter-play between David Fanagan and Niyi Adelokun down the left touchline Trinity opened their account with Neil Hanratty sliding over for a try. Marsh&rsquo;s excellent conversion from the touchline made it 20-25.\n\nKiripati, who was only returning from injury, began to drift out of the game as his opposite number Jack Dilger joined Kelly and Du Toit in aggressively taking the ball to the Buccs line, being much more proactive against a Buccs side mystified at how they had let DUFC back into the match. \u00a0Ciaran Wade was distributing brilliantly across the backline and making a number of outstanding breaks on the outside to get Trinity down the pitch. \u00a0Wade put in one massive hit on Leyden that saw Trinity win a penalty to kick down the line.\nIt was the start of prolonged period of Trinity pressure in the Buccs twenty-two that failed to produce a score. The seminal moment of the game occurred when within sight of the try line, Adelokun elected to cut infield rather than dive. \u00a0Given how wet the pitch was, a dive may have carried him over the try line.\n\nMarsh reduced the gap to two points with his penalty kick but it was to be Trinity&rsquo;s last say of the game as again in search of scoring chances they became frantic and flustered. \u00a0Buccs, who had played superb rugby in the first half clung on for a huge win that ended DUFC&rsquo;s unbeaten run in the Ulster Bank League that had stretched back to October 2011.\n\nYet, despite a fruitless foray in Athlone, defeat can&rsquo;t take the gloss off what has been a phenomenal calendar year for Dublin University Football Club.", "Imageurl": "13814", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13813", "Heading": "Bucc Stops with Trinity Defeat in Athlone"}
