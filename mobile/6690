Written from the perspective of a repentant gay person, the letter suggested that they &ldquo;acknowledge the wrong they have done&rdquo;, saying that homosexuality &ldquo;destroys the soul of the individual, and infects the surrounding area with vice and defilement&rdquo;. &ldquo;For the well-being and development of the nation,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;this evil has to be purged out of society&rdquo;.</p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_6691\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"224\" caption=\"Letter hand-delivered to PantiBar at 1.30PM today\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=6691\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6691\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-6691\" title=\"Letter Sent to PantiBar\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/pantibarpic-224x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The letter was posted on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/panti\">PantiBar&rsquo;s Facebook page</a> shortly after 4PM this afternoon with the comment that it was &ldquo;hand-delivered to [the bar] today.&rdquo; General manager of PantiBar, Shane Harte, said that it had been handed in to one of the bar&rsquo;s staff who had been cleaning outside at about 1.30PM.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The incident has been reported to the Garda\u00ed, who are examining PantiBar&rsquo;s CCTV footage in an effort to find the individual who delivered the letter. Mr. Harte said that his initial reaction had been &ldquo;to throw it in the bin&rdquo;. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t find it to be threatening. It was more amusing to be honest. It seems like some kind of religious fanatic. We haven&rsquo;t been called Gubu Bar for years. Clearly they aren&rsquo;t well acquainted with the Dublin gay scene.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The letter was addressed to &lsquo;Gubu Bar&rsquo;, which is PantiBar&rsquo;s former name. The name changed about five years ago, Harte said, but it was more likely that the person who wrote the letter got these details from an old website that hadn&rsquo;t been changed than any intimate knowledge of the venue. Although the bar had never received a letter before, homophobic incidents like eggs being thrown from cars and graffiti in the bathrooms &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t be that unusual&rdquo;, he said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2011 has seen a number of high-profile incidents of homophobia in Ireland. In February TV presenter Brendan Courtney was attacked in what the Independent <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/independent-woman/celebrity-news-gossip/tv-star-back-on-feet-after-attack-2538072.html\">described as a &ldquo;queer bashing&rdquo;</a> on a night out on South Great George&rsquo;s Street. In July a media personality and journalist who was unnamed but <a href=\"http://www.herald.ie/news/chilling-cctv-images-of-the-smiling-suspects-after-celebrity-writer-subjected-to-lsquogaybashingrsquo-in-city-2814024.html\">referred to as &ldquo;well-known&rdquo;</a> was also reported to have been assaulted in a similar manner. And earlier that month an Irish National Teachers&rsquo; Organisation (INTO) conference heard that homophobic bullying was <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2011/0704/breaking60.html\">&lsquo;widespread&rsquo;</a> in Irish primary schools.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">David Doyle, auditor of Trinity College&rsquo;s Q Soc, said that the letter &ldquo;demonstrates that LGBTQ people in Ireland continue to face discrimination&rdquo;. He also said that the &ldquo;threat of violence&rdquo; remains &ldquo;a real issue&rdquo; for gay people in the country. &ldquo;While incidents of this nature remain few and far between, they do pose a serious threat. As such, all facets of society need to work to confront and challenge the views held by the minority who seek to oppose the existence of LGBTQ people in society.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this context, he said, the decision of TCDSU last night to <a href=\"http://www.trinitylgbt.com/?p=1885\">endorse a motion mandating</a> &ldquo;sabbatical officers of the Students&rsquo; Union to publically and actively campaign for equal marriage rights for LGBT students&rdquo; was a positive step.</p>\n</div>", "Imageurl": "6691", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6690", "Heading": "Prominent Dublin Gay Bar Receives Homophobic Letter"}
