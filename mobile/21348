The scholars are still waiting for confirmation from the charities before they announce who they will be donating the profits to.\r\n\r\nA range of locations will be used, including the Cricket Pitch, the Exam Hall and the Long Room Library. The students will be taken from as many disciplines as possible. Each faculty will be assigned three months, with December reserved for the Fellows and Scholars alumni.\r\n\r\nLiam Hallinan Sch., reading Theoretical Physics, said he &ldquo;may be&rdquo; taking part in &lsquo;The Scholars and Fellows Charity Calendar&rsquo;.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how people are going to feel about seeing their lecturers on it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be weird.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nHe continued stating: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good idea. It shows we don&rsquo;t take ourselves too seriously&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Hallinan explained that it saves him the stressful task of winter shopping: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a perfect Christmas present for the family&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nThe Scholar&rsquo;s Secretary, Amy Worrall, stressed that they produce &lsquo;we are absolutely adamant to produce a final product that is tasteful and that in no way harms the reputation of the College&rdquo; and they have liased with the College on it to ensure they are fully aware of its production.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the calendar hopes to be representative of as many disciplines as possible and to have a gender balance.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We are just hoping to give back,&rdquo; explained Worrall. &ldquo;Scholars receive a huge amount from the College and the charity calendar is just one way we are trying to give back a little!\"\r\n\r\nA complete list of Scholars and Fellows that will be taking part will be published at a later stage.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/public-theatre-announcement-2013.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21348", "Heading": "Scholars and Fellows to Produce Semi-Nude Calendar"}
