That&rsquo;s the number of days it&rsquo;s been since I\u00a0first confessed to a friend of mine that I was having feelings for a girl. That&rsquo;s\u00a0less than two years. Add a couple of weeks on to that number, and that&rsquo;s\nwhen I began having those feelings. Compared with the 7937 days that I&rsquo;ve\u00a0been alive, 560 days is not that long an amount of time. I&rsquo;m 21 and this\u00a0gigantic crazy life-changing experience only happened when I was 20.\n\nIt is for this reason that even though I wanted to join Q<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Soc this year\u00a0and felt confident enough to do so, I still remained quite anxious about it.\u00a0My late in life discovery, as I tend to see it as, made me think that perhaps I didn&rsquo;t quite belong in the LGBTQ community as others did. What did I have\u00a0in common with the first year who makes joining their LGBT college society a\u00a0priority, when there I was in first and second year never having a reason to\u00a0join myself? And who was I to hear stories of people coming out to their\u00a0parents, when I hadn&rsquo;t done so? When I still didn&rsquo;t know what exactly I\u00a0should even say to mine, what label to use? I didn&rsquo;t share the common\u00a0experiences of being bullied in school because of my sexuality. I&rsquo;d never\u00a0faced jeering or abuse when holding hands with or kissing someone of the\u00a0same sex in public. I hadn&rsquo;t been through a struggle with the outside world\u00a0and honestly, I never went through an internal struggle either. So who was I\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">to belong in this community?</span>\n\nWell, I was everything to belong there. To belong here. I became\u00a0sure of that after the first QSoc event this Freshers&rsquo; Week that took place on\u00a0the Monday night. And I was reassured with the next event, and the next\nand the next. By Friday of that week, I felt more at home than I had in the\u00a0longest time.\u00a0If you are in QSoc, you&rsquo;ll know that the assumptions I made just aren&rsquo;t\u00a0true, that there&rsquo;s no such thing as someone not belonging there, and if you\u00a0aren&rsquo;t involved with QSoc, well I hope you can trust me when I tell you that\u00a0they&rsquo;re not. Nothing I thought about fitting in came even close to being true.\u00a0As I&rsquo;m coming to the end of my Final Year, I can&rsquo;t help but reflect on\u00a0these past four years at Trinity. Nostalgia is hitting me in a big way. I&rsquo;ve met\u00a0incredible people and I&rsquo;ve had some truly amazing experiences since walking\u00a0through Front Arch in September 2009. I&rsquo;m not the same person that I was\u00a0then. I&rsquo;ve lived in four different places during my four years and none of\u00a0them have been the home that Trinity has been. And QSoc&hellip; Qsoc has been\u00a0a home also this past year. A home within a home. It is probably the best\u00a0decision I&rsquo;ve made and the best thing I&rsquo;ve done for myself in these last four\u00a0years.\n\n168 days. That&rsquo;s the number of days that I&rsquo;ve been a member of\u00a0Qsoc. I&rsquo;m the happiest, most comfortable and most confident me than I&rsquo;ve\u00a0ever been and it&rsquo;s all down to joining this society. Since joining I&rsquo;ve come\u00a0out to my parents (who were simply amazing!) and when I went through a\u00a0really bad experience coming out to another family member, Qsoc was there\u00a0for me. I&rsquo;ve begun to dance in clubs which I&rsquo;ve always hated doing and to\u00a0generally just be content to be my very weird but at times wonderful self. I belonged. I belong. And really, absolutely everyone does.\n\nWhen I sat down 560 days ago to email my friend and tell him that\u00a0I wanted to kiss a girl, I wasn&rsquo;t able to see very far into the future. To see\u00a0relationships with girls, my family knowing, or even my Granny asking about\nmy girlfriend. (!!) But if I had worried about the future, that&rsquo;s what I would\u00a0have thought about. I never imagined and never foresaw that in getting\u00a0ready to leave Trinity one of the hardest and saddest parts about leaving\u00a0college would be leaving QSoc also.\n\nI&rsquo;ve met some the most inspiring and beautiful people I believe the\u00a0world has to offer. I&rsquo;ve laughed the hardest and smiled the widest. I&rsquo;ll\u00a0always treasure the year I spent in this society and I urge everyone who is\nscared, anxious, shy, etc. to take a deep breath and just do it anyway. We&rsquo;ve\u00a0all been there and we all belong here.\n\nMy experience of QSoc has been this &ndash; it&rsquo;s nothing to do with your\u00a0sexuality and everything to do with who you are.
