Now going by the name Q Soc and with a shiny new logo, the society is moving onwards and upwards. LGBT friendly club nights have in recent years become the norm for any college student worth their salt and it makes sense for the society to branch out to other areas. Patrick Wolf&rsquo;s forthcoming visit to the society marks the beginning of their latest entertainment venture, to the realms of live gigs. Sitting in on the first of such sessions in the Pav&rsquo;s function room I grabbed myself a cider-and-dash and settled in as the evening began.\n\nThe night kicked off at 6 with a group already waiting for the acts to begin. First off, Darren Yorke took to the stage with a pint, his guitar and an arsenal of covers. His relaxed performances included songs varying from The Coors to Tina Turner and attracted the attention of other Pav-goers who began drifting in to have a listen.\n\nNext up was Eric McGrath, introduced as an &lsquo;up-and-coming&rsquo; act by host and Q Soc auditor David Doyle. Instant quiet befell the now amply occupied room as he began his set. Deciding how best to describe his sound is difficult; a dash of Villagers&rsquo; Conor O&rsquo;Brien, a sprinkle of Andrew Bird and the fast paced lyrics of Jack Johnson perhaps? Whatever the mix, it works! Drinkers from outside began to prick up their ears and listen in through the open doors and the rest of audience stealthily exchanged glances that assured me that I wasn&rsquo;t the only one enjoying his music, nearly all original compositions.\n\nWith the drinks flowing and the crowd still growing, Pamela Connolly, vocalist from &lsquo;The Trouble Is&rsquo; gave an uncommon solo performance. Pamela seemed right at home belting out her own songs, showcasing the talent that led her to win the 2fm Tayto song writing competition way back in 2007. With strong guitar chords and a distinctive powerful voice, comparisons with Heathers or Tegan and Sara are easily drawn. I&rsquo;d definitely be interested in hearing the band play together.\n\nA group that first came to attention when their cover of Kate Bush&rsquo;s Wuthering Heights hit YouTube, The Late Fragments started playing to a well and truly warmed up crowd. The fivesome&rsquo;s boyband-esque appearance and the lead singer&rsquo;s American-ish accent (reminiscent of The Script) oppose what is ultimately a likeable soft-rock sound. Their sound is laid back, catchy and they carry some strong melodies and harmonies very well. Not bad at all for a couple of lads from Dublin.\n\nAs the evening wound down, David thanked the acts and reminded the crowd to keep up to date with Q Soc&rsquo;s upcoming events. With the variety that is inherent in all LGBT activities, the relaxed location of the Pav and a trifling &euro;2 membership fee, I certainly will be back.", "Imageurl": "4862", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4861", "Heading": "Q Soc holds successful Pav gig"}
