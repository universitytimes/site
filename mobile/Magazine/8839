{"Body": "<em>By Jack Leahy </em>\n\nIt's the age-old student night out problem: you want to pre-drink at the Pav, but your UCD\nfriends want to stay in the Student Bar. A scuffle ensues and you all end up in the Pav, but\nnot everyone's happy about it. A very specific form of sectarianism has intervened to sour the\natmosphere and, accordingly, the entire evening.\n\nBut fear not! There is a solution. Sitting peacefully on Frenchman's Lane - 15 minutes from\nFront Arch, near Bus\u00e1ras - an ambitious project known as The Cave has arrived to provide an\nalternative, neutral pre-drinking venue for students across Dublin.\n\nIt's actually quite a difficult place to describe; it's like a club, but much more relaxed. In what\nis a fairly small venue, they somehow manage to seamlessly accommodate room to eat and\ndrink, space to sit and talk, and even an area for quiet reflection if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re into.\nFew have taken up the third option, but it's certainly a workable idea.\n\nMy friend and I attended on the opening night, which was very poorly advertised; only one\nnon-invasive Facebook event was created and there are no irritating friend requests from reps\nand mails about drink deals. Nonetheless, we found The Cave sufficiently attended that the\nowners may consider the night a success. Having been welcomed by the manager, a group\nof students at a nearby table invite us to play Jenga. At first the proposition comes across\nas absurd, but it is quickly communicated to us that this is the kind of place where 'pretty\nmuch anything sound goes', as long as you're enjoying yourself.\n\nThe Cave's student-friendly nature is propounded in both its advertisements and its prices.\nThree Jaegerbombs for &euro;9 is better than club prices, but that's not where the magic lies: a\ndelicious hand-made burger, plenty of fries, and a pint for &euro;8. Fantastic. I can honestly say\nI've never had a better burger in my life. Much like the absence of vague threats and knee-\nlength skirts, you certainly wouldn't get that in Howl at the Moon.\n\nSo why is this place so cool? For one thing, it's run by students. Brian, the guy in charge of\nrunning the place, is a regular student like the rest of us, balancing The Cave with training\nfor rugby and studying. It's becoming increasingly rare to see full-time students involved in\nrunning student nights, the result of which is that we rarely get what we really want from\nour many nocturnal urban excursions. Brian understands what students want from a nights\nout, and his product facilitates those of us who want to have a chat and a quiet one while\nproviding for our friends who want to dance to Stromae and the Smiths.\n\nThe lack of advertising may mean a few empty nights for the next few weeks, and while it's\nabsolutely worth it, the location will struggle to attract students from Trinity and UCD.\nIt has a lot going for it though and between the friendly staff &amp; client\u010dle, student-orientated\npricing and one hell of a good vibe.", "Imageurl": "<em>By Jack Leahy </em>\n\nIt's the age-old student night out problem: you want to pre-drink at the Pav, but your UCD\nfriends want to stay in the Student Bar.
