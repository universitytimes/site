Ames begins, emptying his last drop of bourbon as he struggles to tell his story. &nbsp;So starts Sam Shepard&rsquo;s melancholic, humorous foray into the tangled minds of Ames and Byron.

He wrote the parts for the two Irish actors, Sean McGinley and Stephen Rea, who&rsquo;s American drawls prove faultless. The actors are two and the premise is simple.Brien Vahey&rsquo;s minimalist set consists of a dusty wooden porch, two chairs and a table.

The stately Byron answers his old friend&rsquo;s desperate plea and makes the three day journey by Greyhound bus, fearful that Ames is on the brink of suicide. They begin to wind down a road of nostalgia, drowning their sorrows in local bourbon and soft downy memories, but end up stumbling upon rockier topics of conversation. Musing over their current sexual prowess, Ames describes the unfulfilling liaison with a younger woman that led to his exile while Byron laments his own failing libido. The conversation travels on, sometimes fluid and often discordant, as complex memories of hidden rivalries between the two resurface.

His facial contortions and exaggerated physicality verge on the ridiculous but never quite cross the line. He teeters on the edge of believability in so successful a way as to endow Ames with a license to do almost anything he pleases. When he runs for the shotgun, chasing his best friend through the barren countryside (imagined of course, for only the blank stage lies before us) none of the atmosphere is broken.</p>\n<p>These dynamic changes in energy serve only to reflect the volatility of this reluctantly aging man.
