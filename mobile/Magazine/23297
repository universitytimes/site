The event, which was organised by PR Boutique, was an elegant cocktail party to welcome the approach of summer. Binky Felstead, of Made in Chelsea fame, was there as the new face of the range.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">Binky Felstead has the right sort of effortless personality for Rimmel and the beach girl campaign</div></blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first room was set up as a pop-up salon. Several makeup artists and beauticians were on hand to transform guests with the new summer palettes. Rita Ora&rsquo;s new makeup collaboration was the product of the moment. The singer has brought out six Clinique-style chubby-stick lip colours. Of course being the night that it was, a wash of Sunshimmer Bronzer was a required addition for all to combat the Irish winter pallor.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/639168521_o-e1390594118821.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"639168521_o\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/639168521_o-1024x764.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"373\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The nail station was the next stop in order to take a sneak peak at the new Rita Ora nail varnish collection, soon to launch. It comes in a range of vivid colours, including the fashion-forward opaque neon white &ldquo;White Hot Love&rdquo;, which Binky wore on the night, to contrast her black wrap dress. The nail artist confided that they had arrived at the event at ten that morning to try out different looks, and prep Binky for a long day of interviews.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">A strawberry daiquiri, cosmopolitan and glass of pink champagne later, the woman of the night appeared</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Downstairs was the cocktail and cupcake party. Voices chattered away as appetizers of peking duck, spring roll and mussel soup were brought around. A strawberry daiquiri, cosmopolitan and glass of pink champagne later, the woman of the night appeared. Binky mingled with everyone, and was very obliging to those requesting photographs, despite the long day of presswork. I managed to grab her for a quick photo and a gossip about Made In Chelsea. The pint sized reality star was just as friendly and sweet as she comes across on the show. Binky was tiny (I managed to be taller than her in flats) despite her gorgeous four-inch coral Topshop heels with gold ankle bar and stem.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/709b36_c248c52342c313b4283bfc1038d4fdb1.jpg_srz_980_512_85_22_0.50_1.20_0.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-23305 aligncenter\" alt=\"709b36_c248c52342c313b4283bfc1038d4fdb1.jpg_srz_980_512_85_22_0.50_1.20_0\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/709b36_c248c52342c313b4283bfc1038d4fdb1.jpg_srz_980_512_85_22_0.50_1.20_0.jpg\" width=\"980\" height=\"512\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She was thrilled to become the new brand ambassador for Rimmel, in the company of Kate Moss, Rita Ora and Georgia May Jagger. She seemed relaxed and was enjoying the challenge in contrast to her day job on the reality show. This last season of Made in Chelsea saw a change in her role. Normally not involved in show, her relationship with Alex Mytton was splashed on everyone&rsquo;s TV, seeing Binky clash with several of his exes. The pair are still dating, as evidenced by her twitter photos of a romantic getaway to Goa last week. I asked her if the past season had been more difficult to film, considering that this was the first time she had had a relationship filmed in full on the show. The normally cheerful Binky gave a pained nod and, more frankly than I had expected, admitted it was much harder having that pressure on such a personal aspect of her life. She admitted it was tough, but had been prepared for it to eventually happen. She said that she knew what she signed up for and was thrilled by the ongoing support of her fans.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">The normally cheerful Binky gave a pained nod and, more frankly than I had expected, admitted it was much harder having that pressure on such a personal aspect of her life</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When it was time to leave, I grabbed one of the goodie bags, and headed back through Stephens Green. I was still awed by the down to earth nature of a girl whose reality show is based on her elite group of friends. Binky Felstead has the right sort of effortless personality for Rimmel and the beach girl campaign. The launch party showcased the playful new additions set to be added to the Rimmel stands this summer, particularly the Rita Ora nail varnishes, the most striking colours being a teal, 863 Do Not Disturb, and a Barbie pink, 323 Don&rsquo;t Be Shy. Rimmel has once again proved its dominance over all its rival pharmacy brands.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/binky-bafta.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23297", "Heading": "Rimmel Summer Launch"}
