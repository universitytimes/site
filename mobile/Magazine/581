{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>Continuing a trend of their last few releases, Animal Collective&rsquo;s latest offering leaked online days before it was officially released. This gave their dedicated fan base a much needed hit not experienced since the release of Merriweather Post Pavillion at the beginning of the year.</p>\n<p>Fall Be Kind is only a five track EP, but it&rsquo;s enough to tide fans over until their next album. Of the five tracks only one could be described as disappointing (track three, &ldquo;Bleeding&rdquo;), similar to &ldquo;No More Runnin&rdquo; on their last album and &ldquo;Seal Eyeing&rdquo; on Water Curses. By no means were any of these bad songs; they simply don&rsquo;t have the ability to become your favourite song of all time for a brief period, like most of this group&rsquo;s tracks.</p>\n<p>The EP opens with &ldquo;Graze&rdquo; (originally called &ldquo;Grace&rdquo;), a classic two-tiered Animal Collective track that starts off slow and then breaks into what can only be described as synth panpipe cheese.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What Would I Want? Sky&rdquo; follows with a nice bouncy feel reminiscent of a mellow take on &ldquo;Water Curses&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Track four, &ldquo;On a Highway&rdquo; is my favourite song on the EP, though others have been slow to warm up to it. It has joined one other Animal Collective song (&ldquo;Loch Raven&rdquo; off Feels) as the only things I would ever describe as &lsquo;hauntingly beautiful&rsquo;. The percussion that comes in half way through the track and the non-lyrical vocal segments imbue a sense of being lost in a tribal urban landscape.</p>\n<p>The EP finishes up with &ldquo;I Think I Can&rdquo;. The consensus seems to be that this is the best track on the album. The song opens with a very Battles-like sound, but quickly twists itself into the Animal Collective mould with a very epic sense about it.</p>\n<p>As an Animal Collective release, I don&rsquo;t feel that Fall Be Kind has a chance of toppling Water Curses as their best EP. However, it still contains four absolutely amazing tracks that I look forward to listening to over the coming months.</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>Continuing a trend of their last few releases, Animal Collective&rsquo;s latest offering leaked online days before it was officially released.
