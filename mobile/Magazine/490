{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>The evening of the second day of the Trinity Fringe Festival saw Killer Chloe playing a short set in the Hist Conversation Room. With the room&rsquo;s tables and chairs pushed back to make a large stage area, and the small but enthusiastic crowd seated on couches lining the walls, the atmosphere was casual and relaxed.

After 15/20 minutes of playing, the band were informed that they had to clear out immediately to make way for the next group who&rsquo;d booked the room. This slight cutting-short of the set &ndash; presumably the result of the late start - was fairly disappointing, but caused no major upset to the relaxed audience. Overall Killer Chloe seemed well-received by all present, with their synth-heavy pop/rock sound being entertaining, if nothing groundbreaking.</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>The evening of the second day of the Trinity Fringe Festival saw Killer Chloe playing a short set in the Hist Conversation Room.
