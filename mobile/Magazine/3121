As trends came and went during his near decade long career, Wolf remained solitary in the honing and evolving of his distinct sound. From his humble busking beginnings in the early noughties to the brash, heart on sleeve, OTT tendencies of his latest offering, it has always been difficult to pin Patrick down and compare him to any other musician or, even, genres. <em>Lupercalia</em> is Patrick Wolf's fifth release and is perhaps the closest thing to straight-out pop in Wolf's entire career. Last March I met with Patrick to discuss his new album, his Irish links and inspirations and, most importantly, his TCD lecturer uncle Chris.</p>\n<strong>Would you consider your new album, <em>Lupercalia</em>, to be the long touted part deux to The Bachelor or has it become its own individual record?</strong>\n\nI&rsquo;d say that there are some trace elements of what the second album was meant to be but this is, in truth, a whole new record. It was ambitious to think I could do a double album and after 2 years, when the second part of the album hadn&rsquo;t even been finished, release <em>The Bachelor 2</em>. Naturally, I just worked myself out of a place mentally, and as a writer I think that I&rsquo;d already written myself away from the questions and answers of <em>The Bachelor</em>.\n\n<strong>You&rsquo;ve worked with some acclaimed people during your career, which has been your favourite?</strong>\n\nI really cherished having Tilda Swinton on Thesues. She&rsquo;s a really great actress, she was in a film called Orlando which was a big influence on me when I was a teenager, and then later on I discovered all the work she did for Derek Jarman, really great films like <em>Jubilee</em> and <em>The Last of England</em>. Working with people that I look up to is something that makes my work as a performer really exciting. It&rsquo;s not something I ever set out to achieve but when these things happen randomly it&rsquo;s great, I have to wake up the next day and ask myself &lsquo;what the hell just happened?&rsquo;\n\n<strong><em>Lupercalia</em>, however, has a distinct lack of collaborations compared to your previous work, why is that?</strong>\n\nYeah that was a deliberate thing. I just thought that it was time to get self-sufficient again and try not to pass certain things over to other characters and musicians. As a writer, it was very much about just being me from beginning to end and not really going on any diversions with other people.\n\n<strong>As a professional musician you&rsquo;ve been around a deceivingly long time, 10 years I&rsquo;d estimate, what has changed in the music industry since you began?</strong>\n\nWell a lot of bands have come and gone. Is there any I miss? NONE OF THEM! Nah, Larkin Love were a fantastic band but they didn&rsquo;t last very long. I wish they were still around. In terms of the music industry as a whole, a lot has obviously changed. I tried with Bandstock with <em>The Bachelor</em>, but that didn&rsquo;t work out as I would have liked. The whole thing is a mess and is going to be very difficult to fix.\n\n<strong>Is Ireland a country you visit often?</strong>\n\nWell, as a musician, not really. I played a show in 2005, toured the Magic Position in 2007 and did Electric Picnic last year. The main reason I do come over is to visit cousins, aunts and uncles. I don&rsquo;t know so much about the music industry and the audiences and stuff here but Clonakilty in Cork feel somewhat like home. Although most of my family have moved to Dublin now, my aunt still has a farm there and we&rsquo;re planning a big family trip to Inchydoney soon. West Cork is a beautiful place; it&rsquo;s my dream land. I only seem to come to Dublin for weddings and funerals.\n\n<strong>Do you have any links with Trinity College?</strong>\n\nYes actually, my uncle Chris lectures physics&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s physics. I did, in fact, attend Trinity College, but it was Trinity Music College in London where I did composition and played harp. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ve never been to your Trinity but I&rsquo;ve heard it&rsquo;s a lovely place.\n\n<strong>On the topic of musical study, it is quite well known that you have a keen talent for many types of instruments.</strong>\n\nNot talented, more lucky and persistent. Right now I&rsquo;m really enjoying re-learning the Celtic Harp, which was, coincidentally, one of my first instruments.\n\n<strong>Would it be true to say that your Irish routes tend to permeate a good deal into your music and your lyrics?</strong>\n\nI tend to embrace folklore, and not just the Irish side, in much of my music. On this album, for example, there are a lot of little phrases in there of things my Granddad used to say. Talk of &lsquo;mother Ireland&rsquo; and &lsquo;father Albion&rsquo;, which was my mother&rsquo;s side and my father&rsquo;s side. On the last album a lot of reels, fiddles and pipes were featured. It&rsquo;s all very much to do with how I was raised and the family heritage and that all show through musically I think.\n\n<em>Lupercalia</em> is out now. Patrick Wolf plays Oxegen in July\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "3122", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "3121", "Heading": "An Interview with Patrick Wolf"}
