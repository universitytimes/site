We were treated to the talents of resident DJs Ronan Hayes and Stevie McDermott as well as guest DJs Alan Taylor and Frank Grimes, every set going down deliciously well as it was pumped into the outside smoking area where heads were bopping and mouths were munching in time to the beats. Inside, the atmosphere peaked during live performances by Dave O Carroll who electrified the early arrivals with electronic music, Nick Fitzgerald who relaxed the crowd with his voice and guitar, his songs leaving a smile on everyone&rsquo;s face and last but certainly not least Giraffes. This jazz &ndash; pop band&rsquo;s members are no strangers to the stage. Having performed at last year&rsquo;s Trinity Ball under the name Jools King, their confidence and comfort on stage left the Electric Relaxers assured that they were in for a treat. Despite arriving an hour late, the divas, they wowed the crowd with their astounding range of talent, Front-men Danny Forde and Pats O Leary sharing the mic, the piano and the guitar while Oli Welfare kept things up-beat on drums. The set was short and sweet, inspiring a few girls to really go for it on a make-shift dance floor (basically the stage) while the rest of the bar packed out with eager listeners. The trio can often be heard and seen at various Trinity musical events, mostly with the Jazz Society or Players. &nbsp;The Bus outside the smoking area also hosted a cluster of comedy acts including the charming Conor O&rsquo;Toole, resident act Street Justice and Heber Hanly who sent the bus rocking with laughter.</p>\n<p>While all the acts were busy entertaining the Electric Relaxers&rsquo; ears, their mouths were concerned with the hot, fresh cheese toasties, (with or without relish, but obviously with) and the scrumptious baked treats of the lovely Lexie Hamblin who regaled customers with her charming tale of her quest to climb mount Kilimanjaro while slicing them a chunk of Victoria Sponge cake, or tossing them a cookie, brownie or cupcake, the proceeds of which were going towards the charity funding the climb. With treats in hand, one could then take a trip to the make-shift art gallery and allow their eyes to absorb the walls of colourful talent.
