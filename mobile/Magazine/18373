After releasing an album on Opal Tapes, Lumigraph is now set to release his debut EP on New York&rsquo;s Mister Saturday Night. Definitely a producer to keep an eye on.\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/mistersaturdaynight/lumigraph-yacht-cruiser-msn007?in=mistersaturdaynight/sets/lumigraph-yacht-cruiser-ep\r\n\r\n<b>John Wizards &ndash; Lusaka By Night </b>\r\n\r\nTaken from their amazing debut album on Planet Mu Records, John Wizards&rsquo; off kilter South African pop is not to be missed. &ldquo;Lusaka By Night&rdquo; is a great blend of skilfully manipulated auto-tune vocals and joyous African rhythms.\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/planetmurecords/john-wizards-lusaka-by-night\r\n\r\n<b>Metallica &ndash; For Whom The Bell Tolls</b>\r\n\r\nRevisiting our roots here down at UT Magazine. The third track taken from Metallica&rsquo;s 1984 album <i>Ride The Lightening</i> &ldquo;For Whom The Bell Tolls&rdquo; has always had big part in our hearts and now it&rsquo;s on constant repeat for the umpteenth time in our lives.\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/17HRV8k1YMw\r\n\r\n<b>Jeru The Damaja &ndash; Come Clean</b>\r\n\r\nOne of the most instantly recognisable tracks from Jeru&rsquo;s classic album <i>The Sun Rises in the East</i>. Jeru recently announced that he will play Dublin&rsquo;s Sugar Club on October 31<sup>st</sup>. Although he&rsquo;s now in his 40s, this is one gig not to be missed.\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/2B5dOCSBBEI\r\n\r\n<b>Duke Dumont &ndash; Need U (100%) (Artful Bootleg Remix)</b>\r\n\r\nA fantastic Garage remix of Duke Dumont&rsquo;s horribly over played 2012 hit. The remix is very reminiscent of early 2000s UKG, giving new light to a track that was played over 3 million times on YouTube this year alone.\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/futuregarage/need-u-100-by-duke-dumont-ft-a", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Fotor090813232.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18373", "Heading": "What We&rsquo;re Listening To"}
