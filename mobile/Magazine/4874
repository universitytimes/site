{"Body": "<strong>Aoife Considine\u00a0</strong>\n<em>Staff Writer</em>\n\nStarting college is stressful; we all know this. Couple this with starting college in one of Ireland&rsquo;s most prestigious universities and one known for its high level of style and it&rsquo;s just one more thing for freshers to worry about. I took to front square this week with my photographer Chloe Keogan to see how the fresher&rsquo;s were faring fashion wise.\n\nMy aim for the week was to focus on what freshers&rsquo; views were on fashion in TCD and whether they felt pressured to dress well. Along with this, I wanted to take a look at how course choice effects personal style and maybe bust a few myths associated with this.\n\nWe know the fashion stereotypes all too well in Trinity; the BESS heads with their fake-tan, false eyelashes, Uggs, Paul&rsquo;s Boutique handbags and Juicy Couture tracksuits, the ABKs (Arts Block Kids) clad head-to-toe in either vintage, Topshop, or an amalgamation of both and usually topping off outfits with some form of structured hat, and then anyone who studies in any of the buildings past the Pav is usually assumed to be wearing a pair of O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s tracksuit bottoms and their course hoodie or something else non-descript on top, maybe a pair of Assics for good measure.\n\nThankfully, this new brood of freshers is breaking these assigned course moulds, as I&rsquo;m happy to admit that I found fashionable lads and lassies from all faculties mooching about Front Square all week.\n\nIt was not hard to find viable candidates worthy of being photographed for their style,\u00a0Rose, a European Studies student dressed in shades of blue and grey, and with an autumnal coloured scarf draped nonchalantly around her neck she was a perfect ode to &ldquo;fall&rdquo;. Although donning the typical arts block fresh faced look and carrying a vintage bag, Rose admitted to already feeling pressure to dress well having heard of the infamous catwalk that is the arts block of TCD. Her style although befitting of the arts building was a much softer take on their stereotypical style and showed how even when dressing for the weather you can look chic and stylish.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=4885\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4885\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4885\" title=\"Rose\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Rose.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"481\" height=\"420\" /></a></p>\n<em>Rose- European Studies</em>\n\nNext up is Aifric and Ciara, although both studying French, their sense of style was much more in tune with that of Great Britain.\n\nAifric, rocking a short hair style, a white tee with a doodle of a fixie on it and possibly the coolest light bulb necklace I&rsquo;ve ever seen. She would not have looked out of place strolling though London&rsquo;s Camden market, while Ciara&rsquo;s outfit was reminiscent of the English countryside with her paisley print skirt, rich wine knitted cardi and brown leather brogues.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=4888\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4888\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4888\" title=\"Aifric\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Aifric.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"631\" /></a></p>\n<em>Aifric - French and Film</em>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=4889\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4889\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4889\" title=\"Ciara\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ciara.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"530\" height=\"393\" /></a></p>\n<em>Ciara - French and Russian</em>\n\nDue to the torrential rain that had started on the Thursday, we decided to abandon our style search early to start afresh on Friday, which thankfully saw clearer skies. Although the skies were clearer, people&rsquo;s heads post Arthur&rsquo;s Day were clearly not and it took until late afternoon until we saw a vision floating across the cobbles of Front Square in little heeled boots.\n\nSo far, the arts students were staying true to their stereotype as the most fashionable (kids on the) block, but I wanted to find some style from the other end of college. Sarah dressed angelically in soft cream and black was the answer to my prayers. She posed for us patiently as though she was randomly pulled aside and photographed all the time and was polite and confident in her interview. She is studying Natural Science and clearly has a keen eye for fashion, even claiming to be unimpressed by the &ldquo;shabbily&rdquo; dressed people of Trinity she&rsquo;d seen so far.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=4890\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4890\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4890\" title=\"Sarah\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Sarah.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"362\" /></a></p>\n<em>Sarah - Science</em>\n\nHere is Ryan, our first stylish male fresher of the week. Although Trinity is renowned for stylish males; Stephen Moloney, Colin McGrane or even this very publication&rsquo;s web editor, Peter Twomey, to name but a few, when it comes to freshers I&rsquo;m sad to announce that there are hard found. Then again, I was restricting my style search to the fresher&rsquo;s stands in Front Square, maybe not the coolest or most trendy spot to be hanging out for a stylish male first year.\n\nAs such, when we spotted Ryan we ran to him.He was wearing a Harley Davidson t-shirt he&rsquo;d gotten in some obscure Harley Davidson tshirt selling store, very alt indeed. Unfortunately, as we later found out, he actually attends Maynooth. Nevertheless, such original style on the cobbles of Trinity shall not be ignored.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=4891\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4891\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4891\" title=\"Ryan\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Ryan.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"538\" height=\"407\" /></a></p>\nRyan\n\nAfter the revelation that Ryan didn&rsquo;t actually attend Trinity we&rsquo;d almost given up hope of finding any stylish male freshers. It was late Friday afternoon and the stands were starting to be taken down. Could this be true? Were there really no stylish males coming into Trinity?\n\nThen, we spotted them. Strolling across Front Square, Shane and Daniel, both male, both stylish, both freshers, and both thankfully in Trinity. To add to this, they were both doing Science. Although claiming not to feel pressure to dress well in Trinity and that they really &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t be arsed&rdquo;, the two were a lot more stylish than most males we&rsquo;d seen all week. Their relaxed cool look may not be up to arts block bow tie and tweed blazer standard but they show that not all Hamilton folk are as badly dressed as the myth alludes.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=4892\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4892\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4892\" title=\"Shane\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Shane.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"565\" height=\"459\" /></a></p>\n<em>Shane - Science</em>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=4893\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4893\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4893\" title=\"Daniel\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Daniel.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"397\" height=\"688\" /></a></p>\n<em>Daniel - Science</em>\n\nIn deciphering fresher fashion, there is no doubt they are indeed a very stylish bunch. But how do they fit into our assumed stereotypes? The arts students are perpetually stylish and are probably not going to break that mould any time soon. Their clothes reflect their course choice and in turn their way of life. Arts block kids are creative thinkers and this shows through their clothing. On the other end of the spectrum, you have Maths, Science and Engineering types and the few I did find are breaking free of their unstylish mould and are much more open to fashion although it may not be as linked to their course choice.\n\nThat said, geometric shapes and functionality have a lot to do with the Maths and Sciences and this can be seen in our three science students. Although Sarah&rsquo;s overall look is stylish, she keeps to a strict colour palette, her outfit is put together meticulously, \u00a0as if adhering to strict procedure, and the overall result is polished and precise, very different to the more creative yet laid-back outfits seen on Rose, Aifric and Ciara. Even the boys&rsquo; outfits are quite functional, a word often associated with science. They each carried a bag and wore comfortable shoes and snug looking hoodies leaving the style in the detail of their outfits.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOverall I suppose it is true then to say that our course choice is reflected in how we dress but then I guess our personality also reflects our course choice and style is simply a portrayal of our personality through clothes.\u00a0 Although the more science-orientated courses will always prefer to dress for functionality and the arts block kids will dress more creatively, there will always be exceptions to the rule.\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=4894\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4894\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4894\" title=\"Closing image\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Closing-image.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"521\" height=\"359\" /></a></p>\nThumbs up to fashion!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "4894", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4874", "Heading": "New Kids on the Block"}
