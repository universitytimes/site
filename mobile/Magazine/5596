{"Body": "<strong>Aoife Considine</strong>\n<em>Staff Writer</em>\n<strong></strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold out, streets are thief-proof, A wind that blows right up your nose, A night not fit for a dog to be out in...&rdquo;\n\nOn Monday morning we were greeted by winter. Winter&rsquo;s not the kind of mate that you don&rsquo;t see for ages but still comes up and gives you a warm embrace when they see you again. No, winter&rsquo;s that friend that will ignore you for nine months, but still stay close enough so you know they&rsquo;re there, and so that you know you&rsquo;re going to run into them again, and when you finally do meet them , they act as though you&rsquo;re some forgotten one night-stand and give you the cold shoulder, in this week&rsquo;s case, the <em>very</em> cold shoulder.\n\nIt&rsquo;s true, winter ain&rsquo;t your friend, but here in Trinity this week I caught up with some people who were learning to stick it to winter in this season&rsquo;s most stylish winter gear.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #88396e;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Cream Knit</span></strong></span></h4>\nAfter Monday&rsquo;s kick up the ass weather-wise, we were all a bit more aware of what was in store for Tuesday and so began to dig to the back of our wardrobes and dig out the winter woolies. <a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5610\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5610\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5610 alignright\" title=\"1\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"213\" height=\"285\" /></a>\u00a0Luckily, the good old traditional Aran knit sweater is in trend this season and it&rsquo;s acceptable, nay &ldquo;cool&rdquo; nowadayas to wear that jumper that your granny knitted you in sixth class and that you&rsquo;ve only managed to &ldquo;grow into&rdquo; these eight years or so on. You really can&rsquo;t go wrong with a simple cream knit in this weather and it is a great versatile base to work around. Paired with coloured skinny jeans as Ellen has done adds a modern twist to the old &ldquo;jumper and denim jeans&rdquo; look of our youth or you can jazz up a knit jumper with a body con skirt and heeled fur trim boots as we see here on Emer.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5617\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5617\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5617\" title=\"2\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"303\" /></a>\n\nIf you happen not to have a granny to knit you an awesome jumper, why not join the Trinity KnitSoc and have a bash at knitting your own? Or if you&rsquo;re like me and are inept at knitting, Asos have the perfect solution with these reasonably priced alternatives.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5624\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5624\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5624\" title=\"5\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"222\" height=\"281\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>\n</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>All available in Asos</em>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5622\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5622\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5622\" title=\"3\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"223\" height=\"283\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5623\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5623\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5623\" title=\"4\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"222\" height=\"283\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #88396e;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Christmas Jumper</span></strong></span></h4>\nYou&rsquo;ve seen the ads on tv, Brown Thomas have converted their top floor to a winter wonderland, <a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5633\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5633\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5633 alignright\" title=\"7\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"403\" /></a> the Toy Show hype has begun; that&rsquo;s right folks, Christmas is well and truly coming. With Christmas of course comes the Christmas jumper and in my eyes, the more ludicras(tmas), the better. If flashing LED Chritmas tree jumpers aren&rsquo;t your thing however, you can always incorporate the winter theme into your jumper with a more subtle fairisle pattern like Sarah or even something with deer frolicking accross, just for good measure.\n\nIf it&rsquo;s gaudy you want, look no further than <a href=\"http://www.funkychristmasjumpers.com\">www.funkychristmasjumpers.com</a> that\u00a0have a simply wonderful collection of tacky Chritmas jumpers. If it is subtlty you&rsquo;re going for in these chilly times however, ASOS again has provided us with some great winter inspired cardis and jumpers, and even a knit skirt for those more adventurous!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5642\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5642\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5642 alignleft\" title=\"9\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"230\" height=\"292\" /></a>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5643\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5643\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5643\" title=\"10\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"230\" height=\"292\" /></a>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #88396e;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Cape</span></strong></span></h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5651\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5651\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5651\" title=\"13\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/131-224x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"224\" height=\"300\" /></a>The cape, the ultimate &lsquo;tween seasons coat, gives you the perfect transition between Autunm and Winter. It&rsquo;s not quite a coat aesthetically but it still provides all the warmth you need in these Autumnal months. Having been all over the fashion scene last winter they are making a come back this year. Although this time around they are leaning more towards the fur trimmed, sheepskin variety, you can still see many of the military-esque versions in the shops and indeed around our fair college. Jenny shows us how to pull off this look by matching her trousers to the trim on her cape and pairing with a vintage satchel in tan and a deep green checkered scarf staying true to the season.\n\nASOS hits the nail on the head again with this trend with their wide selection of capes for this season including these two great takes on the basic form yet both with its own unique twist.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5653\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5653\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-5653 alignleft\" title=\"15\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/15-236x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"270\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5663\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5663\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5663\" title=\"14\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/141-235x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"212\" height=\"270\" /></a>\n<h4><span style=\"color: #88396e;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The &ldquo;Barbour&rdquo;</span></strong></span></h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5670\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5670\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-5670 alignright\" title=\"16\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/16-171x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"171\" height=\"300\" /></a>You really can&rsquo;t go wrong with a jacket fit for the Queen, or Alexa Chung for that matter. Originally having been the type of thing your parents wore to rubgy matches when you were a kid, these iconic British jackets have burst onto the fashion scene in the past two years or so being made famous through celebrity festival style. Whether it&rsquo;s waxed or padded, a Barbour jacket is the ultimate Autumn coat giving not only warmth but also a waterproof layer that so many coats these days seem to lack. Living in Ireland, this is a real plus. Zarah was the epitomy of classic British style in her olive green waxed version, chunky knit scarf and the sweetest English accent to top off the look. You don&rsquo;t have to be a member of Team England to pull off a Barbour these days though, Penney&rsquo;s have recently started to stock pretty resonable knock-offs at an even more resonable price but if it is the real thing you&rsquo;re after, before forking out hundreds, take a look around second hand shops. I picked up a navy padded Barbour jacket in London&rsquo;s Brick Lane market for a tenner, albeit it is child&rsquo;s size, but if the glove fits!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5673\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5673\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5673 alignleft\" title=\"17\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/17.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"233\" height=\"233\" /></a><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5674\" title=\"19\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/19-206x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"185\" height=\"270\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #88396e;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Parka</span></strong></span></h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5694\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5694\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5694\" title=\"22\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/22-166x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"166\" height=\"300\" /></a>Originally a jacket worn in the Arctic, the parka became famous in the 90s due to bands like Oasis and the &ldquo;mod&rdquo; scene. This oversized army style jacket, usually in olive green hasn&rsquo;t changed much since the days when the Gallagher brothers donned them on stage but now you&rsquo;re more likely to see them being worn by women after this season&rsquo;s catwalks seeing parka designs from high end labels like Alexander Wang, Jean Paul Gaultier and Vera Wang. Sarah ties her fur trimmed parka into her outfit with a floral top with similarly coloured blossoms.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5695\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5695\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5695\" title=\"21\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/21.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"384\" height=\"317\" /></a></p>\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #88396e; font-weight: bold;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The &ldquo;Cutesie&rdquo; Coat</span></strong></span>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5702\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5702\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5702\" title=\"24\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/24.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"234\" height=\"383\" /></a>Think Madeline, think little girl in Shindler&rsquo;s list, think English Grammar School uniform, think button down, high neck, neck bows, fur trim and clean cuts; these coats are timeless and they are popping up all over the high street. You have only to walk into the coat section in Topshop at the moment to see what I mean. If you can put a velvet pussy-bow on a silk shirt then why not on a coat?! If big bows are a bit too &ldquo;cutesie&rdquo; for you however, how can still achieve this look with a contrasting fur trim collar and staement button-down front. Lauren brightens up these winter days in her coral take on this look with white fur trim and the essential high neckline.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5703\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5703\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5703\" title=\"25\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/25-200x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5704\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5704\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-5704\" title=\"26\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/26.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"233\" height=\"295\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #88396e; font-weight: bold;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Duffle Coat</span></strong></span>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5709\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5709\"><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-5709\" title=\"27\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/27.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"235\" height=\"333\" /></a>Like the parka, the duffle coat is unisex and is being seen all over the land of celeb at present as well as featuring heavily on this season&rsquo;s\u00a0&ldquo;Fall&rdquo; catwalks. Plus, anything that has Paddington Bear&rsquo;s seal of approval is alright with this writer. Whether you go for the original &ldquo;Paddington&rdquo; like Alan, or change things up a little in pillar-box red with lips to match, you&rsquo;re sure to be fashinable toasty this season.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMale duffle coats seen on this season&rsquo;s catwalks.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5710\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5710\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-5710 aligncenter\" title=\"29\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/29.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"291\" height=\"542\" /></a></p>\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #88396e; font-weight: bold;\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Fur Coat</span></strong></span>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5721\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5721\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5721\" title=\"30\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/30.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"248\" height=\"406\" /></a>Possibly the most contraversial coat of all time, the fur coat is something that splits the fashion world adn has seen red paint being thrown on many a celebrity by PETA activists. Now this article isn&rsquo;t about whether it&rsquo;s right or wrong to wear fur, but if you ask me, as long as it&rsquo;s faux, it&rsquo;s fabulous! You really can&rsquo;t find much more glamourours than a fur coat. The movie stars of the fifties knew it and they are renowned for being some of the most glamourous and stylish of our time. Their coats may have been real fur alright, but with new materials available these days, it is possibly to get the same look without the cruelty.\n\nSarah brings her fur up-to-date with\u00a0 paor of floral skinnies and converse.\n\nIf it&rsquo;s fur glam you&rsquo;re looking for this winter, look no further than Topshop. This season sees some of the most outraveous Cruella DeVille inspired looks as well as some uber girlie, legally blonde typed pink ones. (wow, I just said uber, I need to stop writing fashion articles, or at least find some new adjectives.)\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5734\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5734\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-5734\" title=\"31\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/311-200x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"270\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5735\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5735\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-5735 alignnone\" title=\"32\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/321-201x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"181\" height=\"270\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, whether it&rsquo;s your granny&rsquo;s knitting, &ldquo;that&rdquo; Christmas jumper, a versitle cape, a trusty Barbour, a parka \u00e1 la Oasis, an ode to Madeline, a &ldquo;Paddington Bear&rdquo; or 50&rsquo;s glam you&rsquo;re after, look no further than your fellow Trinity students for ideas on how to keep warm this winter.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>", "Imageurl": "5744", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5596", "Heading": "Wrap up Warm!"}
