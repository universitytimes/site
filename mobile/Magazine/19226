{"Body": "Back to college, and goodbye to Summer. As we bid farewell to our sandals and sundresses, we greet our beloved jumpers and jeans with open arms. However, whether you&rsquo;re starting third-level education for the first time or coming back for some more fun, a wardrobe revamp may be in order. Maybe you should cast a fresh eye over your clothes and donate or sell anything you think you&rsquo;ll never wear again. This will create room for new wardrobe items, and although a shopping spree is a great idea, the necessary funds are not usually on the cards for students. Fear not, fashion-lovers, help is at hand. There a few charity and vintage shops that won&rsquo;t break the bank but will allow you to showcase your style through pre-loved clothes.\r\n\r\nCharity shops are enjoyable to peruse as you never know exactly what you&rsquo;re going to find. Whether it be a designer jacket or a crazy Christmas jumper, anything could be hidden between the many racks of clothes. Shops found on George&rsquo;s Street and Rathmines are some of my favourites. The St. Vincent de Paul shop on George&rsquo;s Street is especially good as it&rsquo;s unusually big for a charity store and has nicely lit dressing rooms. George&rsquo;s St. Arcade and the surrounding area boasts a number of quirky stalls and shops, stocked full of vintage wears. A favourite of mine is Om Diva, located on Drury St., as the staff are always friendly and willing to help you pick out one-off vintage or revamped pieces.\r\n\r\nTemple Bar is always going to be a key area to visit when looking for some college fashion. Lucy&rsquo;s Lounge can be found here, painted bright pink and packed with vintage items. Venturing downstairs, you&rsquo;ll discover an Aladdin&rsquo;s cave of affordable, cute clothes. You&rsquo;ll also uncover quirky jewellery and hats that add interest to any outfit.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get the best out of second hand shopping, it&rsquo;s a good idea to remember a few tips:\r\n<ol>\n<li>Most places only deal in cash so remember to take some money out. This is also a handy way to stick to a certain budget.</li>\n<li>Try things on. Sizes usually aren&rsquo;t written or may be mislabeled on some vintage items.</li>\n<li>Bring an honest friend. They&rsquo;ll let you know if your new look works.</li>\n<li>If you love something, get it straight away or ask if you can put it on hold. There&rsquo;s usually new stock coming in daily, \u00a0so the item you like may be snapped up if you don&rsquo;t act on it fast!</li>\n<li>Although it may be a charity shop, you are a student, so try your hand at haggling if the product is damaged in any way. You may be surprised at your newfound bartering techniques, but always remain polite; this isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;The Apprentice&rsquo; so no making sales assistants cry!</li>\n<li>Finally, take your time! Rummaging will become one of your special skills by the end of the year.</li>\n</ol>\r\nHappy hunting!", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/vintage-article.png", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19226", "Heading": "Student Vintage"}
