Before he was doing solo work, Ernest Wilson used to be a leading member in The Clarendonians and although he&rsquo;s not making music any more, tracks like &ldquo;I Know Myself&rdquo; are still making people smile.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/wichita-recordings/cloud-nothings-stay-useless\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cloud Nothings &ndash; Stay Useless</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After previewing a new album last week, we&rsquo;re revisiting Cloud Nothings great 2012 record, Attack on Memory. Their lovable indie rock has managed to stay fresh for the past three years so lets hope the new album manages to achieve the same.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMFxNYpG5uM\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Zed Bias &ndash; Luther</p>\r\nHaving released his debut album on SWAMP81 last week, garage legend Zed Bias has been the mainstay of our listening pleasures. Although it has still not been released, the magnificently upbeat &ldquo;Luther&rdquo; can be found on YouTube through a radio rip of a Giles Peterson show.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Road.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23050", "Heading": "What We're Listening To: 5"}
