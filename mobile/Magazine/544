The likes of Shirley Temple and Gene Kelly could sing, dance and act, sure, but they didn&rsquo;t have their own fragrances &ndash; or clothing lines.

Together with Paris-based creative collective, &lsquo;Surface to Air&rsquo;, they&rsquo;ve designed a limited collection of menswear and christened it &lsquo;S2A X KOL&rsquo;. Originally the collection was exclusive to the Danish store &lsquo;Paris Texas&rsquo; , but it will be available in the UK in &lsquo;The Shop&rsquo; at King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea, London and in select stores across the US later this month.</p>\n<p>As a whole, the line is pretty up-to-date and wearable. The twelve piece collection consists of flannel shirts in mostly red and green, t-shirts, a leather jacket, patchwork drain-pipe jeans, a black fedora, boots, a woven belt, a scarf, guitar straps and a red bandana (because everyone needs one of those!). The shirts and denim aren&rsquo;t half bad and reflect well the band&rsquo;s cool, chilled Americana look.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, take a closer look at the price tag and you may feel rather nauseous or, indeed, inclined to walk away. Unless you&rsquo;re fortunate enough to have particularly generous parents or an exceptionally large bank account, chances are you won&rsquo;t be dying to throw away &euro;120 on a flannel shirt or &euro;130 on a scarf any time soon. Yet these are the hefty sums that are expected to lure us in. Maybe the stomach-churning figures could be justified if the pieces were made of cashmere or silk, but alas, they&rsquo;re not.

If the likes of Giorgio Armani or Vivienne Westwood were to suddenly announce that they were going to pursue careers in music, there would be many-a brow raised. Not only that, there would be absolute pandemonium from the many millions of self-declared avid music fans out there. This can be seen by the fact that wearing a band t-shirt in the company of music junkies tends to attract such questions as &lsquo;Do you even know any of their songs?&rsquo;, &lsquo;Do you know anything about them?&rsquo;, &lsquo;When&rsquo;s the last time you listened to their album?&rsquo; and my personal favourite, &lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t wear it just for the sake of wearing it or because it looks nice. It&rsquo;s about the music, not the shirt.&rsquo; No matter, the celebrities of today continue on their bold adventures into the world of fashion design.</p>\n<p>I suppose in attempting to fathom what exactly it is that motivates these stars to go forth and create their own lines, one can look to Liam Gallagher of Oasis who started his own collection, &lsquo;Pretty Green&rsquo;, in 2005, for guidance:</p>\n<p>&lsquo;Clothes and music are my passion. I&rsquo;m not doing it to rip anyone off and I&rsquo;m not doing it for the money either. I&rsquo;m doing it &lsquo;cause there&rsquo;s a lack of stuff out there of the things I would wear.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Apparently there&rsquo;s a lack of plain t-shirts and oddly shaped trench-like coats.

As much as one may wish to answer in the affirmative, the wide availability of these types of garments across the globe is irrefutable. Furthermore, if they were responding to an emergency crisis, they would not even consider charging nearly &euro;100 for a black belt!</p>\n<p>Bono and Ali Hewson deserve a mention too. They, with the help of the denim label &lsquo;Rogan&rsquo; embarked on the project that is &lsquo;Edun&rsquo;, a line of men and women&rsquo;s wear made entirely from organic materials. This line is pretty laid-back and casual. Granted that materials such as organic cotton are used and that it aims to promote a sustainable social alternative in cotton producing countries, it&rsquo;s still quite pricey.</p>\n<p>If celebrities are so uninterested in making money, why then is Edun a profit-making company? Why doesn&rsquo;t all the money go back into the communities which are being helped?

Just a thought...</p>\n<p>There are countless others who have ventured on similar quests for world domination.
