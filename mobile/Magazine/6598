I for one had passed it countless times on my way to Rays Pizza and other favoured spots in Temple Bar and yet never once thought to check it out. If it wasn&rsquo;t for my friend inexplicably winning two free tickets to a magic show there, perhaps I would have never gone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\" align=\"center\">The show was called the &ldquo;Secret Castle of Magic&rdquo; and I have to say as a confused bunch of us sat outside the closed doors of the museum, it did certainly feel mysterious and secretive. My friend and I had sprinted there thinking we were late and that we might have missed the beginning of the show and yet there everyone was, sitting outside the doors all doubting that they had got the date and time right. Eventually all was revealed as the heavy double doors opened and a creepy monstrous figure appeared urging us in. Initially no-one moved as no-one wanted to be the first to pass this bizarre character and walk into the creepy surroundings. Of course eventually someone did and then immediately everyone entered into a frantic frenzy to get to the top of the queue and elbowed each other in the wild rush to show tickets. We were met by assistants clad all in black and sporting white sinister masks who pointed towards the way and said not a word, adding to the suspense and tension. It was then that the magic begun as one of the assistants stepped forward and presented himself as our magician for the evening. I found his show thoroughly amusing and engaging as he entertained us with endless tricks and wacky illusions. His set was very audience interactive and many of us were invited up on stage at various points and used to play important parts in his magical games.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After this stimulating experience, it was time for an interlude so he led us downstairs to where all the max models live and suggested that at night, they come alive and roam free. A silly idea but the thought of the Mary Robinson statue having a conversation with Elvis or Freddie Cougar amused me greatly. The Wax Museum is certainly no Madame Taussauds but it did have some very cool attractions and sights inside. From the Hall of Irish Legends, to the Chamber of Horrors all the way through to the colourful and dazzling Children&rsquo;s Fantasy World where I spent far too long for a near 20 year old. I even sat through the entire puppet show very happily. I also particularly enjoyed the top floor where they had a fully equipped music studio where you could record your own songs and make a music video by superimposing yourself into an array of funky backgrounds. I really do hope they delete the footage me dancing around like a deranged animal on speed. After a pleasant break of wine and cookies in the Museum&rsquo;s charming little caf\u00e9, we were welcomed back into Grand Hall of the Museum by an eccentric comedian/magician for another amusing magic show.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I would really recommend <em>The Secret Castle of Magic</em> as it is such good, clean fun although the ticket prices are quite steep. I had a wonderful evening but perhaps would not have enjoyed it quite so much if I had paid the full 25 Euros for the show. This one-off experience at the Wax Museum really reminded me of how exciting professional magic acts can be &ndash; I really had forgotten all the fun I once had as a child marvelling at magicians and to be honest, now I would love to see more magic in Dublin in the future.</p>", "Imageurl": "6601", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6598", "Heading": "A Night at the Wax Museum"}
