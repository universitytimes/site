Set up by FMC and Wrong Tape Speed in 2003 as a show-case for emerging Irish musical talent, HWCH has gone from strength to strength, and has long since established its place on Dublin&rsquo;s musical calendar. There&rsquo;s also a lot to do other than go to gigs over the coming days, including free(!) day-conventions on music technology (Meet the Geeks),as well as panel interviews with bookers from international festivals like SXSW and Camden Crawl. Here&rsquo;s a small selection of the plethora of bands over the coming nights&hellip;\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>Moths, Saturday 10.15 &ndash; 10.45, The Workman&rsquo;s Club.</strong>\n\nMoths, aka Jack Colleran, has seen his fan base swell over the course of the year, the Kildare man&rsquo;s brilliant brand of &lsquo;lo-fi electronica&rsquo; striking a chord with many a blogger. With acclaimed sets at Castlepalooza and the Body &amp; Soul arena at Electric Picnic, his will no doubt be one of the most anticipated sets of the weekend. One particularly hysterical fan claims in a Youtube comment that <em>Heart</em> helped him come to terms with losing his leg in a horrible unicycle accident. He could also lay claim to the best Facebook status I&rsquo;ve ever seen: &ldquo;Today has been mental. Got my Leaving Cert results and signed the contract for a recording deal with a major label all in the one day. Lets goooooooo&rdquo;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4mQw0x1_lI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Come On Live Long, Saturday, 8.00 &ndash; 8.30pm, The Grand Social. </strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFormed only a year ago, Come On Live Long marry dream-like synths with acoustic guitars and ukelele to create their own, alluring sound. The two tracks on their debut, self-titled EP, are most promising indeed. The brooding <em>Animal</em> stands out, beginning low-key with solo ukelele and falsetto vocals, giving way to a euphoric, synth led chorus. Their follow up EP, recorded with Adebesi Shank producers Eoin Whitfield and James Eager is currently being mastered, and will be released in the coming months.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"100\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; width: 400px; height: 100px;\" src=\"http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=2236818/size=venti/bgcol=FFFFFF/linkcol=4285BB/\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"><a><strong>Spies, Thursday 9.00 &ndash; 9.30, Button Factory.</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMaking their HWCH debut, this Dundrum band have created quite a stir since their conception. Spies have been gigging prolifically of late since a Summer that included an appearance at the inaugural Forbidden Fruit festival, where they attracted a substantial crowd. Their <em>Liars Call Me King</em> EP was released in October 2010 and their most recent single, <em>Barricade</em>, was awarded single of the fortnight in Hotpress earlier this year. Songs like the atmospheric <em>Fill The Silence</em> and stand-out <em>Weaker Body</em> have led to inevitable comparisons to The National, but singer Michael Broderick&rsquo;s soaring vocals couldn&rsquo;t be further from Matt Berninger&rsquo;s baritone delivery. A new EP will be released in the coming months.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n</a></iframe><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/26891654?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitAllowFullScreen\" allowfullscreen=\"allowFullScreen\"></iframe><p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/26891654\">Rockin Through A Cube</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/spies\">spies</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>Cloud Castle Lake, Saturday 9.30 &ndash; 10.00pm, The Workman&rsquo;s Club.</strong>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n\nWinning a place opening the weekend at Stradbally in 2010&rsquo;s Pick for the Picnic contest, Cloud Castle Lake have established themselves as one of Dublin&rsquo;s most ambitious and interesting bands. Their Facebook blurb claims that their music is influenced by &lsquo;film, literature and real life&rsquo;, perhaps accounting for the dynamic sprawling nature of some of their work. Particularly apparent are allusions to Radiohead&rsquo;s more ambitious oeuvre, not least in singer Daniel McCauley&rsquo;s vocals. No bad thing. Since curating their own Crawdaddy gig in March, the four-piece have been busy working on their eagerly anticipated debut album. In the meantime, their cover of Kanye&rsquo;s Lost In The World, a collaboration with members of Trinity Orchestra, is worth a look. (&ldquo;Who will survive in the Republic?!&rdquo;)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_brKkaOCarY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Spies, Thursday 9.00 &ndash; 9.30, Button Factory.</strong>\n\nMaking their HWCH debut, this Dundrum band have created quite a stir since their conception.

Theirs is a poppy, summery sound, as displayed in singles <em>Radio</em> and <em>Shelf Life</em>. Fittingly, they played almost every Irish festival this summer, including the main stage at our very own Trinity Ball. Brothers Daniel, Shane and Oisin Cluskey launched their debut album <em>People Street</em> in Whelans last Friday, and will follow their HWCH appearance by continuing their\u00a0 nationwide tour with former Blizzards frontman Bressie.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<iframe width=\"400\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wA1fv4bkvow\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "4960", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4959", "Heading": "The Hard Working Class Heroes Festival 2011"}
