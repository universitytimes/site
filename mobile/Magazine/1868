AGM on Wednesday.\n\nMarc will be filling the role previously held by Matt Smyth, who has really helped the society to develop this year in what many consider to be one of its most successful years in recent memory.\u00a0 Matt has helped orchestrate several notable appearances from esteemed actors including Alan Rickman and Fiona Shaw as well as being instrumental in organising the inaugural Oscar Wilde Festival which proved to be a huge success.\n\nHowever Marc seems adequately equipped to step into the void left by Matt&rsquo;s departure with both a vast array of experience and a raft of new ideas to constantly improve upon the society&rsquo;s recent success which he has credited to the &ldquo;sterling work&rdquo; of the departing committee.\u00a0 Indeed society seems to be the operative word in some of Marc&rsquo;s plans for the growth and development of Players with a vision of Players being seen as something more than just a theatre but rather a society which has something to offer everyone from directing to acting to technical work or simply coming to watch productions.\u00a0 This vision seems to build upon Matt Smyth&rsquo;s efforts to help Players reach a wider audience this year, something which he has readily achieved.\n\nIndeed it is this wider audience that Players now reaches that Atkinson hopes to exploit to help develop the society during his year at the helm by reaching out into the wider Dublin artistic community.\u00a0 With a vision of using previous Players members who now find themselves in positions within the Dublin theatre community to hold master-classes and workshops as well as to help directors on individual projects, he seeks to move beyond what has been traditionally done by the society in an effort to maintain and improve production values in the shows produced by the society.\n\nHowever this reaching out to a wider community doesn&rsquo;t simply involve improving production values, it is also about nurturing new writing talent within the society which has been shown to be in abundance this semester with several productions of original pieces.\u00a0 This desire to reach out to the wider community may also foster a sense of the society being something more than just a theatre with Atkinson hoping to gain monthly cheap or free tickets to some of the theatrical productions around Dublin.\n\nHowever despite these lofty goals for continual improvement, Atkinson will still have to tackle the continued criticism that has been level against Players, that it is a clique.\u00a0 However he &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t buy&rdquo;
