Although they may have gained international recognition through their song &ldquo;Clouds on the Moon&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s their 1983 hit &ldquo;Messages From the Stars&rdquo; which really stands out. Hewson&rsquo;s crisp production and intergalactic rhythms sound as good as ever even after thirty years.</p>\n<b></b><b>\u00a0</b>\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/prescription-pr/girl-band-lawman\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Girl Band &ndash; Lawman</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: left; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">one to watch for 2014</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Absolutely fantastic song from Dublin based rockers Girl Band. Released on Another City Records, &ldquo;Lawman&rdquo; radiates the sound of early Sebadoh while also adding in a slight flare of Bleach-era Nirvana. Despite these comparisons Girl Band sound refreshingly original and are most certainly one to watch for 2014.</p>\n<b></b><b>\u00a0</b>\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/recogn1zereal/pusha-t-suicide-feat-ab-liva\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pusha T &ndash; Suicide</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">&ldquo;Fraud n****s you Zoolander, Ben Stiller&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since the rumours of a Clipse reunion have been quashed, we&rsquo;ve had to make do with relistening to Pusha T&rsquo;s 2013 album, My Name Is My Name. While not being Pusha&rsquo;s best work, the album still contains some absolute gems, one of them being the hard-hitting &ldquo;Suicide&rdquo;. Along with a fantastic beat, the track also contains some of Pusha&rsquo;s funniest lines, including &ldquo;Fraud n****s you Zoolander, Ben Stiller&rdquo;.</p>\n<b></b><b>\u00a0</b>\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/polishcutouts/ptaki-krystyna\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ptaki &ndash; Krystyna</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: left; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">beautifully chopped vocals and smooth bassline make it a joy to listen to and leave one craving the summer sun</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Normally not being a man who enjoys Disco edits, this Polish re-fix may have to be the one exception. Standing at over seven minutes long, &ldquo;Krystyna&rdquo; is most definitely a slow burner. Despite this, the beautifully chopped vocals and smooth bassline of Ptaki&rsquo;s edit make it a joy to listen to and leave one craving the summer sun.</p>\n<b></b><b>\u00a0</b>\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNqzw6acJVo\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">GG DOOM &ndash; Jive Turkeys</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">Grip Grand has created a beat resembling those found on Doomsday and Mm Food</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although not an official track, YouTube music star Grip Grand has skilfully managed to make &ldquo;Jive Turkeys&rdquo; sound like a legitimate MF DOOM song. Taking vocals from a Jonathon Toth track featuring the masked villain, Grip Grand has created a beat resembling those found on Doomsday and Mm Food. Grip has also made a video for the song containing clips of the old Fantastic Four cartoon.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/dj-decks.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24183", "Heading": "What We&rsquo;re Listening To: 6"}
