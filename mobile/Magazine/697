Tip of the ice-berg.</p>\n<p>Your night begins with a daunting but colourful queue, jam-packed with your favourite stereotypes &ndash; rugger buggers and their scrummies, tangoed goons sporting deliberately dishevelled blondeness and an abundance of Bambi-on-ice legs tottering about next to those of the &ldquo;older professionals&rdquo; out for a quiet prowl among Team England and an embarrassing amount of Trinity College&rsquo;s student body. Having spent your introduction to palace among these little treats for what feels like hours you are then greeted with the delightful bouncers. Rough would indeed be an understatement. With your heart in your mouth hoping you&rsquo;ve met all the requirements to be allowed in &ndash; 20 or over, &ldquo;smokin&rsquo; hot&rdquo; and damn lucky because regardless of your age or looks, you might just get rejected for no apparent reason or because you&rsquo;re &ldquo;too drunk&rdquo;.

Seeing as you cannot avail of the convenience of paying by laser because, no, that&rsquo;s not allowed, you have to queue up at Palace&rsquo;s special money machine which often only dispenses fifty euro notes. Not exactly a cheap night out considering its usually swamped with students. Two queues down, now to actually get that drink you wanted, oh, an hour ago. Another queue at the bar where you&rsquo;ll shell out another arm or leg for an abomination of a drink, only to drink it at a rapid rate so you can get to dance-floor for your favourite song! Unless of course you have taste, in which case, this would not be your reaction to the Palace playlist which has been compared to that of Coppers. What an honour.</p>\n<p>On asking various Palace Princes and Princesses what the appeal of this seemingly rubbish night out was, the responses were somewhat amusing. One girl, so orange I genuinely thought she had a disease, reported that it was &ldquo;all the hot men buying me drinks!&rdquo; while another insisted it was &ldquo;the chandeliers! They&rsquo;re so shiny...&rdquo; However, the general consensus from the girls was that they enjoyed the cheesy tunes and splashing out on a few cocktails for the weekend. Fair enough. We can all understand the appeal of expensive drinks along to a good old sing-along to Abba. Can&rsquo;t we? The boys had a very different attitude. One enormous, presumably rugby-orientated, bloke made an interesting observation that &ldquo;Palace is huge.&rdquo; I sensed he may have suffered from a size-complex so I questioned him no further. What is the appeal of a giant nightclub full of people, most of which you probably don&rsquo;t know?
