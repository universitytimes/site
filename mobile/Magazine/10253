A handful of half decent headliners, throw up a few tents, do a hype video and they think they&rsquo;ll have us all paying 80 euro a ticket? Have they read the papers lately? I&rsquo;m screwed, you&rsquo;re screwed, the whole country is feckin&rsquo; screwed. This is probably going to be your last Trinity Ball ever. You&rsquo;re going to be singing &ldquo;Waltzing Matilda&rdquo; in Melbourne or &ldquo;99 Red Balloons&rdquo; (or whatever the the German national anthem is) this time next year. We need a plan. We need a party. We need to go out with a bang, something to tell the Enkelkinder about. Let&rsquo;s blow the lot on Trinity Ball 2012 because Enda is not going to be thinking &ldquo;let&rsquo;s make a good headliner for the Trinity Ball an non-negotiable&rdquo; when negotiating bailout numero deux with the troika. It&rsquo;s time for a ball, a real ball and I know exactly what to do.\n\nFirst, we need cash. Let&rsquo;s sell off all our unique disposable assets. The Book of Kells, Cobblestones and Aaron Heffernan should all raise a few quid. We must have a degree-printing machine somewhere around campus. We can use to this our advantage. Unemployed, no qualifications and barely a handful of brain cells but a rake of cash under the bed, Trinity College would love to have you. Medical degrees printed off for 2 grand a pop, English degrees for &euro;500 and Business &amp; Computing degrees for less then the price of the paper it&rsquo;s written on. No brainer. Why stop there? We should charge for the use of the Campanile to play advertising jingles every hour on hour. Why the hell didn&rsquo;t we sell the naming rights of the Pav before? I&rsquo;d love to have a few Bav in the Rabo Direct Lounge. Remember that contraption they had down by the Science Gallery that made words out of water? Let&rsquo;s sell that to Coca Cola and just have it saying &ldquo;Drink Coke&rsquo; over and over again. We should have a good few million at this stage. Just to top it off let&rsquo;s sell the nursing building (sure it&rsquo;s miles off campus and they&rsquo;re all in Coppers anyway), rent out the Old Library for a few raves and tell all the residents on campus to vacate their apartments so we can get a few quid off the tourists in the springtime. Now, by my calculations, if everyone plays ball, we should have &euro;37.4 million. It&rsquo;s time to have some fun.\n\nTickets. Let&rsquo;s cut out the messing. Everyone is getting a ticket in Trinity this year. I don&rsquo;t care if you don&rsquo;t know the front side of a dress suit from your own backside. You&rsquo;re having a ticket thrust into your claw for this year&rsquo;s ball, on the house. It&rsquo;s your last ball; you might as well come along. Now for headliners, with &euro;37.4 million fumbling around in our back pocket we can probably afford to splash the cash a little bit. Beyonc\u00e9, I don&rsquo;t care that you want to spend time with your newborn, that&rsquo;s nothing 5 million can&rsquo;t sort out. Bon Iver, I know you just won two Grammy&rsquo;s so you&rsquo;re not exactly as ALT as you once were. Still though you might pop over to see us for a million. Jack White, we know you&rsquo;ve disbanded the White Stripes, but for &euro;3 million, do you think you&rsquo;d be persuaded to give it another go? Same question to James Murphy re: LCD Soundsystem. U2 loves money, you can pop along for &euro;4 million, just bring your 360 stage with you okay? Coldplay, don&rsquo;t really like you but sure if you&rsquo;re in town and you want two million, we can throw you into the mix. Calvin Harris, for 100k you can do a DJ set beside the queue for the jacks. James Vincent McMurrow you can busk on the way in for 10k. Jessie J, in the words of The Rubberbandits in a recent interview, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve no tits anyway&rdquo; so you can feck off. Grand, line up sorted.\n\nThe night itself. As you receive your complementary party bus to the venue you will go through a security check to make sure your carrying at least a shoulder. If not, you will receive, on the spot, an emergency naggin to tide you over. We&rsquo;ll divide the tents into ways we actually assess acts. The Mainstream tent, where acts that everybody knows play songs that all sound the same and everyone feels like a Hotpress critic such is their deep understanding of the lyrics in a song where the chorus is repeated 17 times the ALT tent where no band will actually play but if they did play you wouldn&rsquo;t have been there because by reading this article your not ALT enough to attend, sorry. The Power Nap tent, need a quick forty winks to get you through the night just pop over here where we will also guarantee the spoon from someone decidedly more attractive then you are. The &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not big yet but they might be, but they probably won&rsquo;t be&rdquo; tent here you can find all those acts that are probably shit but might just not be in one handy spot. Throw in guys indiscriminately handing out 50-euro notes (66, yeah?), a free bar and slides to take you from one tent to the next and we&rsquo;re sorted.\n\nOnce the night is finished, you&rsquo;ll receive a chicken fillet roll, another naggin for old times sake and some young fresher who we convinced you&rsquo;re the manager of the headline act. Let&rsquo;s make this dream a reality. It&rsquo;s only a bit of red tape stopping us, that and &euro;37.4 million. At least now we have something tangible to demand from next year&rsquo;s Ents Officer.", "Imageurl": "10254", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10253", "Heading": "The Ultimate Ball Experience"}
