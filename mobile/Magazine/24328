After attending high school in the US, he returned to Brazil to study and soon after began his career as a journalist and photographer. In 2009, Rafael and his childhood friend Jaime Portas Vilaseca created the expedition company, <i>Miramundos</i>. This business became a national success and the business has expanded to include expeditions across South America and Europe, with Rafael recording these impressive trips along the way. The goal and driving force behind <i>Miramundos</i> is to inspire the common man and to illustrate how a person&rsquo;s dreams of adventure are easily achievable.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ANGKOR-WAT-CAMBODIA-MEN-AND-NATURE-RAFAEL-DUARTE.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"ANGKOR WAT - CAMBODIA - MEN AND NATURE - RAFAEL DUARTE\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/ANGKOR-WAT-CAMBODIA-MEN-AND-NATURE-RAFAEL-DUARTE-1024x682.jpg\" width=\"980\" height=\"652\" /></a>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: left; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">While hugely popular here in Ireland, they were in the first two Brazilian journalists to record their journey on the pilgrimage</blockquote>\r\nRafael and Jaime&rsquo;s most recent <i>Miramundos </i>adventure together was a mammoth cycling expedition, retracing the\u00a0<i>Estrada Real</i> through the heart of Brazil. The team had previously undertaken a similar style trip a bit closer to Ireland. Their first <i>Miramundos </i>trip was to tackle the entire length of the original French route on <i>El Camino de Santiago</i>. While hugely popular here in Ireland, they were in the first two Brazilian journalists to record their journey on the pilgrimage. Their blog and photography coverage proved so popular that they recently released a book detailing the trip. For Rafael, the most memorable part of the trip was the meeting of fellow travellers along the wood lined paths. This sense of camaraderie with a fellow traveller inspired him to encourage more people to take up the <i>Estrata Real</i>, in the hope of creating a similar route.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sahara.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" alt=\"Sahara\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Sahara.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" /></a>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">Even in the month of May, Morocco&rsquo;s <i>Toubkal</i> remains dusted with snow and ice, at 4,167m it is no easy climb</blockquote>\r\nRafael spent time last year in the Sahara desert in Morocco, before ascending the <i>Toubka</i>l the highest mountain in North Africa. This was a major step toward improving his climbing skills in order to able to scale higher peaks. Even in the month of May, Morocco&rsquo;s <i>Toubkal</i> remains dusted with snow and ice, at 4,167m it is no easy climb. <i>Mont Blanc</i> was the next target for Rafael, an experience which he speaks frankly about in the interview. What Rafael only revealed after the interview was that, three weeks earlier, he had been bed ridden in a Thai hospital. While traversing the jungles of South East Asia, Rafael had contracted Dengue Fever, a debilitating illness transmitted by mosquito. The stay in hospital put him behind on his training plans, forcing an increased intensity within a smaller time-frame. Upon his release from hospital, Rafael immediately restarted an even tougher training regime in order to reach the minimum fitness level for scaling Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nHear more about Rafael&rsquo;s expedition in his interview with Daire Collins here:\r\n\r\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dairecollins/rafael-duarte-interview-short\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n</div>\n</div>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/RAFAEL-DUARTE-Selfportrait-Mont-Blanc-2013.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24328", "Heading": "Explorer Extraordinaire "}
