This is not negotiable; it is as much a part of the culture as the famed Southern hospitality, serving almost anything in Jello, and Nascar. While Southerners are fond of frying pretty much anything that is edible (pickles, tomatoes, whole turkeys, steak) chicken is the most delicious, and I&rsquo;m certain that many families have been split in two by vicious feuds about whether it is best to cook it in lard or bacon grease, for how long and what sort of weather it is best to eat it in.

Fried chicken is not just a greasy guilty pleasure fit only for 3am post-nightclub hunger pains; it certainly does not deserve to be dumped in a cardboard box along with fat smeared chips. I discovered in Tennessee that when given the respect is deserves, fried chicken can be something truly marvellous.
