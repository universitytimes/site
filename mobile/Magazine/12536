It is not a <em>great </em>film, and it is most certainly not &lsquo;this decade&rsquo;s <em>The Matrix</em>&rsquo;, as numerous bus stop ads have promised me. While I relatively enjoyed my time watching this daring sci-fi film, I found it to be severely over-hyped, the film&rsquo;s positive points being blown way out of proportion. I realise I am in the minority here &ndash; the film, at the time of writing, is scoring 93% on RottenTomatoes, and the majority of the people I know enjoyed the picture greatly (indeed, our very own Oliver Nolan gave the film a 5/5 rating) &ndash; however, I feel like I have to point out the film&rsquo;s glaring flaws. While I am trying to keep the article spoiler-free, bear in mind that I will be speaking of the film&rsquo;s second half in vague terms, so if you are one of those people that like to go into a film completely blind, you would be best off saving this article for later.\n\nFirst of all, the film&rsquo;s first half does not mesh with the second half in terms of tone at all. The first half sets up a genuinely interesting sci-fi world (I loved the grimy look, as opposed to the clich\u00e9 glossy sheen that covers a lot of the genre&rsquo;s technology), complete with a good time travel mechanic and some fun action sequences. The second half, on the other hand, suddenly becomes a horror film, complete with a creepy <em>The Omen</em>-style child. Now, this wouldn&rsquo;t have been a problem in itself &ndash; the way this part of the picture is filmed is gorgeous, featuring startling imagery, unusual transitions and beautiful static shots &ndash; what bothers me is the fact that it feels like it belongs to a completely different film. This is the same problem that this summer&rsquo;s <em>Prometheus </em>faced &ndash; it also featured some great horror sequences, which didn&rsquo;t sit well amidst the generally ponderous, philosophic tone.\n\nSecondly, and we&rsquo;re veering into slight spoiler territory here, I felt like a lot of the film&rsquo;s plot points were merely red herrings that had little to do with the main story. For instance, the way Sarah&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s backstory was set up, you would have thought it would be important, that it would be a set up for some sort of big twist &ndash; but no, it had no relation to the main plot. It is a little difficult to speak about these things without mentioning spoilers, but this happened very often. Small character quirks, like Joseph Gordon-Levitt&rsquo;s character wanting to learn French, are interesting, but the reason for them is not driven home well enough. I understand why the protagonist needs to learn French in terms of character development, but this development is simply not done well enough.\n\nMy final concern with <em>Looper </em>is the fact that it simply does not make full use of the time travel aspect, and this is really disappointing. For the first twenty minutes, I was on board. I was ready to fall in love with the complex sci-fi narrative &ndash; unfortunately, all of this isn&rsquo;t used to its full extent. The themes that the film raises are noble and timeless, but they don&rsquo;t make use of the structure that the time travel plot element provides. In great time travel films, such as <em>Primer </em>and <em>Triangle</em>, the message of the film is tightly intertwined with the way the story is told &ndash; here, unfortunately, the structure is merely an afterthought, a way to tell a completely different story.\n\nI guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is that <em>Looper </em>is overly ambitious &ndash; it tries to do too many things at once, and as a result, ends up only mildly succeeding in all of them. While I enjoyed my time with the film, I wished that it could have been much more, even though it had already done a lot of things right &ndash; I just hope that Rian Johnson manages to narrow his focus down thematically for his next film, and make the masterpiece that he truly deserves.", "Imageurl": "12537", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12536", "Heading": "Looper - An Alternate Take"}
