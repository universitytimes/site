{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>Four decades since the documentary Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory first aired, few have stopped to consider what the orange-skinned factory workers, commonly known as &ldquo;Oompa-Loompas&rdquo; (although this term is now regarded as derogatory), are doing with their utterly changed lives. Following the release of a &ldquo;warts-and-all&rdquo; memoir by Graham Adams, one of the most senior workers in the plant at the height of the 1970s chocolate boom, which paints Wonka and his close associate Slugworth (who passed away some years after the documentary in prison) as sex-obsessed pederasts, the six remaining former workers have taken a multi-million euro lawsuit against their employer, citing bizarre allegations of &ldquo;chocolatey buggery&rdquo; and &ldquo;gob-stopping&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Wonka could not be reached for comment but a close friend, who asked not to be named, has admitted that he is &ldquo;taking his cocaine and seeing no one&rdquo;, holed up in the now decrepit factory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All of the living workers claim that the decades since the factory&rsquo;s demise have been filled with anguish and self-loathing, traumatised by the sick events that occurred during the boom years. Adams, 72, seems unable to control his seething rage for the man he was once forced to call &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo;. A close friend of Paul McGrath, the legendary Irish footballer, since his days volunteering as McGrath&rsquo;s sponsor in Alcoholics Anonymous in the &lsquo;90s, Adams has battled his demons successfully and says he found writing the book cathartic. &ldquo;It was a horrible period of our lives. I wouldn&rsquo;t wish it on my worst enemy,&rdquo; he confesses. &ldquo;Seven of my former colleagues committed suicide over the years and everyone else has had a hard struggle [...] Did you know that I&rsquo;m infertile?&rdquo; Wonka refused to allow anyone else to work in his factory, maintaining that he feared &ldquo;industrial espionage&rdquo;, but the tell-all book reveals that his fetish for the men&rsquo;s astonishing haircuts and sallow skin tone was a more compelling motive.</p>\n<p>Jobless and with little hope for the future, the men have turned to various pitiful methods of finding meaning in their lives. Jeff Hand, 67, who divorced from his wife many years ago, has recently fallen victim to the devastating &ldquo;legal high&rdquo; mephedrone, an increasingly popular synthetic drug which is said to produce similar feelings of euphoria to that of cocaine and ecstasy, and admits that he feels his life is like an &ldquo;empty Malteser&rdquo;. &ldquo;Wonka is a crook,&rdquo; he says, cutting himself another line of the heady powder. &ldquo;All of the fantastical sweets that he went on about in the documentary were a complete fabrication. We were the ones who had to repair the hole in the glass ceiling when he broke it with that prick Charlie. We were the ones who took the blame for the way he callously murdered and disfigured those kids who came into the factory.

Paid only in cacao beans while working in the factory, they received a risible severance package following Wonka&rsquo;s bankruptcy scandal when the huge chocolate economic bubble collapsed in the &lsquo;80s, caused by inflationary prices and numerous chocolate-related deaths. AJ Byrne, the lead singer in the group seen frequently in the documentary, released a rap single soon after resigning, attempting to cash in on his short-lived fame. &ldquo;Chocolate Dick&rdquo;, brought out under Byrne&rsquo;s alias Brother Orange, failed to make any lasting memories in the charts and was described by one critic as &ldquo;a veritable cause for another genocide&rdquo;.
