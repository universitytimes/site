{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>Today, we sat down with Emily Deakin, a Trinity student and television buff, who was eager to speak to us about reality television and the culture that surrounds it. Getting past the usual banalities, it became clear that we had found someone far more enthusiastic than we could have imagined...</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Television is a great way to unwind at the end of a hard day,&rdquo; says Emily, &ldquo;just to switch your brain off after college. I&rsquo;d say I spend a couple of hours at least in front of the box every night! It&rsquo;s the perfect way to finish my day.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Emily takes the lid off her first Calippo of the day, blithely winding her tongue around the frozen, orange confection. As we continue to talk, Emily seems only delighted to speak about her favourite TV shows.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot on at the moment, but my primary viewing is the X Factor, probably. Obviously it gets a lot of criticism, but I don&rsquo;t see the problem with it. It&rsquo;s just entertainment, at the end of the day, I think everyone knows that. I mean, Jedward were just taking the piss out of the whole thing, showing it up for the popcorn viewing that it is, not the serious competition some people see it as. I wish they hadn&rsquo;t been voted off.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This vague allusion to &ldquo;some people&rdquo; seems a bit condescending; we ask her to elaborate. With a shrug of her shoulders, she assures us she doesn&rsquo;t mean any offense.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I mean, clearly it&rsquo;s lowest common denominator television, but if you&rsquo;re aware of that then it&rsquo;s no big deal. I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with everyone watching it,&rdquo; she continues, placing special emphasis on everyone, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s interesting to see the public reaction to it. I find it interesting how wrapped up and attached people get to the characters, and that&rsquo;s part of the fun for me.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Emily is clearly a girl with a real social conscience. She seems to have an awareness that is lost on the &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; to whom she has referred. She drinks the melted Calippo juice that has accumulated at the bottom of the tube before continuing, relating to us her theories of casual spectatorship amongst the collective:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The majority of people just sit there and absorb what they see on TV. You have to remain conscious of it at all times, then you can watch whatever you want. For example, I know that I can watch I&rsquo;m A Celebrity... or Strictly Come Dancing because I can maintain an critical distance. It&rsquo;s just a question of knowing.&rdquo; She places special emphasis on knowing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Emily seems to know an awful lot. With her enthusiasm for critical engagement in mind, we prod her to continue:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t understand that there&rsquo;s a relationship between the media and society as a whole, particularly television. Even conventional programmes with a mainstream target audience should always aim to be progressive! Look at Sex and the City, for instance: it&rsquo;s so popular, but it still has a really valid socio-political message.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>We ask her to elaborate on this...</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Representations of women have traditionally been tied to gender stereotyping, but with Sex and the City, those conventions were subverted. There&rsquo;s no reason why women can&rsquo;t be independent entities. I admire Samantha the most, &lsquo;cause she can be the boss in a man&rsquo;s world, but still beautiful and sexual. It has real resonances with Simone de Beauvoir for me. I mean, men are there to be looked at in Sex and..., which is a nice change. For once, women are the centre of attention and can be the fashionable, sexually liberated instigators. And obviously the clothes are amazing too!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Emily laughs loudly at this, her triceps jiggling as she throws her arms in the air in mock elation. At this point we are beginning to worry that Emily is indulging in more recent stereotypes that have evolved from those of old, token gestures from writers and producers to pacify the liberated woman of today. She quickly moves to quell our fears.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;There is no problem in expressing or indulging in your own sexuality and femininity. It&rsquo;s empowering if anything and is good for women as a whole, I think. There&rsquo;s no problem in having an interest in fashion and shoes as long as you maintain your integrity and intelligence as you do so.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It is all about irony at the end of the day. When observing, you have to keep an ironic awareness of your own position. What you do doesn&rsquo;t define who you are. Liking the X Factor doesn&rsquo;t mean that I&rsquo;m just a consumerist drone. It&rsquo;s not all just black and white.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Full of smiles, Emily stares out the window, tonight&rsquo;s television no doubt preying on her mind. What a total cunt.</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>Today, we sat down with Emily Deakin, a Trinity student and television buff, who was eager to speak to us about reality television and the culture that surrounds it.
