{"Body": "Sadhbh Byrne\n\nNostalgia was better in the good old days &ndash; and so, I fear, was my wit. Terrible puns aside, what with the imminent release of U2-inspired movie Killing Bono, the recent reunion tour of The Commitments, and the current Phil Lynott exhibition in Stephen&rsquo;s Green, it appears that many a trip has been taken of late down the well-trodden memory lane of Irish music.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2524\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"247\" caption=\"Phil Lynott, one of Ireland's most famous rock exports\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thin+Lizzy+Phil_Lynott12798.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Thin+Lizzy+Phil_Lynott12798-247x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"Thin+Lizzy+Phil_Lynott12798\" width=\"247\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2524\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nAs we Irish refuse to refrain from constantly reminding ourselves, we are but a tiny soggy isle in the East Atlantic Ocean and yet, we claim to have spawned basically anyone who achieves any modicum of fame (or notoriety, we don&rsquo;t care); we invented the submarine, the Beaufort scale, cheese and onion flavoured crisps, the cure for leprosy, an underwater hairdryer, and even oxygen (spelt with an &lsquo;e&rsquo; though) &ndash; and as the DAA Terminal 2 ad says so pithily we&rsquo;ve reached the world from here. Cue a smouldering glance from that DILF. Phwoar.\n\nOur most illustrious exports, however, are perhaps those of the musical variety, and thus it is most likely no surprise to see this current onslaught of reminiscence. The 1970s and 80s in Ireland provided a musical landscape the likes of which we are only beginning to see re-emerge, after the wilderness years that were Boyzone, B*Witched, and their ilk (although that asterisk was a golden touch, it must be admitted).\n\nAs 2011 marks the 25th anniversary of the death of Phil Lynott, frontman of Thin Lizzy; and March 2011 was recently designated Phil Lynott Month; the afro-topped rocker himself has been celebrated in a Hot Press organised exhibition Still In Love With You: The Philip Lynott Exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition, which opened three weeks ago in the Creative Space on the top floor of Stephen&rsquo;s Green Shopping Centre, includes various Thin Lizzy paraphernalia such as guitars and flight cases, new material from the Hot Press archives, and multi-media and video installations. Lynott&rsquo;s mother Philomena has also released an updated version of her book My Boy: The Philip Lynott Story in conjunction with the exhibition. A special focus of the exhibition is Lynott&rsquo;s songwriting talent, and so the exhibition forms part of the celebration of Dublin&rsquo;s position as UNESCO City of Literature. Though tourists may mistake the bronze statue on Harry Street for Michael Jackson (and, embarrassingly enough, I&rsquo;ve seen some non-tourists make the same mistake), the man had incredible flair which deserves recognition, so the exhibition is well worth a visit. The weekday student price is &euro;8 and &euro;9 at weekends.\n\nAccolades are also being heaped upon lesser-known indie band, U2. The Nick Hamm directed film Killing Bono, shot in Northern Ireland and starring Ben Barnes and Robert Sheehan, is based on Neil McCormick&rsquo;s memoir Killing Bono: I Was Bono&rsquo;s Doppelganger. McCormick, who is currently The Telegraph&rsquo;s chief rock music critic, attended Mount Temple Comprehensive at the same time as the members of U2, however unfortunately never reached the dizzy heights achieved by Paul Hewson et al. Alas, the trailer for the movie also looks less than promising, although the guarantee of some Nathan-from-Misfits screen time is sure to draw a sizeable crowd. The film had its Irish premiere on March 15th and is due for nationwide release on 1st April.\n\nOf course, paying dues to the heavyweights of yore is all very well and good, but what about the future prospects of Irish music? Does The Script provide a solitary vision of what lies ahead?\n[caption id=\"attachment_2525\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Spies, one of Dublin's best new bands\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/l.jpg\"><img src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/l-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"l\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2525\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n\nAuspiciously, there is hope. One band particularly worth keeping an eye on are Dublin alt-rock group SPIES, whose members include guitarist Neil Dexter, an SF Film Studies and German student. With Morrissey in attendance at a recent performance in The Workman&rsquo;s Club (the same set was deemed &ldquo;blistering&rdquo; by Hot Press), a new single due for release on April 23rd, and a gig secured to open the mainstage at the inaugural Forbidden Fruit Festival in the grounds of the Irish Museum of Modern Art on June 4th, it may be best to catch these boys live before their trajectory leaves us all in its wake. The band released a 7&rdquo;, Liars Call Me King, in November last year which is available in The R.A.G.E. (on that most famous of streets, Fade) and also on spies.bandcamp.com for free.\n\n\n\nTo further whet your appetite for homegrown talent, the Trinity Ents Battle of the Bands Final, which takes place this Thursday March 31st in The Button Factory, should naturally be your port of call. Finalists Jet Set Radio, Jefl & Hyde, Tandem Felix and Falling Famous will share the stage with a headlining performance from &lsquo;Europe&rsquo;s Premier 80&rsquo;s Supergroup&rsquo; (kudos to that) Spring Break, fighting to the death for a mainstage slot at Trinity Ball 2011. I&rsquo;m imagining something School Of Rock-esque, and I better not be disappointed. Speaking of Trinity Ball &ndash; that fateful date, 8th April, shall also celebrate the launch of Love:Live Music, the National Music Day, a &ldquo;celebration of all forms of music in Ireland through nationwide free events&rdquo;. The closest event to college will take place in Sol Art Gallery on Dawson Street from 1&ndash;2p.m; Three to Play, a performance of four original compositions for solo flute, electric guitar, piano and keyboard; intriguing, and of course, completely free. A chance like no other to take in some culture before the senseless debauchery of the evening to follow, doin&rsquo; it like dudes and drying your eyes like the crazy kids I know you all are.\n\nSo if you&rsquo;re spending your money in the old town, where the streets have no name, the upcoming weeks will provide ample opportunity to put it to good use in support of our thankfully thriving native music industry. It appears that the hills of our tiny soggy isle in the East Atlantic Ocean were, and will perpetually remain, alive with the sound of music. Huzzah!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Imageurl": "2526", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2523", "Heading": "Irish Music-Dead or Alive?"}
