{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>When MTV first graced our screens back in August of 1981, its ground breaking marriage of popular music, artsy graphics and avant-garde music videos proved to be instantly successful. &nbsp;The idea that music was no longer confined just to the radio or the cassette player paved the way for an increasingly strong link between music and visual art, thus helping to create some of the most daring and memorable music videos of all time (anyone remember Michael Jackson&rsquo;s 14 minute video for &lsquo;Thriller&rsquo;?). &nbsp;MTV&rsquo;s popularity continued to soar throughout the 80&rsquo;s, and during the 90&rsquo;s the channel experienced its cultural heyday, with nearly every teenager on earth tuning in daily for their dose of youth culture.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But when did MTV begin sink into the decline which would ultimately see it becoming a dumping ground for second rate reality TV shows as opposed to a showcase for music and youth culture? &nbsp;Towards the end of the 90s MTV was still labelling itself as a channel devoted to music (albeit with the sporadic intervention of a Beavis and Butthead short), but as the noughties began to creep in, so too did the phenomenon of reality TV. &nbsp;I can enjoy A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila as much as the next person, but there comes a point where you begin to wonder why such TV shows are given air time on a channel which ironically still calls itself &lsquo;Music TV&rsquo;</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the noughties, shows like The Osbournes offered us a bit of mild entertainment, but soon the MTV schedule was packed with increasingly bizarre and convoluted shows, and with this, MTV&rsquo;s transformation from the sublime to the ridiculous was complete. &nbsp;TV shows like Made or The Real World were all good and well when they were interspersed with music videos, but in recent years it seems that such shows have taken over the airwaves of our beloved MTV, thus rendering it virtually unwatchable.</p>\n<p>While MTV does still claim to play a limited selection of music videos, the task of actually airing music related programming has now been charged to MTV&rsquo;s various sibling channels such as MTV Hits and MTV Dance. &nbsp;But while such channels do indeed deliver what they promise by way of a nearly constant stream of music videos, they have failed to live up to the reputation of the original MTV.</p>\n<p>The role of MTV was not only that of a showcase for music, but also the station acted as a cultural phenomenon, inspiring a generation not only with its music, but with its whip-smart VJs, and charmingly misanthropic and sardonic animated characters.</p>\n<p>In many ways, the 90s incarnation of MTV began to define the generation which it portrayed in TV shows like Daria. &nbsp;The so called &lsquo;MTV generation&rsquo; was a new breed of smart (if not overly cynical) teens with definitive views on music. &nbsp;Nowadays however, the only tools MTV can use to inspire or define youth culture are three year old episodes of My Super Sweet Sixteen and reruns of Pimp My Ride, hardly the kind of stuff we will think back to in ten years when we reminisce about our teenage years.</p>\n<p>But what will become of MTV?
