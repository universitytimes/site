{"Body": "Doreen Burke &amp; Negar Sharafi\n\nTuesday was flippin&rsquo; brilliant. In order to celebrate Pancake Tuesday we had the tedious task of traipsing all over town to find the perfect pancake. We started the arduous mission in Crown Alley in the Half Moon Cr\u0119pe Company right in the centre of Temple Bar. The place was as packed as we expected, on that special day that honours the humble art of creating the perfect pancake.\n\nThe choices were overwhelming. Sweet or savoury, chocolaty or fruity, but one thing was assured: they all sounded tantalising. After long moments pondering over the vast possibilities, the decision was made that it was going to have to be sweet. We decided to split two; one fruity and one chocolaty: Apple Ice, which involved stewed apple spiced with a hint of cinnamon wrapped in a light and thin crepe, cooked to perfection and a scoop of creamy vanilla ice-cream on top. The second choice was &ldquo;the Twiks&rdquo; a combination of caramel sauce and nibbed almonds. While both were delicious in their own right, the apple number won the vote of the critics this time round. The price however was not so tasty. At &euro;5.60 for the apple and &euro;5.50 the Twiks it was right up there with the very student unfriendly prices of the famous Trinity pancake destination of choice: Lemon on Dawson St.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2087\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The classic sugar and lemon\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/basicpancakeswithsuga_66226_16x9.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2087\" title=\"basicpancakeswithsuga_66226_16x9\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/basicpancakeswithsuga_66226_16x9-300x171.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"171\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nThe twenty minute wait wasn&rsquo;t particularly impressive either.  However despite it being the busiest day of the year service still came with a smile making the Half Moon pancake experience even sweeter. A dessert can be added for &euro;1.50 to make a &ldquo;Meal Deal&rdquo; out of a Panino, toastie or crepe with a drink combination. Desserts (chocolate cake or a variety of cheesecakes) are usually &euro;3.50 so for a special occasion treat this deal might work out well but otherwise it&rsquo;s still quite expensive for us cash strapped students.\nThe next port of call was Tesco so we could try our hands at the ready made pancake mixes as well as the homemade variety. The battle between &ldquo;thick or thin&rdquo; ensued when we got readymade pancake mixes for each. The Odlums&rsquo; &lsquo;Quick Pancake&rsquo; range had mixes for both and promised quick and easy results. At &euro;3.55 (making 10 medium sized pancakes each) they were certainly cheaper than the restaurant versions but even so, we were determined to find an even cheaper alternative. Once home we donned the aprons and began our quest for the Holy Grail of the Pancake World.\n\nThe Odlums&rsquo; &lsquo;American Style Pancakes&rsquo; were, however, at first a bit of a disappointment. While the packaging promised the perfect pancakes by just adding milk and shaking the bottle we found that this was not quite the case. The flour at first did not mix properly and instead clumped in a starchy mess at the bottom of the container. With the help of a wooden spoon, though, this issue was resolved and the results were satisfying. The &lsquo;American Style&rsquo; pancakes turned out fluffy and delicious, the perfect host for a sweet topping. We decided to steer away from the traditionally American bacon and maple syrup and instead opted for a more sophisticated and fruity accompaniment. A mixture or mascarpone cheese and lemon curd along with frozen summer berries complemented the hearty American favourite perfectly.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2088\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"An altogether more complicated affair\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/savoury_pancakes_closeup_recipe_page.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2088\" title=\"savoury_pancakes_closeup_recipe_page\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/savoury_pancakes_closeup_recipe_page-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nNext we tried the Odlums&rsquo; &lsquo;Cr\u0119pe Style&rsquo; pancake mix which turned out to be a bigger success than its American brother. Easier to mix and flip, these pancakes were definitely more versatile as they would also be perfect for savoury fillings. The options for toppings were never ending. We tried melting marshmallows into dark chocolate which resulted in a sticky gooey mousse-like confection. Spread on a pancake in combination with chunky peanut butter it makes for a heart attack on a dinner-plate but, damn, it tastes good.\n\nFrozen berries and melted white chocolate was a more cosmopolitan take on the classic pancake-and definitely one to impress your other half with. A Dairy Milk Caramello bar with crushed Maltesers is another quick and easy filler and divine with a glass of milk on the side.\n\nWe also made a pancake batter from scratch (recipe below*), which was fast, simple, and, without a doubt, the cheapest option. While the pancake was plain and boring on its own, it provided the perfect home for a variety of both sweet and savoury fillings.\n\nAll of the pancakes reviewed above had both pros and cons but considering the price the homemade version is definitely the best choice for cash savvy students.\n\n<!--more-->\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\"><strong>Basic Pancake Recipe*</strong>\n</span></h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\u02dd - \u017e standard mug of plain flour (depending on desired thickness)\n1 egg\n\u02dd mug mixture of milk and water.\n(Makes 4 )\nMix all the ingredients in a large bowl with a fork or whisk until the mixture is smooth.
