{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>On January 6th the controversial anti-whaling mission, the Sea Shepherd, entered the news once again after its smallest vessel, the Ady Gil, sunk off the coast of Antarctica. The captain of the Sea Shepherd mission, Paul Watson, accused Japanese whaling ship, the Shonan Maru, of deliberately ramming the vessel and causing it to break in two. A charge that the Japanese deny.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society (SSCS) was established in 1977 by Watson, one of the founding members of Greenpeace. The mission is described as an &ldquo;international non-profit, marine wildlife conservation organization.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Watson&rsquo;s tactics have always been dramatic, and he vowed to apply himself to the protection of whales after a confrontation with a Soviet whaling ship in 1975, in which he was nearly killed after chaining himself to the vessel. Watson split from Greenpeace two years later as his frustration grew over the perceived bureaucracy of the organisation. Watson favoured a direct action approach, practical intervention rather than political pressure.</p>\n<p>The SSCS is funded both by governments and private backers that support Watson&rsquo;s renegade, and often violent, approach to the protection of whales. Their mission has also become the focus of a popular Discovery Channel documentary Whale Wars.</p>\n<p>The high suspense documentary follows the ongoing battle between the Sea Shepherd vessels and the Japanese whaling fleet. Watson and his crew employ tactics such as throwing foul smelling butyric acid onto the deck of the Japanese ship and sabotaging eqiuptment such as drift nets.</p>\n<p>Other methods include &lsquo;prop fouling&rsquo;, where a rope is released into the water, entangling itself in the ship&rsquo;s propeller.</p>\n<p>The Japanese respond with giant, high force water canons, that prevent the apprach of smaller vessels such as the Ady Gil. The LRAD is also a favoured weapon, a system that produces a noise so violent that even the Sea Shepherd helicopter is endangered.</p>\n<p>The documentary is presented as a David and Goliath struggle on the high seas, where good men never give up a fight, and bad Japanese people kill whales. The contest is so unevenly matched that it&rsquo;s almost comic, and has even attracted a South Park take off. The lobbing of what are essentially stink bombs at a crew that are well used to the stench of whale flesh just doesn&rsquo;t seem enough.</p>\n<p>The publicity that Whale Wars has stirred up has been invaluable to the SSCS, however, and has attracted support from an array of celebrities.

Van Der Zee asigns Watson to the &ldquo;moral grey area&rdquo; in people&rsquo;s minds that surrounds violence against property. Watson, she claims, admits to ramming boats himself, just as the Shonun Maru did, but defends his actions as a necessary tactic. Accusations against him have placed his mission in the realm of &lsquo;eco-terrorism&rsquo;, protest that permits violence.

There is undoubtedly an element of the ridiculous about Watson and his very personal campaign.
