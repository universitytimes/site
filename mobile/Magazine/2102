{"Body": "Aoife Considine-\n\nWe all know how it is, that sliding scale as you walk from The Arts Block down to the Hamilton; as intelligence seems to increase, so sense of style rapidly declines. Sure, this is how it seems on the surface, but being a true &ldquo;Hamilton Head&rdquo; myself, I set out this week to quash the theory that the ABKs (arts block kids) rule the roost in the fashion stakes.\n\nOkay, I&rsquo;ll admit that from the moment I set foot in the Arts Block I was pushed for people not to take photos of, but there was also a great sense of competition about the place. &ldquo;Every street&rsquo;s a catwalk&rdquo; and I suppose every corridor now is too. Each person there looked as though they&rsquo;d stepped straight out of some fashion magazine; &ldquo;Team England&rdquo; in their Barbour jackets and tweed, Arts students in their hats, heels and fur of many colours and even those notorious BESS guys and dolls seem to have their own preppy style going on. I was slightly uneasy sitting among this crowd with a book on vector calculus in my bag as cloth of many prints and colours flashed past my eyes before I could even flash them with my camera. Here, everyone dresses to impress and anything seems to go.\n\nNot so in the Hamilton. If you&rsquo;ve never ventured down to the elusive Science, Maths and Engineering end of college then you are probably conjuring up images of a dank grey building inhabited by even more greying humans. In fact, The Hamilton building itself is extremely bright, like it&rsquo;s students, and although they wouldn&rsquo;t be the most fashion forward kids on the block, they do have style.\n\nWhile the ABKs flaunt about all competing for the limelight in their concrete jungle, the Hamilton Heads casually roam about their airy haven dressed to impress no one but themselves. Sure, an English student would stick out like a sore thumb down there, but the Hamilton embodies a different kind of style to that of the arts block, a more laid-back cool- nothing forced.\n\nSo who&rsquo;s got more style then, the ABKs in their technicolour dreamcoats or the Hamilton Heads in their clean-cut vision? I took to the campus to take a peek at what each had to offer.\n\n<strong> Arts Block\n</strong>\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_6294.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2105 alignnone\" style=\"border: 3px solid black;\" title=\"Colin street style\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_6294.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"768\" />\n</a></strong><strong>\nName: </strong>Colin McGrane\n\n<strong>Course: </strong>SF Political Science and Geography\n\n<strong>Who influences your style? </strong>\n\nDefinitely my Dad, I&rsquo;m always stealing his clothes.\n\n<strong>What would be your favourite store to shop in?</strong>\n\nBrown Thomas would definitely be my favourite store in Dublin, not specifically for buying, more so just for aesthetics.\n\n<strong>What&rsquo;s your best fashion investment?</strong>\n\nThis jacket.
