{"Body": "Fionn Fitzpatrick, Multimedia Editor\n\nTo\u00a0complement the University Times' brilliant SU coverage reporting\u00a0the swinging pendulum of public opinion towards all our colourfully-clad SU candidates, let's have a look at the best\u00a0election\u00a0moments from both TV and film! Maybe our SU candidates will take some inspiration from the clips!\n\nFirst up is Michael Douglas' response to the Communications-esque\u00a0mud-slinging of the Republican Party in <em>The American President. </em>Note his delivery: thoughtful and considered,\u00a0yet passionate and commanding respect. A response of this caliber to the negative campaigning of\u00a0an opponent would almost certainly secure victory for anyone running in the SU elections, especially if they can get Michael J. Fox to look approving on the sidelines.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mWRVbWMvi7c\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>The American President\n\nNext up, who could forget the seminal 'Vote for Pedro' campaign from <em>Napoleon Dynamite</em>? Simple, but effective, Pedro's campaign has influenced many an SU candidate since it's inception in 2004. Don't believe me? You should have seen\u00a0SU campaigns before Pedro invented the\u00a0campaign t-shirt and\u00a0amateur dancing.\nTruly an underdog story, his victory proves the election is never won until the polling stations close.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4VoHUSB_bhQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>Pedro's Dance Stunt\n\nFans of <em>The Wire</em> will remember\u00a0Tommy Carcetti's run for mayor of Baltimore in Seasons 3 and 4 of the HBO series. Successfully splitting the black vote of the city and employing a proven\u00a0hired-gun as his campaign manager, Carcettis campaign was strategically expert. Our SU candidates will sympathise with Carcettis breakdown half way through the race, as I'm sure many of them are wondering why they signed themselves up for this in the first place.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ju2hRbGkI0Y\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>Tommy Carcetti Has A Fit\n\nFinally check out this kid in HBO's documentary <em>By The People</em> which followed Barack Obama's Presidential campaign. Showing tireless, honourable work ethic and patience beyond his years, he's an inspiration to the hordes of campaign teams generating hype and support for their SU candidates. Obama's success in 2008 proves the worth of\u00a0such canvassing.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EA4n9QcZP10\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nPlease leave your own favourite election moments in the comments, and best of luck to all the candidates!", "Imageurl": "1154", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1040", "Heading": "The Best Election Moments from TV and Film"}
