{"Body": "Would you like to gain some teaching experience? Are you interested in volunteering?\r\n\r\nWrite-up! is recruiting more volunteers to help run their workshops. They are particularly looking to recruit first and second year students. Journalism experience is a plus, but is not required.\r\n\r\nAll that is required is enthusiasm and a genuine interest. The aim is to spark an interest and confidence in writing by supporting and encouraging teenagers to take an interest in Journalism.\r\n\r\nGetting involved is not a massive commitment and you will be able to fit it around your timetable as the times of the workshops vary.\r\n\r\nWriteup! will be holding a training/information session on Wednesday <strong>19th of February at 19.00 in room 3074 A</strong> (Arts Block). If you would like to get involved please email <strong><a href=\"mailto:writeuptcd@gmail.com?Subject=Hello%20again\">writeuptcd@gmail.com</a></strong> to confirm your attendance.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Screen-shot-2014-02-17-at-16.19.30.png", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24347", "Heading": "Write Up!"}
