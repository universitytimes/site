And Co-op directors on day one of Week Six are never easy to get a hold of. Hours of rehearsals and last-minute costume checks stand\u00a0 between me and an elusive interview with anyone remotely involved with this year&rsquo;s show - the curiously-titled <em>Orb of Azazel: A Cattermonkey Uprising</em>. When I do get a chance to talk to Oonagh, one of the directors, it&rsquo;s an hour until the curtain rises on Co-op 2012, the creative lovechild of Jack Gleeson, Neil Fitzpatrick, Heather Walsh, and Oonagh O&rsquo;Donovan.\n\nFirst things first: what is a <em>Co-op</em>? We&rsquo;ve all heard of the supermarket, and the bank, and the bookshop, but it&rsquo;s safe to say this isn&rsquo;t any of those. Oonagh tells me it&rsquo;s &ldquo;the biggest production we do every year and it&rsquo;s not even based on drama.&rdquo; So what <em>is </em>it, then? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the experience we have,&rdquo; she says earnestly. &ldquo;We try to get every different, any kind of person we can, get them involved in our production.&rdquo; So Co-op isn&rsquo;t full of your typical artsy, denim-jacketed, drama student? &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a way of getting people into the society who wouldn&rsquo;t normally be involved in Players.&rdquo; Co-op is a bit of a unique experience, then: it&rsquo;s something that you might as well audition for, even if you&rsquo;re an Engineering student whose last foray into the theatre was your fourth class school trip to The Ark. It&rsquo;s not all about the drama kids, but that&rsquo;s not the only thing that makes it a Players anomaly. It&rsquo;s the only Players production that has its roots in a strong tradition - even if that tradition does involve time travel, misfits, and someone saying that their testicles have retracted. And believe me, I didn&rsquo;t make any of those up. Not even the last one.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13528\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/20/co-op-2012-einstein-explorers-and-enthusiasm/the-wright-brothers-meet-a-d4-and-a-sex-maniac/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13528\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-13528\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-Wright-brothers-meet-a-D4-and-a-sex-maniac3-300x116.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"116\" /></a> The Wright Brothers meet a D4 and a sex maniac[/caption]\n\nOonagh laughs when I ask her about this traditional format. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a group of ragtag misfits who get together to fight evil and save the world and travel through time.&rdquo; Did they have that this year? Of course. &ldquo;And there are these really specific ones that we&rsquo;ve upheld, like God has to be part of it, one of the main characters has to die, and there&rsquo;s a line that&rsquo;s said... &lsquo;How cold are you?&rsquo; &lsquo;So cold that my testicles have retracted.&rsquo;&rdquo; Additionally, within the tradition of even having a Freshers&rsquo; Co-op, comes the method of writing it, something that this year&rsquo;s directors couldn&rsquo;t emulate. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a whole Co-op tradition that directors go away for a week and write it. Then they would have most of it done, they would have this great bonding trip.&rdquo; Sounds like a good time. But what happened? &ldquo;First of all our schedules completely conflicted,&rdquo; but after that it was a decision &ldquo;to write the play around them.&rdquo; That meant taking daily two-hour rehearsals, where improv was the order of the day (&ldquo;Really fun games, really high energy. The first three weeks were an introduction into improvisation, and every week we&rsquo;d push them harder to more difficult improv games...&rdquo;) and then, after-hours, putting a show together. Oonagh admits that &ldquo;the writing process was hard. Sometimes you&rsquo;d be writing eleven hours a day. You were just so exhausted.&rdquo; Characters that the cast made can be seen in the finished product. &ldquo;We really got into building up characters which I found encompasses the whole co-op ethos.&rdquo; This isn&rsquo;t a case of four people coming together to write their own play. This is a project that involves everybody to come up with the creative goods. And if improv isn&rsquo;t your thing, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Co-op can lead you to other theatrical places besides the stage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13522\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/20/co-op-2012-einstein-explorers-and-enthusiasm/the-evil-conquistadors-hear-some-unwanted-information/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13522\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-13522\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-evil-conquistadors-hear-some-unwanted-information3-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a> the evil conquistadors hear some unwanted information[/caption]\n\nTalking to the resident techie, Deirdre van Wolvelaere, proves this point. Initially planning on getting involved in the tech side of things, she ended up auditioning for Co-op 2011 and spending six weeks in the Co-op machine. As Oonagh says, after Co-op people &ldquo;just want to get involved and stick around.&rdquo; Now a self-confessed Players addict (&ldquo;I just love Players&rdquo; she says, before calling the lighting guy, Jonathan, &ldquo;the best person I&rsquo;ve ever met.&rdquo;) Deirdre agrees. After Co-op she started &ldquo;going to get-ins&rdquo; - the Sunday set-up of the shows for the next week - at first just &ldquo;waiting around, being told to do stuff.&rdquo; That &ldquo;waiting around&rdquo; soon turned into a position as Tech Manager, which, she says, came about by being patient. &ldquo;People think to get into tech here you need to know stuff, but you don&rsquo;t at all. You just have to hang around and be interested, and, as much as it sucks, you have to be patient.&rdquo;\n\nSo, now you know how to become Tech Manager - audition for next year&rsquo;s Co-op, stick around, spend your weekends in the theatre and soon you too could be wearing a black committee zippy. But here&rsquo;s a trickier one: how to become a producer of the biggest production in Players? House Manager Donal McKeating - one of this year&rsquo;s five - explains. &ldquo;Producing is a sign that you&rsquo;re involved in Players,&rdquo; he says, and Co-op itself can be &ldquo;a stepping-stone to something else.&rdquo; But don&rsquo;t go thinking that producing is a definite path to directing. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think one leads to the other,&rdquo; he says. Add to that the fact that only one of this year&rsquo;s directors is a former producer, and you&rsquo;ve got a case against the common belief that Players is a clique. Oonagh acknowledges this, saying that &ldquo;a clique does form around [Co-op] for a while, but I think that&rsquo;s just because you&rsquo;re in such an intense experience for six weeks, and that would happen naturally.&rdquo; Deirdre agrees, as far as tech is concerned, anyway. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re there of our own time, not getting paid... we did four days work and we probably had a total of eight or nine hours sleep. An unbelievable amount of work went into it.&rdquo; When you&rsquo;re in an enclosed environment for such a long time - think the first half of Michaelmas term - it&rsquo;s no surprise cast and crew become closer than bark on a tree, to use an expression that I picked up from watching too much SpongeBob SquarePants. However, set-and-poster designer Grace Healy admits that she didn&rsquo;t immediately warm to Co-op when she joined Players as a first year.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/20/co-op-2012-einstein-explorers-and-enthusiasm/more-sing-along-fun/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13529\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13529\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/more-sing-along-fun3-300x160.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" /></a>\n\n&ldquo;I had issues with it,&rdquo; she says, curling up on one of the old rehearsal room chairs. &ldquo;I feel like sometimes it gives out the impression that you have to &lsquo;get in&rsquo; to Players and that Co-op is your &lsquo;in&rsquo;, and if you&rsquo;re not in Co-op you haven&rsquo;t got &lsquo;in&rsquo; with &lsquo;the Players&rsquo;. You hear that phrase being bandied about a lot.&rdquo; However, like Oonagh, she believes that the clique &ldquo;does fade&rdquo; and only thinks that the drama society is cliquey &ldquo;in the way that all societies are.&rdquo; The difference, she says, is that &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not contributing, you can&rsquo;t stick around.&rdquo; Whether you think it&rsquo;s cliquey or not, everyone is playing their part in one way or another - through producing, set designing, poster making or even just going to see the shows. Having not been involved in Co-op before, she now describes herself as a &ldquo;fan&rdquo;, and sees Co-op as an important part of making sure that Players remains a vibrant place that thrives on &ldquo;new faces&rdquo;. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another reason we&rsquo;re not a clique,&rdquo; she says. With Co-op, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not looking for new people to add to the clique. The hope is that the co-oppers stick around and contribute.&rdquo; Grace herself is the whizz kid behind the set - with its ever-changing murals and innovative two-storey design - and the deliciously old-style poster. &ldquo;I love old-y stuff,&rdquo; she says, grinning. &ldquo;I found a really old map of the world from like the 1600s. It&rsquo;s really inaccurate. Hopefully it&rsquo;s eye-catching enough.&rdquo; As for the set: &ldquo;Our main idea was that we were going to have a rotating platform which would have been class. But if the design doesn&rsquo;t match the script you have to cut it...&rdquo; Of course, neither Grace nor her set constructer, treasurer Jack Toner, laid their eyes on the script until it was written, and that wasn&rsquo;t until week three. She says that it was &ldquo;very collaborative. I&rsquo;m really happy with how it is now.&rdquo; And so she should be - it&rsquo;s not every day you see a set that is at once some godforsaken town in the Irish countryside, and Einstein&rsquo;s secret base in Antarctica.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13523\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"227\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/20/co-op-2012-einstein-explorers-and-enthusiasm/img_8924/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13523\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-13523\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_89243-227x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"227\" height=\"300\" /></a> einstein copes with impending doom[/caption]\n\nSpeaking of godforsaken towns and secret bases, what about the actual show itself? It&rsquo;s all very well to sit around discussing light boards and eleven-hour shifts, but if the show&rsquo;s no good then no amount of fancy tech is going to save it. Fear not. It&rsquo;s a bit of a revelation.\u00a0 Thursday night was a predictable sell-out, and the cast attacked their script (and their stage) with gusto. The premise: seven (or something) misfits go on a quest to capture a magical orb before evil bandits get there first. (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the bible,&rdquo; Oonagh tells me. &ldquo;These angels had this all-powerful orb and... if any man were to get their hands on this orb they&rsquo;d only use it for evil.&rdquo;) The misfits are - among others - a memorable Irish lad who only wants to play a bit of GAA (Tomas the hurler who ends up in Morocco for a match while wearing a soccer jersey was one of the brightest stars), a D4 chap with a degree in Gender Equality with a very square pair of glasses, and a chavvy girl who only talks in sex metaphors - and the evil bandits are a bunch of camp conquistadors. Along the way they meet a funny little group of colonials - all drawn-on moustaches and khaki shorts - a girly James Joyce, the Cripple of Inishmaan (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not drunk, I&rsquo;m just severely crippled&rdquo;) and the Wright Brothers (&ldquo;two wrongs don&rsquo;t make a right, they make two Wright brothers.&rdquo;). As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the live, dressed-up band played a series of songs that the actors roared along to, and the whole thing culminated in a showdown at Einstein&rsquo;s secret lair in - you guessed it - Antarctica.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13521\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/20/co-op-2012-einstein-explorers-and-enthusiasm/tea-with-the-explorers-a-vampire-and-a-rhino-head-all-in-a-co-op-days-work/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13521\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-13521\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/tea-with-the-explorers-a-vampire-and-a-rhino-head.-All-in-a-co-op-days-work3-300x141.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"141\" /></a> Tea with the explorers, a vampire, and a rhino head. All in a Co-op day's work![/caption]\n\nIf this year&rsquo;s co-op has taught us anything - besides the fact that anything drink-related is usually a winner - it&rsquo;s that it has no creative limits. With co-op, anything goes. Einstein can be a girl (a very exuberant one). It can accuse itself of having racial stereotypes. You can say &lsquo;F the Brits&rsquo; if that&rsquo;s the main thing on your mind. And you can go anywhere in the world, even if it&rsquo;s just to hear some of the most ear-scratching accents imaginable. Not to mention the fact that you can make hand-puppets relevant to just about anything. The only thing this year&rsquo;s effort was sorely lacking in was a typically sloppy Co-op kiss. (There was one tiny one, but I&rsquo;m not counting that. They made up for it with the sex jokes. And the bit when someone says: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re sure about this, Einstein?&rsquo; to a girl in an Arnotts lab coat.) There was even a pub brawl thrown in there, a bit of IRA action (an IRA letter read out in a D4 accent was one of the most sparkly moments), and a lecture from an economist. It really has something for everyone. As Donal says: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of it. And I think it always is a hilarious show, so to see something like Co-op is something just so different. It is ridiculous, there&rsquo;s hundreds of characters. Anyone who isn&rsquo;t in Players will go and have an amazing time.&rdquo; Deirdre says that &ldquo;seeing it work just makes all of the hours that we were awake and not sleeping worth it.&rdquo; On opening night, Oonagh suddenly sees the week flashing before her eyes. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re planning the get-out already,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s terrifying that we&rsquo;re already planning that far ahead.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s the challenge of Players - great shows go up and down in the course of one week, during which - this time - you could find yourself in Antarctica, a pub fight, in the presence of WB Yeats, or on the SS Suffragette. &ldquo;You really feel part of something,&rdquo; says Donal. &ldquo;It reminds everyone why we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13526\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/20/co-op-2012-einstein-explorers-and-enthusiasm/the-cripple-and-associates-spot-something-in-the-distance/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13526\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-13526\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/the-Cripple-and-associates-spot-something-in-the-distance3-300x223.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"223\" /></a> the Cripple of Inis Maan and associates spot something in the distance...[/caption]", "Imageurl": "13524", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13520", "Heading": "Co-op 2012: Einstein, Explorers and Enthusiasm"}
