However, Rosie Goulding and Nicole O'Sullivan (Team 24) are currently <a href=\"http://trinityvdp.squarespace.com/jailbreak-map/\">the official leaders</a> in terms of confirmed location (Bucharest, Romania).\n\nThe organisers confirmed just after 21:20pm that Team 32 (<span style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">Brian Cusack and Siona Wu Murphy) had arrived in Dubai, the first confirmed arrival outside of Europe.</span>\n\nFinn Murphy and Lulu Courtney posted photos to their personal Facebook pages depicting an attempt to hitch-hike in Salzburg, Austria, while other teams have posted evidence of their arrival in Frankfurt, Geneva, and Ayr.\n\nThe 40 teams of two are forbidden from spending money on transport and have found success in convincing travel companies to offer a free journey by way of sponsorship. The competition was famously popularised by Cambridge University students in January, with the winners making it as far as Australia.\n\nOver &euro;6,700 of sponsorship has been raised so far by the competition, which will go towards St. Vincent de Paul, Amnesty International, and a number of other charitable organisations.\n\nColm O'Gorman, Director of Amnesty International Ireland, is among thousands to have endorsed the event on Twitter. 'TCDJailBreak2013' was 'trending' first in both Dublin and Ireland this afternoon. 'Trending' is a measurement of the proportion of users in a given city or country discussing a particular topic.\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">Really? Someone got to Buenos Aires? Amazing!
