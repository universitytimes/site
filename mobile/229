None more so than Elaine McDaid, the current Secretary of the Ents Crew and Ents Officer for DU Snowsports Club. Managing a 300 strong team of enthusiastic volunteers, the Derry girl and Senior Sophister law student plans to climb the final rung on the Ents ladder.\n\nMcDaid&rsquo;s responsibilities as Ents Secretary see her co-ordinating events and raising funds for the Ents war chest. Twenty-two years old, she&rsquo;s also also been involved with Trinity Singers, acting as PRO during her second and third year of college. This year Elaine has run events and fundraisers in conjunction with Cancer Soc, VdP and many of the sports clubs in college. She has also hosted numerous class parties in the Mezz, where she runs promotion for &ldquo;Messy&rdquo; on Tuesdays.\n\nMcDaid also runs &ldquo;Vogue&rdquo; at Andrews&rsquo; Lane Theatre, a night that has proven very popular with Trinity students. With so many strings to her bow, McDaid can legitimately claim to be well-connected within the entertainment industry, something she intends to fully utilise next year if she&rsquo;s elected.\n\nGenockey&rsquo;s tenure as Ents officer has been widely regarded as successful, with general appreciation for his efforts to cater for a wider variety of tastes than his predecessors and an unmatched work rate which sees him grafting into the wee hours most nights of the week. McDaid seeks to build on this goodwill by giving students more of a say in what they want from their Union, particularly from Ents. Mc Daid says that &ldquo;if students are given the chance to run their own live gigs, fundraisers and events, with the support from and backing of Trinity Ents, then we can open up the range of events on and off-campus and make Trinity Ents more accessible to more students across college. Ents should exist as a resource for all students.&rdquo; Citing the unprecedented success of RAG Week as an example of how independently organised ventures can have great success and enrich college life, McDaid wants to see Ents-supported events organised by eager students who want to offer something different to a college community with diverse tastes.\n\nMcDaid feels that one of the obstacles students face in organising on-campus events is the plethora of college regulations which can deter even the most enthusiastic event organiser. McDaid says that she has &ldquo;four years of experience navigating the often tricky college system and will encourage and support the use of these venues, helping students run their own events in their own space.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: right; font: 13.0px 'Helvetica Neue'} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 10.0px; font: 9.0px 'Whitney HTF'} span.s1 {letter-spacing: -0.1px} -->Elaine McDaid\n\nSS Law\n\n<strong>Ents Officer</strong>\n\nThis year&rsquo;s prospective Ents candidates are, as ever, already firmly dug into the Ents crew.
