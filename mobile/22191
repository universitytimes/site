David Carroll also backed this proposal, and presented a new government solution to tackle homophobic bullying, in a campaign known as &ldquo;Stand Up Don&rsquo;t Stand for Homophobic Bullying&rdquo;, commencing in March 2014.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From a legal aspect, Dr Shannon&rsquo;s also called for the removal of section 37(1) of the Employment Equality Act, an act which permits a certain degree of discrimination in schools with a religious ethos. This Act has been blamed for many occasions of discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender teachers.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/shannonlgbt.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22191", "Heading": "Special Rapporteur on Child Protection Calls for Greater Support for LGBT Young People"}
