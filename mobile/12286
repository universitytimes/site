{"Body": "<strong>Leanna Byrne<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=12287\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-12287\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-12287\" title=\"Grant\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Grant3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"310\" height=\"415\" /></a></strong>\n<em>Deputy Editor</em>\n\nTaoiseach Enda Kenny has said that local authorities will not be entitled to withhold a portion of any grant to cover the &euro;100 household charge, while Minister for Education Ruair\u00ed Quinn has confirmed a rise in third level fees to &euro;2,500 next year this evening.\n\nAt least eight local authorities were considering following the lead of South Tipperary and Clare County Councils in asking third-level grant applicants to submit proof they have paid the household charge.\n\nEarly this evening South Tipperary County Council reversed their decision to withhold grants &ldquo;following the receipt of further advice&rdquo;. The council will now process 450 grants in 2012, of which almost 70 percent have been processed to date.\n\nDespite the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision to come out against limiting access to third-level grants, the Taoiseach defended the county councils&rsquo; saying that they should do everything to increase the rate of payment. In addition, Mr Kenny felt that the local authorities had the right to know who has paid the &euro;100 charge.\n\nIn reaction to steps taken by Clare County Council the Union of Students in Ireland President John Logue welcomes the Taoiseach&rsquo;s decision not to support the county councils, but that it &ldquo;was about time&rdquo;.\n\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an issue about whether or not you&rsquo;ve paid your household charge,&rdquo;Logue told The University Times. &ldquo;This is about students who are in desperate need of financial aid for third-level education. Whether or not their parents have paid the charge should not come into it. You are refusing an adult financial aid as a punishment for another adult&rsquo;s decision.&rdquo;\n\nMr Logue went on to remind the county councils that if they refuse grant access to any students the USI will undergo legal proceedings to ensure students are protected.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Fees increase</strong></p>\nMeanwhile, Mr Quinn told the Oireachtas Education Committee the student contribution fee - which currently stands at &euro;2,250 - will reach &euro;3,000 by 2015. This year&rsquo;s increase is to generate an additional &euro;18 million for the Exchequer. Subsequently the Minister is set to cut &euro;77 million from the budget.\n\nSpeaking about the increase in the contribution fee, Mr Logue said that Ruair\u00ed Quinn was &ldquo;playing a dangerous game&rdquo; and that exponential increases such as these do not work.\n\n&ldquo;People who are not happy with putting their taxes towards third-level education need to remember that graduates pay 70% more tax. It is an investment for the government.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "12287", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12286", "Heading": "Councils forced to withdraw grants threat, fee rise confirmed"}
