Look out for their stand in Front Square and subtly lurk beside it when hungry.\r\n\u02c7 <em>Afternoon</em>: 2.30pm in The Chamber, GMB is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/234287853391464/?ref=2\">The Phil</a>&rsquo;s &lsquo;speed dating&rsquo; event, which is inevitably horribly awkward but also hilarious and a great way to start meeting all of your new best friends. Prizes consist of vibrators and fleshlights.\r\n\u02c7 <em>Evening</em>: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/673620562649933/?ref=2\">Players</a>&rsquo; Improv Night in Players Theatre starts at 4pm, and will see both Trinity students and actual comedians doing (hopefully) hilarious improvisation comedy that you can get merry to.\r\n\u02c7 <em>Night</em>: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/178698298982041/?ref=2\">The Hist</a> are hosting a pub crawl at 7pm, starting with a reception in their Conversation Room. The Hist are great at a good dose of pub banter over cheap pints, so this is a good one both for those looking to get involved with the society and those who need a vehicle for Monday evening drinking.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tuesday</strong>\r\n\u02c7 <em>Free Food</em>: Swinging by the Food and Drink Society stand, which has a prominent red canopy, is always a safe bet to score some free lunch.

Follow this with LawSoc&rsquo;s circus-themed &lsquo;LawFest&rsquo; on the Cricket Pitch from 3-5, which involves games, music, and crucially, more free food.\r\n\u02c7 <em>Evening</em>: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/506287229459308/?ref=3\">Cumman Gaelach</a> are hosting a pub crawl as Gaeilge starting at the Pav at 7pm.

This one starts at Trinity Hall, and legendary Halls local Mother Reilly&rsquo;s is its first stop.\r\n\u02c7 <em>Night</em>: The Juggling Society have some juggling planned for outside the circus-themed Trinity Ents night out in association with LawSoc and Players, which takes place at the Grand Social.\r\n\r\n<strong>Wednesday</strong>\r\n\u02c7 <em>Free Food</em>: Players have free food and breakfast in Players Theatre from 10-1.

An exciting trip for the IKEA enthusiast, which is everyone.
