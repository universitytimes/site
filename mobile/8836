{"Body": "&nbsp;\n\n<em>by Colin McGrane</em>\n\nSo that time of year has come again. Evenings are closing in, the first chills of winter are appearing\nin the air, and a good lashing of rain (while never in short supply) is becoming almost a daily\noccurrence. Couple this with a gaggle of fresh faced freshers (try saying that one after a few drinks),\nand a sprinkling of crunchy windfall foliage and you have all the ingredients for a good heady Irish\nautumn.\n\nThe onset of Autumn is traumatic enough without the inevitable moment when you open your\nwardrobe door on October 1st, only to realise that your entire clothing collection is now comprised\nentirely of cut off shorts, flip flops, plimsolls and floaty numbers, all of which are more suited to a\nstroll down the promenade in Nice as opposed to a fight to the death to get down Grafton Street in a\nforce ten gale.\n\nThe shock of a return to an Autumnal wardrobe is one which is both inevitable, and bittersweet. On\nthe one hand, the fact that it is completely implausible (and probably illegal) to leave the house in\nDecember wearing a tube top, denim hot-pants and a pair of Hawaiianas, gives you a carte blanche\nto go wild and buy loads of new lovely clothes. But on the other hand, the realisation that the\neffervescent colours of your summer garb must be replaced by the same year in year out greys,\nbrowns and navy&rsquo;s is enough to kill off even the most hardy of seasonal shoppers.\n\nNevertheless, this season, a whole host of designers are showing us that Autumn/Winter doesn&rsquo;t\nalways have to mean bundling yourself up in a cocoon of beige knitted hell for six months running.\nFor inspiration, why not gaze over British design house Issa&rsquo;s autumn 2011 collection, which features\ncold-weather staples such as layered cardigans, pea overcoats and wrap dresses decked out in a\nrich palette of deep, burnt oranges and warm smoky blues. Even the always controversial issue of\nbrightly coloured tights has reappeared in the Issa collection, and while the flashy, ebullient look\nof a pair of tangerine pins might be the height of glamour on a London catwalk, they may be less\nappealing while sashaying down a rain soaked Luas carriage at 8:00am of a Monday morning.\n\nShock value tights aside, Autumn/Winter has left us with a sprinkling of hope that one doesn&rsquo;t have\nto sacrifice one&rsquo;s fashion identity just for the utilitarian necessities of defending against hypothermia\nand water logging. Alexander Wang&rsquo;s always creative collection even managed to use layers to allow\nthe seemingly unattainable feat of wearing short sleeves during the darker months. Bare limbs can\nflow free in doors before being bundled away inside grungy pleather bomber jackets and whimsical\nyet edgy cape-come-trench coats.\n\nThis Autumn has also seen the return to use of coloured print fabrics. For inspiration, take a gander\nat Balenciaga&rsquo;s uber modern block printing, which merges deep but vibrant Autumnal colours with\nwhite for a strikingly up to date spin on classic fabric printing. For a more timeless feel, follow the\nlead of Turkish-Canadian fashion designer Erdem, who uses a classic floral printing technique across\na variety of different fabrics, ranging from plus velvet to sleek satin.\n\nWith a range of colour splashed across catwalks (and soon to be splashed across the high street)\nthere is no excuse to waste time pining for the balmy days of Summer.
