Can you guess what &lsquo;they&rsquo; are? That&rsquo;s right, &lsquo;they&rsquo; are denim jeans and thanks to two Edinburgh students they&rsquo;re in for a serious revamp.\n\nFor many, jeans are the boring basic which constitute the white bread of the fashion world. They&rsquo;re the item of clothing you pull on in a hung-over hurry without a second thought. The things you chuck in the washing machine, the tumble dryer, with a flagrant disregard for the hieroglyphic instructions on that funny little label. They are the style staple that once on, save checking that you&rsquo;re not flying low, need no further concern. \u00a0Jeans are then, for many of us, a necessary but basically unexciting element of everyday life. Like eating or drinking or Phillip Schofield.\n\nA common view this may be, but it&rsquo;s not one shared by the two students who have just started their own denim line, Edward Page and Louise Thompson. The duo&rsquo;s brand, Pocket London, aims to buck the idea of jeans as a boring fashion basic and instead sees them as a style differentiator, something that allows you to stand out from the crowd.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13301\" title=\"page1\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/page13-300x222.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"222\" />\n\nThese notions are explicitly embodied in Page and Thompson&rsquo;s jeans through monochrome pockets which contrast the colour of the main trouser. How did they hit on this distinctive concept? &ldquo;We realised that for item of clothing worn so often, jeans lacked variation&rdquo;, Page tells me, &ldquo;our Pocket London jeans aim to build on the beauty of the 'staple jean' by adding our unique and understated trademark&rdquo;.\n\nSince their launch in October the jeans have been well received by both fashion writers and style conscious consumers who have been buying in their droves from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.pocket-london.com\">www.pocket-london.com</a> and I&rsquo;m interested to know how the pair got into fashion. &ldquo;I had an idea I wanted to pursue&rdquo;, Page explains, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always had a passion, but every time I tried I got it wrong and made mistakes. I carry a black book around with me full of random ideas and I sat down with Louise and read out of the book. We spoke about the jeans and thought &lsquo;let&rsquo;s do it together&rsquo;&rdquo;.\n\nBut breaking into the fashion world hasn&rsquo;t all been plain sailing primarily because, as Thompson says, ''Jeans are the hardest pieces of clothing to design because a) they&rsquo;re impossible to make and b) they are impossible to fit everyone&rdquo;. However, the hard work continues way beyond the initial design stage; not least as both designers are final year students at Edinburgh University. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tricky balance to get right&rdquo;, says Page, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m still sending business emails in lectures&rdquo;.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zH_qz6-BWes\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n\nHard work it may be, but in an industry worth an estimated \u01411.7bn even modest success could bring the young entrepreneurs huge fortune. That said, Page and Thompson aren&rsquo;t getting ahead of themselves. &ldquo;We will be adding a line of t-shirts to the range very soon&rdquo;, says Page of their expansion plans, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re not going to dilute the brand to make a quick buck...we want to build a solid reputation based on current trends and our distinctive pocket concept&rdquo;.\n\nHaving seen a pair of the jeans for myself I can&rsquo;t help but feel that Page and Thompson are on to a winner and, especially given that Christmas is fast approaching, I have no doubt that before long Pocket London will translate into bulging pockets for Page and Thompson.", "Imageurl": "13300", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13299", "Heading": "Pocket London: Students Making It In Fashion"}
