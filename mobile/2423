{"Body": "Jack Leahy\n\nFollowing a law lecture intrusion in December, further Arts block security issues have been raised by a bizarre tutorial intrusion by an unidentified man posing as a replacement tutorial assistant (T.A.).\n\nThe man, described by a student in the Junior Freshman oral French tutorial as &lsquo;tall, with grey hair and a beard, a long coat and a pint of water&rsquo;, entered the classroom on the fourth floor of the Arts building, inquired as to the subject being taught and declared himself to have been sent by the French department to cover for absent regular T.A. Samantha Weyer-Brown, though he did not indicate any knowledge of her identity.\n\nSpeaking to The University Times, a number of students in the class described how the man began to conduct the class in a mixture of broken French and German, with suspicions aroused when the man wrote a basic sentence on the board but omitted the verb.\n\nOne of the students, who does not wish to be named, told The University Times that the man excused &ndash; through his broken combination of languages - his poor standard of French by admitting to having not spoken the language &lsquo;for a long time&rsquo;.\n\nWhen another student inquired as to why the man insisted on teaching the class German rather than French, it was the response which confirmed the students&rsquo; suspicions that he was not in fact sent by the department. A female student of the class described the atmosphere as &lsquo;shocked&rsquo; and one of &lsquo;silence and utter confusion&rsquo; when the man insisted that it would be useful to learn German in case the Germans were to invade Ireland, with the Irish destined to become &lsquo;the new Jews&rsquo;.\n\n&lsquo;At this moment the whole group agreed, by the exchange of sideways glances of shock and disbelief, that there was something not quite right, and clearly this man was not in fact a tutor sent to help with our tutorial&rsquo; said the Junior Freshman student of TSM (Two-Subject Moderatorship) French.\n\nAt this stage, more than five minutes into the tutorial, Ms. Weyer-Brown arrived and dismissed the man, who cited a mix-up in the department as the cause of the even more confused situation brought about by her arrival. As he hurriedly left the class, the man is said to have muttered &lsquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, think about it, Irish as the new Jews, it could happen. Especially with what you do babies before they&rsquo;ve even left the hospital. [You are] bleeding them dry. And I&rsquo;d know, I&rsquo;ve seen it all&rsquo;. It is not known if this event is linked to a reported sighting of a man drinking Bulmers Cider on the same floor by the same group of students on the previous week.\n\nIn a statement released exclusively to The University Times, however, College Communications Officer Caoimhe N\u00ed Lochlainn claimed that the man in question was in fact a student who later admitted to carrying out the tutorial invasion as a joke. &lsquo;A TCD student has admitted to perpetrating the deed and pretending to be a tutor&rsquo;, said the statement received by this paper last Monday afternoon. However, the Communications office backtracked from their claims to have discovered the identity of the perpetrator and the next day claimed that &lsquo;the matter was investigated and  a TCD student will be apologising for his involvement&rsquo;.\n\nOutside the same tutorial on the following Monday, this reporter witnessed College security staff patrolling the fourth floor of the Arts block, casting doubt over the official assertion that the man in question was most likely a harmless student engaging in some sort of prank.\n\nCal Gray, a Junior Freshman French and Italian student who was in the commandeered tutorial, told The University Times that the man was still present in the building after the session in question: &lsquo;I ran into him later and he explained he was attached to the Russian department, although that is most likely [not true]&rsquo;.\n\n&ldquo;It was such a surreal experience, I didn&rsquo;t know whether to burst out laughing or crying!&rdquo; added Kayla Walsh, a French & English Literature TSM student who was also in the tutorial at the time.\n\nOn the Friday following the incident, The University Times made contact with acting head of security Michael Noonan, asking whether or not the department of security were made aware of the incident, and if so what action was taken. The response came through Caoimhe N\u00ed Lochlainn, Press Officer in the College Communications Office, who telephoned this reporter on Friday afternoon to inquire as to what exactly was alleged to have occurred.\n\nDuring said conversation, Ms. N\u00ed Lochlainn inquired as to the class, tutorial assistant, and year group involved in the incident and her end of the conversation indicated no awareness of the event, suggesting that security did not and perhaps could not provide College authorities with sufficient details. A verified account sent to The University Times by a member of the class was forwarded to the Communications office at their request and they issued us with the following statement:\n\n&ldquo;The College&rsquo;s staff, support services and security  ensure that correct protocols are followed to ensure a safe environment for both students and staff. The College can confirm that  an  incident did take place involving a French oral class in which  an individual tried to conduct a class until the tutor arrived.  The matter was investigated and  a TCD student will be apologising for his involvement. If and when such incidents occur, staff and students  should inform  their department and/or school office. Should assistance be required, the Building Attendants should be contacted.&rdquo;\nThis would appear to confirm suggestions that Ms. Weyer-Brown did not inform security of the intrusion. It is also worth noting that the number of working hours which elapsed between the department first making contact with this reporter and the receipt of the statement claiming an &lsquo;intensive investigation&rsquo; had been conducted was less than twelve.\nLate on Friday afternoon, The University Times contacted the head of the French department Professor Johnnie Gratton in person with a view to confirming that the man was not sent by the department. Professor Gratton rejected our efforts to clarify the matter before civil conversation could begin, but Ms. Weyer-Brown and a French department Executive Officer both indicated their understanding that the department were to carry out their own inquiry independent of that conducted by Security and the Senior Tutor.", "Imageurl": "Jack Leahy\n\nFollowing a law lecture intrusion in December, further Arts block security issues have been raised by a bizarre tutorial intrusion by an unidentified man posing as a replacement tutorial assistant (T.A.).\n\nThe man, described by a student in the Junior Freshman oral French tutorial as &lsquo;tall, with grey hair and a beard, a long coat and a pint of water&rsquo;, entered the classroom on the fourth floor of the Arts building, inquired as to the subject being taught and declared himself to have been sent by the French department to cover for absent regular T.A.
