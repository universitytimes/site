{"Body": "<p><strong>The Big Lebowski</strong><br />The Big Lebowski (1998)because it&rsquo;s a Coen Brothers film with Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and Juliane Moore in it, with lots of quotable lines and scenes to get lost in.&nbsp; It is a quirky film that is suitable for any time of the day but is ideal upon arrival home post-club with chipper chips clutched in one hand and a slightly swaying demeanour.&nbsp; Put down the chips (on the table not the sofa) stick on the DVD, find a hoody, curl up with your chips and your drunken mates and enjoy.&nbsp; Please note that the film may be started several times and reach various points in the plot before you have to stop and start again.&nbsp; Worry not, this adds to the overall enjoyment of the film.&nbsp; If you are still confused upon fourth attempt, watch it in the morning clutching a large mug of tea, and it will all become much clearer, dude. <br /><br /><strong>Casablanca</strong><br />Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1943).&nbsp; Why? Because everyone has seen this film&hellip;for a reason.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, it&rsquo;s wartime and love story&hellip;and if you don&rsquo;t watch it, you will be looked at quizzically by those around you (who have seen it numerous times at Christmas and what not), like you&rsquo;re a strange breed of failed film student.&nbsp; And who wants to be that?&nbsp; It is a film that requires some concentration, but is a safe bet for early Sunday evening or a Wednesday afternoon in the library when you should be studying statistics.</p>\n<p><strong>Requiem for a Dream</strong><br />Requiem for a Dream (Darren Aronofsky, 2000), because it is a great film.&nbsp; This comes with a health warning.&nbsp; Never watch alone; preferably watch with a group of good friends.&nbsp; Never watch when depressed or stressed.&nbsp; Always have something upbeat and fun to do when it&rsquo;s over, and give yourself 20 minutes absorption time before partaking in other activities.&nbsp; Warning: may cause mild PTSD.&nbsp; It is one of those films that you will watch and re-shelve, and may not touch again for years, but never regret the time you gave to watching it. <br /><br /><strong>It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life</strong><br />It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life (Frank Capra, 1946).&nbsp; Because sometimes you need a little Capra in your life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen this numerous times, as many people have.&nbsp; The best was on a cold winter evening in Meeting House Square in Temple Bar on fold up chairs, wrapped up in hat, scarf and gloves and clutching a hot chocolate with marshmallows, you can&rsquo;t get more wonderful than that.&nbsp; If fold up chairs aren&rsquo;t to hand, then at least make hot chocolate and grab a cosy blanket to set the mood.&nbsp; Traditionally a Christmas film, this can be enjoyed anytime you need a lift.&nbsp; A good hangover film. <br /><br /><strong>La Haine</strong><br />La Haine (Mathieu Kassovitz, 1995).&nbsp; Because of the amazing French hip-hop music. It&rsquo;s set in the suburbs of Paris and follows a day in the life of three friends who wonder aimlessly through Paris the day after rioting.&nbsp; The black and white style and the music are great, and who doesn&rsquo;t love a bad DeNiro impressions in French, speaking of which&hellip; <br /><br /><strong>Goodfellas</strong><br />Goodfellas (Martin Scorsese, 1990).&nbsp; One of the best films that you will ever see.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a simple as that.&nbsp; If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, stop what you are doing (clearly when you reach the end of this article) and go beg, borrow, or steal it.&nbsp; Well, maybe not steal it, but begging would not be out of the question.&nbsp; If you have seen it, watch it again and quote every quotable line.&nbsp; Bear in mind, that you do have to devote some time to this one, so don&rsquo;t have anything planned for a while, and a good supply of crisps and/or popcorn is advised. <br /><br />Finally, don&rsquo;t forget the guilty pleasure films.&nbsp; Sense and Sensability(Ang Lee, 1995) mostly for Alan Rickman, Love Actually(Richard Curtis, 2003) to adjust Alan Rickman&rsquo;s status to normal and to see Emma Thompson cry again, but mostly to see the best airport chase scene, and Baz Luhrman&rsquo;s William Shakespeare&rsquo;s Romeo and Juliet (1996) because it&rsquo;s wonderful in it&rsquo;s over-the-top-ness.&nbsp; Watch in the privacy of your own home, draped in a duvet or equivalent consuming a variety of chocolate.
