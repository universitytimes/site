In the past few weeks, I've seen what Ents could have been under my tenure. The future looked bright; with me holding the reigns of progress, being pulled by the reign of accountability, in the chariot of cans. I was also beginning to transform Welfare from an organisation of profiteering badly run club nights into an institution that looks out for the well-being of the students.\u00a0</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Over the past week I've experienced dizzying highs and even more dizzying hangovers (am I right Dublin?) I've had a kick about in Front Square, single-handedly shut the Library forever only to see it open the next day, and sold all fifteen tickets to the Trinity Ball. However, over the last few days I've seen everything go to shit; my campaign team have all abandoned me, I'm riddled with debt, and my own son, my little Harcourt, doesn't even recognise me anymore.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">I feel like I've given you everything Trinity; my mind, my spirit and my body, like a prostitute who is not working for profit but is working from the good of her heart (like Nelson Mandela or Schinlder's List).</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Today, as one link between God and the Earth is broken, so too is another. I've decided to step down from the SU Elections. However, I may be gone, but I shall remain, a silent guardian, a watchful protector. I am the Ents Officer this College needs, but not the one it deserves right now. The night is darkest before the dawn, but what a dawn it will be. We shall enter into a new era, where the tunes will play themselves and the cans will drink people. Before I go, please fulfill my one dying wish - the party cannot stop. Goodnight Trinity, and Good Sesh.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Cameron\"</span>\n<div></div>", "Imageurl": "14933", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14932", "Heading": "\"I am the Ents officer this college needs, but not the one it deserves right now\""}
