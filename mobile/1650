{"Body": "Student leaders were outraged last week by an article in the Piranha Election Special on the subject of former SU Presidential candidate Sebastien Lecocq.\nThe Piranha Election Special, edited by John Engle, was published on 14 February and featured profiles on all SU candidates. While most profiles were judged to be within the bounds of satire, the article on Seb Lecocq shocked many who read it and many deemed it to have gone beyond the bounds of satire and into character assassination. The publication also misspelled his first and second name.\n\nClassifying Lecocq as a &ldquo;joke candidate&rdquo;, The Piranha stated that Lecocq was &ldquo;fucking weird&rdquo;. While claiming that it did not want to mock LeCocq for having a medical condition, The Piranha nonetheless named the condition. In an interview with The University Times, Lecocq said that that part of the article was the most offensive to him, and that his medical condition is not open to public discussion.\n\nThe article went on to say that that Lecocq &ldquo;has generated a completely warranted societal ostracism for his incredibly abrasive personality and general douche-baggery.&rdquo; Lecocq&rsquo;s friends also came in for harsh character criticism. The article falsely stated that Lecocq&rsquo;s campaign manager was Dan Reilly, whom it called a &ldquo;noted douchebag&rdquo;. In commenting on this fallacy, The Piranha stated that Lecocq is &ldquo;clearly an absolute asshole who surrounds himself with assholes. A giant black asshole orbited by smaller assholes, one might say.&rdquo;\n\nIn concluding its synopsis on Lecocq, The Piranha said that he was a &ldquo;douchebag from the moment of conception&rdquo; and that he is &ldquo;what is wrong with Trinity&rdquo;.\n\nLecocq said that he was &ldquo;shocked by the piece&rdquo; and that it could only be described as &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;. &ldquo;I want a public apology,&rdquo; said Lecocq. &ldquo;I would expect the editor of The Piranha to issue an apology in the next issue.&rdquo;\nCurrent SU President, Nikolai Trigoub-Rotnem said the article was &ldquo;an unjustifiable personal attack - if someone said it to his face it would be considered bullying, and I view it as such.&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;The article was a cowardly assault on a member of the Students&rsquo; Union who had the guts to put himself in front of the entire college population to try and improve students&rsquo; lives. Although I usually find The Piranha very entertaining, this article was a grave error of judgement on the part of the editor, and he should apologise to Seb publicly.&rdquo;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1766\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Sebastian Lecoq, whom the scathing piece was aimed at\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/182608_154003534654523_100001346330384_298575_4706351_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1766\" title=\"182608_154003534654523_100001346330384_298575_4706351_n\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/182608_154003534654523_100001346330384_298575_4706351_n-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nThe reaction to those involved in the elections has been overwhelmingly negative. In his concession speech on Monday 14 February, joke SU President candidate Aaron Heffernan remarked that Lecocq was &ldquo;atrociously slandered in some grubby publication which [he refused] to name&rdquo;. Heffernan&rsquo;s campaign manager, Matt Smyth, said &ldquo;the explanation that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s satire&rdquo; only works when the piece is in any way funny. Does Seb owe Engle money or something? Maybe there was a case of girlfriend stealing? One of those might explain it.&rdquo;\n\nLecocq&rsquo;s former Presidential rival and now SU President-elect, Ryan Bartlett, said &ldquo;the point of The Piranha is to be satirical. That piece wasn&rsquo;t funny, it was a personal attack. The Piranha is not living up to what it&rsquo;s supposed to be doing. It can&rsquo;t continue to do what it&rsquo;s doing now. As editor, I think John Engle owes Seb a printed apology.&rdquo;\n\nEngle also holds the position of Vice-President of the University Philosophical Society, and was for a long time tipped to run for the role of President. Since the publication of the most recent issue, Engle has told close friends that he will not be contesting the election. Phil President Declan Meehan said, &ldquo;I think the Election Special was a step too far. It was in bad taste, especially the piece on Seb Lecocq.\n\nLecocq has confirmed that he has dropped a copy of the article in to the Junior Dean&rsquo;s office, and expects a personal meeting to be arranged when the Dean has considered the contents of the article.\n\nSU Welfare Officer Steph Fleming has received a number of emails about the article, some requesting that she contact the Junior Dean about the article, and others asking about the protocol for making a complaint themselves.\n\nSuch is the severity of the negative reaction towards the article that the normally protective Publications Committee has said that it is taking the matter &ldquo;incredibly seriously and [does] not condone the article in any way.&rdquo; Chairperson of Publications, Grace Walsh, said that the matter was being looked into, with a meeting scheduled this week, and that action would definitely be taken. Walsh did not speculate as to what action would be taken.\n\nThe man on whom most of this criticism falls is The Piranha editor, John Engle. When asked what he thought of the college community&rsquo;s reaction to the piece, Engle simply said that the reaction was &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; and that he could see why people did not agree with what was said but disagreed with the claim that The Piranha had gone beyond the bounds of satire. Adopting a defensive and stubborn nature, Engle said that he would not be issuing a public apology and that if Lecocq wanted to approach him to discuss the matter in person, he was free to do so. When The University Times reminded Engle that he and Lecocq had been in the same Philosophy lecture only last Friday and that Lecocq had fully expected a personal apology before or after that lecture, Engle did not respond.\n\nBefore the Election Special, Engle&rsquo;s editorship had already caused ructions within his own staff with Deputy Editor, Howard Helen, resigning due to differences of opinion. &ldquo;I feel Piranha is a great platform to deliver high-quality satire of a fictional nature to the college community, incorporating submissions from all students,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I believe the continuing trend of SU-bashing, particularly the targeting of individual officers, along with attacks on large societies hugely undermines the hard work that those involved in these ventures do, and it is a trend that I anticipate continuing. The Piranha that we see on our shelves is not my vision, and I did not see fit to continue to attach my name to it. Consequently, I took the decision to resign.&rdquo;\n\nRonan Costello", "Imageurl": "Student leaders were outraged last week by an article in the Piranha Election Special on the subject of former SU Presidential candidate Sebastien Lecocq.\nThe Piranha Election Special, edited by John Engle, was published on 14 February and featured profiles on all SU candidates.
