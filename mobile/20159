{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Last week, Trinity students voted to support the retention and reform of the Seanad in a Students&rsquo; Union referendum, with the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; side receiving 1,342 votes out of 1,991. Following the rejection of the government&rsquo;s proposed abolition in Friday&rsquo;s polls, Trinity College Students&rsquo; Union (TCDSU) is now obligated to campaign for reform of the upper house.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to JS student Fiachra O'Raghallaigh, who called for the referendum, there are a number of routes TCDSU can follow in order to realise reform. Speaking to <em>The University Times</em>, O'Raghallaigh advocated &ldquo;moral support&rdquo; from the SU for Seanad reform, stating that the Union &ldquo;can directly support [the] USI&rsquo;s [Union of Students in Ireland] efforts in lobbying the government for broader political reform&rdquo;. He also stated that students can get involved individually by lobbying their TDs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tom Lenihan, President of TCDSU, expressed his personal satisfaction with the referendum result. According to Lenihan, students are interested in overall systemic political improvement, with the support for Seanad reform a decisive sign in this direction.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TCDSU has begun to engage with the USI concerning the proposed campaign, and Lenihan has advocated a &ldquo;public forum for students&rdquo; to discuss which avenues reform should take. He proposed that a working group on Seanad reform should be created at the next meeting of the National Council, petitioning interested students to be sure to &ldquo;make your voice heard&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proposed changes to the Seanad have been aired in the Quinn-Zappone Bill, a piece of legislation that is currently being put before the upper house and would not require a constitutional amendment to pass, meaning it could be in place by Christmas.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These reforms include democratising the Seanad, which would allow Irish citizens the power to elect Senators of their choosing. A reformed Seanad would also have an equal male-female Senator ratio, as well as increased powers of scrutiny, allowing them more power over European legislation and the holding of inquiries into public affairs.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tom.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20159", "Heading": "Trinity College Students&rsquo; Union to Push for Seanad Reform"}
