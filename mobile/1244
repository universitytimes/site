{"Body": "Michelle Judge-\n\nI was asked to review Castro whilst simultaneously ordering a three in one from Charlie&rsquo;s at half three in the morning, and perhaps I agreed too readily as for all the right reasons my memory of the night is, at best, vague.\n\nMy review is going to be similarly vague because, let&rsquo;s be honest here, what do I really know about Indie music anyway? However, their Facebook page (check your requests, they&rsquo;ve already added you) boasts of &lsquo;the best in INDIE &amp; dance with a choice selection of chart, rock and everything in between from our resident DJ. STEVIE.&rsquo; Like why would they lie? I do recall Stevie playing some Justice-D.A.N.C.E, which unfortunately is a song that I now have to associate as being a pleasant throwback to my youth (I&rsquo;m 21, I&rsquo;m basically over the hill), or at the very least Oxegen Dance Tent circa 2008.\n\nThere was also some Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs, Artic Monkeys, Stevie Wonder&hellip;Bloc Party&hellip;.maybe? In anticipation of the sheer embarrassment that inevitably ensues from the revelation that you&rsquo;re just a wannabe hipster, I am choosing not to elaborate any further on the playlist. Suffice to say, if Stevie has it, he&rsquo;ll play it for you.\n\nAs for the drinks promotions, apparently they&rsquo;re good, &euro;10 for a pitcher of beer? \u00a0I wouldn&rsquo;t know to be honest; pitchers aren&rsquo;t exactly my thing, and I know if I made such an investment I&rsquo;d end up pouring it on myself in some suggestive re-enactment of a scene from Coyote Ugly. Having said that, that did not prevent me from whipping out the ol&rsquo; Laser card and throwing money all over the place. Captain Morgan's and Coke for a fiver? Hello! Several of these later and I was on the pole, giving it absolute socks to a song I pretended to know the words to.\n\nOMG, I never even mentioned the pole, it&rsquo;s actually the best thing about the place, and there are several of them, and the bouncer only took me down like twice.
