{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Members of Trinity College&rsquo;s sports clubs voiced their concern over lack of student representation on committees and other decision-making processes in the Sports Department&rsquo;s annual AGM last Thursday.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Trinity&rsquo;s athletes questioned the decision making process on important issues such as the allocation of funds that the Sports Department currently has in place. Although the Acting Head of the Sports Department, Michelle Tanner, argued that students have a central role in committees this was not acceptable to the members.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Eoin Blaney, member of the DU Sailing Club, claimed that the Sports Department &ldquo;only report on what has been done&rdquo; and that there should be a formal representation system in place for Club Representatives. Another point that Brady made about the final decision not being consulted with the students was met with a simple retort from Tanner, saying &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the hired professionals. Do students go to the health centre and tell the doctor how to treat his patients?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Students&rsquo; Union President Nikolai Trigoub-Rotnem also inquired about the level of involvement that students have on these committees, saying that &ldquo;no concrete decisions&rdquo; are ever made when students are present or that &ldquo;decisions have already been made for them&rdquo;. Nikolai continued to remind the members of the committee that students&rsquo; &euro;77 paid annually to the Sports Department to fund sports facilities should be represented officially.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Students&rsquo; Union President has a seat on the Sport Department&rsquo;s Treasury Committee at present. This is to attempt to ensure that students&rsquo; levy which accounts for roughly 60% the Sports Department&rsquo;s funding is allocated appropriately. It is estimated that the Department has a budget of over &euro;2.3 million a year. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">&ldquo;We have an ad hoc say,&rdquo; Trigoub-Rotnem told The University Times. &ldquo;There should be a formal committee structure with the ability to provide guidance and to reach a decision where everyone&rsquo;s happy. The attitude that the Sports Department are taking is: we want your money, not your input. However, it&rsquo;s clear that not all the students and sports clubs are happy with this.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Another group to voice their opinion was the Ladies Hockey Club who examined the subject of sports scholarships and how awareness of them could be increased. Sports Department committee members ensured the hockey team that their &ldquo;intention this year is to draft a plan&rdquo; that would &ldquo;improve profile and standard&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">There were further concerns in the AGM in relation to the cap standing on the number of clubs that exist in DUCAC. Members were once again displeased with the cap, stating that there was &ldquo;no formal access for new clubs&rdquo;. However, chairman of the executive committee Chairman Prof Cyril Smyth claimed that DUCAC &ldquo;cannot fund any kind of club&rdquo; and there &ldquo;are not enough funds to spread around&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Additional matters that arose in the AGM were the election of the Officers on the DUCAC committe. There was not much movement in regards to the positions on the committee, and athletes seemed to be discouraged with the uncontested re-election of the Chairman to the Committee, Cyril Smyth, as the announcement produced a delayed applause and raised hands in protest.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Luke Acheson was elected Secretary of the Committee, Susannah Cass as the Vice Chairman and James Sweeny as the new Treasurer. The Club Representatives this year are Cormac Doherty, Mark Harris, Eoin Kerrigan, Aoife O&rsquo;Reilly, Sinead Rodger and Elizabeth Shannon. Six other Pavilion Club members were elected through the Executive Committee.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">James Sweeney of the GAA club was glad to be elected Treasurer, remarking in the club&rsquo;s weekly newsletter &ldquo;Thanks to the lads who got me elected - the more people we have on the financial commitee the more sway we making sure money is handed out fairly.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In spite of the students&rsquo; protests, DUCAC had good news for students that avail of the Pavilion Bar. Small events are being organised in conjunction with Entertainments Officer Darragh Genockey. Plans for karaoke and a silent disco in the near future were some of the ideas mentioned.</span></p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Members of Trinity College&rsquo;s sports clubs voiced their concern over lack of student representation on committees and other decision-making processes in the Sports Department&rsquo;s annual AGM last Thursday.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Trinity&rsquo;s athletes questioned the decision making process on important issues such as the allocation of funds that the Sports Department currently has in place.
