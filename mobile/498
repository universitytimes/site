{"Body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Google&rsquo;s Nexus One, heralded as a contender to Apple&rsquo;s all-mighty iPhone, was unleashed at an invitation only event earlier in the month at Google&rsquo;s Mountain View Headquarters in California.</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that this new smartphone is a force to be reckoned with. Manufactured by Taiwanese based HTC, the phone is available exclusively from Google via their website (google.com/phone) meaning that unlike other smartphones including the iPhone, you have the immediate option to buy it &ldquo;unlocked&rdquo; although at a considerable price ($529 unlocked or $179 with two-year contract to T-Mobile). The ability to make phone calls is a mere aside as unsurprisingly the device is a stated &ldquo;multi-purpose computing device&rdquo; and is thus laden with all the bells and whistles you&rsquo;d expect and a little more.</p>\n<p>Aesthetically it&rsquo;s a beauty to behold. Without getting into pounds and inches, the Nexus is both lighter and slimmer than the iPhone and comes with a slightly larger touch screen. The device is also more powerful and comes with more RAM but has only 4GB storage (although this is expandable to 32GB with a removable SD card &ndash; a feature the iPhone lacks). A negative is that apps can only be stored on the phones internal memory which at 512Mb means space will be severely limited. Google have already insisted however that this &lsquo;feature&rsquo; will be dropped in the near future.</p>\n<p>As for battery life, the specs say a single charge will give you 250hrs standby, 7hrs talk and video playback or 20 hrs audio playback. Not bad considering the battery is keeping a 1 GHz beast of a processor ticking over.</p>\n<p>Looking at features, the inclusion of Google&rsquo;s Voice recognition technology certainly stands out and if it&rsquo;s as good as they say it is, typing text messages and facebook updates are a thing of the past as every text field can be controlled via voice commands. First touch, now voice &ndash; we&rsquo;ve come a long way in past 12 months.The Nexus also comes with a 5 megapixel camera complete with built-in LCD flash easily beating iPhone&rsquo;s flash-devoid 3 megapixel version.</p>\n<p>The Android 2.1 operating system (OS) still doesn&rsquo;t have the goods on the iPhone&rsquo;s OS with many users reporting the user-interface to be &ldquo;rough around the edges&rdquo; and lacking the polish of its competitors. It does come with access to a well stocked (18,000+) app store. This pales in comparison to Apple&rsquo;s stock of over 100,000 but is set to flourish with the wider availability of Android running smartphones on the market.</p>\n<p>Vodafone have already secured the initial rights to sell the Nexus in the UK this spring. However unlike the iPhone, Google doesn&rsquo;t want to be tied to one operator preferring to get the phone &ldquo;into as many hands as possible&rdquo; meaning that we can expect to see tie-ins with multiple mobile operators.
