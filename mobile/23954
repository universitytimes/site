{"Body": "<div>\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Kayle Crosson\u00a0</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">| Staff Writer</span>\r\n\r\nIn an open letter addressed to Provost Prendergast, World Religions and Theology and English Literature student Emily Murtagh has called upon the Provost to prevent the Students' Union from holding a referendum on Trinity students' stance on the issue of abortion legislation, taking place this week.\r\n\r\nAlthough Ms Murtagh takes a pro-life stance on the question being posed, &ldquo;should the Students' Union adopt the long term policy to advocate for legislation for abortion to be upon the request of the woman?&rdquo;, she argues that the issue at hand is not solely the obvious debate between pro-life and pro-choice viewpoints. Instead, she focuses primarily on the implications the referendum has on the role of the Students' Union.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nMs Murtagh&rsquo;s main argument is that this referendum is contradictory of Trinity&rsquo;s long-standing policy of independence of thought and inquiry, as outlined in the university&rsquo;s ethics and equality policies; if the Union chooses to support abortion legislation, she claims that this will reduce the value of individual student opinions within Trinity.\r\n\r\nEmily also raises the issue of minorities, especially from diverse backgrounds, who take a pro-life stance on the abortion question and who could potentially feel alienated from their university if the SU referendum results in a pro-choice victory. She finishes the letter with question put to the readers: is a referendum that could potentially result in isolation and division among the student body in accordance with what the Students' Union stands for? This is followed by a personal appeal to the Provost, stating \"I hope that you will not let me down now, and all those who stand to feel alienated from our Students&rsquo; Union if this referendum is passed.\"\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/refletter.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-23959\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" alt=\"refletter\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/refletter.png\" width=\"493\" height=\"335\" /></a></p>\r\nThe Provost does not possess the right to intervene in any referendum carried out by the Union; TCDSU Education Officer Jack Leahy told <em>The University Times\u00a0</em>that the Provost has \"no authority over this kind of activity\". However, speaking to UT\u00a0about\u00a0her controversial letter to the Provost, Ms Murtagh stated that she wants her words to be of symbolic importance, rather than necessarily resulting in direct involvement from the Provost himself:\r\n\r\n&ldquo;I saw writing a letter to the Provost as something primarily with symbolic potential rather than calling for him to directly intervene, though I am interested to hear his response.\r\n\r\n\"I thought making people think about what Trinity is, as an institution, and as a community, might allow them to see the question from a different perspective. I felt a letter would be a good medium for me to unapologetically express my own opinions on the issue.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe entire letter can be read <a title=\"here\" href=\"http://emilymurtagh.wordpress.com/2014/02/06/an-open-letter-to-professor-prendergast-on-the-issue-of-next-weeks-referendum/\" target=\"_blank\">here.</a>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/465984_521847471207106_1990168902_o.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23954", "Heading": "Trinity Student Appeals to Provost on SU Abortion Referendum"}
