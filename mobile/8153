{"Body": "<strong>Emma Tobin</strong>\n<em>Welfare Correspondent</em>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">After a night of canvassing halls, the Welfare candidates found themselves under pressure today, with the prospect of not only the Dining Hall hustings, but also\u00a0as the main event in the Q-Soc's own hustings.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">All three candidates spoke of the positive reception they received in Halls and enthusiasm of Trinity's Freshers. Each candidate found themselves being invited into apartments for tea and chats. Haughey in particular was popular, stating 'some people even invited me to go out with them!'.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">After a slighter later start (9:30am, GASP) the candidates were once again going through the paces of talking to students and making students aware of them both on and off campus, and addressing multiple lectures. Sometimes, the same lecture twice in a row.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Walker was intent on making her presence known throughout the day, with the unveiling of her Walker 4 Welfare banner. This proved to be a big hit with students, with one Arts student saying 'it&rsquo;s nice to see something different from the same old leaflets and t-shirts'.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">In the lectures each candidate took a different angle, N\u00ed Chonaire touting her experience, Haughey his policies and Walker doing a little bit of both. Both N\u00ed Chonaire and Walker received positive responses to their campaigns overall. N\u00ed Chonaire's experience on the current welfare committee, and as a VDP activites co-ordinator resonated well with many students. However it was Haughey&rsquo;s\u00a0\u00a0strong delivery, engagement with students, polling them on their awareness of student counseling services and emphasising the worrying increase in death by suicide which stuck with students. One 2<sup>nd</sup>\u00a0year described him as 'the only candidate I remember'.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Then the hustings began. Braving the cold, all candidates could be seen preaching their message to the college community from the Dining Hall steps. Despite the disappointing turnout, Welfare candidates made sure to leave an impression on those present.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">N\u00ed Chonaire received the largest, warmest\u00a0response from the crowd. She was quick off the mark to emphasise that Welfare is 'not a competition between whose the nicest' &ndash; possibly a dig at my comments in yesterday&rsquo;s blog. Rather, she said it is about who is most suited for the job, who has the most\u00a0experience and who can help\u00a0the student body the most.\u00a0Policies were explained in a bit more depth than in her manifesto, explaining her intention to use social media and designated Welfare noticeboards to increase awareness. She also explained that she has in fact looked into the logistics of setting up a specified 'Welfare App' and stated that it was perfectly achievable and has been a success in other colleges.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Haughey expanded on those policies found in his manifesto. He would be open to changing the ordering of SHAG Week and Mental Health week, in order to give both equal platforms. He also added that, given the unfortunate rise of students not being able to extend their expenditure to food, he would store some in his office for those students in need, 'because sometimes you just need a Pot Noodle'. He also stated a dissatisfaction with the current free condoms available to students, believing that students would be more willing to take them if they were 'a brand they trusted'.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Walker focused on one of her core policies, the need to encourage active integration within college. Focusing particularly on incoming first years, she emphasised that there had been some confusion over her manifesto. She 'does not want to abolish Student2Student', and apologised for any mis-communication. Rather, she stated that she would like to see the establishment of 30 or so college aids who would help integrate 1<sup>st</sup>\u00a0years into college and help them find the societies which would suit them best in the new environment of college. She once again emphasised her desire to place free pregnancy tests in the welfare office, along side\u00a0the current condom service.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">When asked if Welfare had become viewed as an officer most suited to girls, all candidates were noticeably shocked. Each stated their total disagreement with the view. Haughey believes it should not be the case at all, but no matter what you will find that girls can be most comfortable talking to girls, and guys with guys.\u00a0\u00a0N\u00ed Chonaire said it should not be an issue in any instance of gender and that it&rsquo;s part of making people aware that welfare is there for you no matter what. Walker similarly agreed with both her opponents and explained that, because there has\u00a0been two consecutive years of female welfare officers, there are entire years in college who don&rsquo;t know any different,\u00a0 which, unfortunately, breathes those kind of attitudes.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Then it was onto the QSoc Hustings, which took place in the MacNeill theatre at 5. This was always going to be an intense questioning of the candidates,as there race, more than any other, will effect Trinity&rsquo;s LGBT community.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Walker wanted to make clear that her manifesto corresponds quite closely with the goals of QSoc. She expressed her admiration of the &ldquo;Introductions\" program run by the society and wished to emulate it in her college integration policy. 'Welfare' she said 'isn&rsquo;t something you can cut', and used this to reassure those in attendance that the Pink program would continue in the event of USI disaffiliation, having contacted the USI&rsquo;s own Welfare officer.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">N\u00ed Chonaire talked of how she would integrate LGBT awareness into general Welfare awareness. She stated she would like to see an increased involvement of Q.Soc in Rainbow week. Her 'Help a Friend Workshops' would include teaching students a way to support friends who are coming out or experiencing issues related to sexuality. She also said she would work to combat online bullying.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Haughey detailed his involvement with Q.Soc since first year, and thus his awareness of LGBT issues in college. In particular he touted the need for increased accessibility of information to students, of all orientations, on LGBT issues. He outlined his desire to establish a series of 'It Gets Better' video&rsquo;s in college as a show of peer support to struggling students.\u00a0He end with THE Iconic line from Lady GaGa&rsquo;s 'Born This Way', which was arguably the most well received &lsquo;policy&rsquo; of all electoral candidates.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Then the questioning began.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">First, how would they help transgender students in particular within college? Each candidate explained how sexuality of any kind will never be an issue, and they will campaign in college based on that. Haughey stated we need to help those who struggle to understand that sexuality shouldn&rsquo;t be a concern or problem, N\u00ed Chonaire explained the need for them to feel comfortable talking and within college, and Walker explain the need to let students know gender shouldn&rsquo;t define who you are.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">When asked how they would expand Rainbow Week, each candidate took a different vantage point.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Walker stated that it tied in with her policy of establishing an Identity week and the two could become aligned in some way. She would get all the Sabbats involved in supporting the week and work with Ents to get a designated LGBT night out.\u00a0\u00a0N\u00ed Chonaire stated the need to extend it to all students so as to not pigeon hole it as a week just for the LGBT community. She said she would look at the events and policies established by BeLonGTo and learn from them. Haughey stated that the week is 'MegaLols' for those involved and there is not a reason why it should not extend to non-LGBT students, touting a 'Bring a Straight Friend' night as an example.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">When asked on her policy of increasing class rep involvement in welfare, Aisling stated it was the responsibility of the class rep to be representative of the Sabbats within their class, and would make sure to emphasis next year that their duties go beyond just organising class nights out. She intends for the general message of the SU on welfare to filter down following this.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Lastly, all three were asked what there one big campaign point would be next year.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Walker stated that Bullying, related to sexuality in particular, would be her focus. Haughey stated that it would be his &ldquo;It gets better' video project. N\u00ed Chonaire then explained that while she agreed with the idea of the video's, we need to insure students that they should not be defeated now and would actively campaign for equality in college with LGBT allies.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">And then they all collapsed from exhaustion.\u00a0Well no. I hope they didn't.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Poor things are wrecked already.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>", "Imageurl": "8321", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8153", "Heading": "Welfare blog: Day 2"}
