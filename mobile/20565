Though a majority of the meeting indicated a preference for the proposal, only three undergraduates were present, the subset of the college community where the measure enjoys the least support. Furthermore, the low turnout allowed members of the TFT committee to dominate discussion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The meeting styled itself as an independent and non-prescriptive consultation but this came into question from the very beginning of the meeting when attendees were presented with leaflets on how to quit smoking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the meeting provided an insight into the motivation behind the proposal. Members of the committee, in defending the proposal, were most keen to stress the potential impact of the ban in denormalising smoking among students and making it easier for students to quit. The prestige of the college was mentioned as a secondary issue.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The main objections raised to the proposal were practical rather than principled, with only two students, both undergraduates, questioning whether such a measure was a proper exercise of College power. Issues raised were: crowding at the entrances, policing, residents and a possible loss of business for the Pav. While these issues were discussed, with policing seeming to be the matter of most concern, no definitive solutions were found.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The University Times has also obtained a breakdown of the survey of college members last May on the feasibility of the project. While overall College was split 54% in favour, 37% against and 9% unsure, the proposal was much more popular amongst staff (65%) than undergraduates (50%). Unsurprisingly, of respondents who identified themselves as daily smokers, 86% were against the proposal.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tobacco Free Trinity urges students to show up in greater number to the next meetings, the first of which takes place at 5pm on Tuesday 22 October in the Smurfit Institute, LTEE 3, followed by another meeting at 1pm on Wednesday 23rd in the Edmund Burke Theatre.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DSC_0482.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20565", "Heading": "Tobacco Free Trinity Town Hall Meetings Begin"}
