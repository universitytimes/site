That&rsquo;s how long Roberto Di Matteo lasted as the manager of Chelsea\nFootball Club. His firing comes on the back of a 3-0 defeat to Juventus that leaves\nthe club in the unenviable position of potentially being the first ever holders of\nthe Champions League Trophy to be sent packing while still in the group stages.\nAccording to a club statement \"The team's recent performances and results have not\nbeen good enough and the owner and the board felt that a change was necessary\nnow to keep the club moving in the right direction as we head into a vitally important\npart of the season.\"\n\nMake no mistake; this decision was made solely by Roman Abramovich, the Czar\nof Chelsea who ruthlessly rules over club affairs. Eight managers have come and\ngone since the Russian purchased the club less than ten years ago and although\nDi Matteo was the general who fulfilled his leader&rsquo;s ambition by conquering Europe,\nthere was always a sense that he was living on borrowed time.\n\nHe had been brought in as a caretaker manager in March and embarked on a\nsimply sensational run, winning over the notorious Chelsea dressing room before\nleading them to victories in the finals of the FA Cup and the Champions League. This\nseason started brightly, with the flair and dynamism of Eden Hazard and Juan Mata\ncombining to wreak havoc with opposition defenses. However, two points from the\nlast four matches was enough to prompt the always trigger-happy owner to relieve Di\nMatteo of his duties.\n\nSpeculation now turns to who will replace him. Even before Di Matteo was given a\ntwo-year contract in June, speculation was rife that Pep Guardiola, the man behind\nBarcelona&rsquo;s domination of European football was Abramovich&rsquo;s favourite for the\njob. Guardiola is currently taking a year-long sabbatical in New York however and is\nbelieved to have no intention of cutting it short. There are also doubts that he would\naccept the offer, bearing in mind the managerial merry-go-round that Chelsea has\nbecome.\n\nFor that reason, Rafa Benitez, the former Liverpool manager has thrown his hat into\nthe ring. Speaking to Sport360 he said &ldquo;I am looking for a club that can challenge\nfor trophies and Chelsea is one of these clubs.\" How long he would last is another\nmatter but it would surprise no one if he was offered the job just until the end of the\nseason, allowing Abramovich to use his powers of persuasion, and his deep pockets,\nto convince Guardiola to come to Stamford Bridge.", "Imageurl": "13593", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dimateo3", "ID": "13592", "Heading": "Care Free Wherever We May Be: Who's Next To Manage CFC?"}
