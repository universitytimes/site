The above image, fondly referred to as Socially Awkward Penguin, relates to none other than myself, and an incident in Junior Fresh year. I was searching for an English tutorial, and I was very late. The assigned room on my timetable was distressingly empty, but in the room right beside it I could hear a tutor starting up class. I walked in briskly and sat down, but quickly realised that people were giving me strange looks&hellip; After the first 5 minutes it became apparent that this was a class on childhood language acquisition, and not even a first year one at that. Constant references to &ldquo;last year&rsquo;s course&rdquo; and phrases such as &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve covered all this before&rdquo; lead me to the realisation that they were, in fact, third years. Third years who knew, therefore, that I did not belong. My subsequent embarrassment and social paralysis was such that I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to get up, to laugh it off and breeze out of the room. No, no, I brazened it out for the next 45 minutes, pretending to take notes on Noam Chomsky and phonemes. My relief when the bell finally rang was cut short when it became clear that this was a two-hour tutorial, and the tutor was using this opportunity to hand around a sheet for names and email addresses. Just as I was about to fake a fit of the vapours, it was suggested that we also use this time to go to the bathroom. I ran, I ran as I have never run before. I later discovered that our English tutorial had not started yet, and would indeed take place in the classroom right beside the one I had been in earlier. Four weeks later, at the first English tutorial, some ingenious disguise would be necessary. I wore a hat.</p>\n</div>\n<div>You will now understand that, given my talent for entangling myself in this type of predicament, it was only a matter of time before something similar happened here. Said inevitability has just occurred. Ever since I&rsquo;ve arrived, my confidence in my ability to speak French has skyrocketed. That&rsquo;s the whole point of Erasmus I suppose. I&rsquo;ve secured bus cards, a bank account, an apartment, I described the limitations of a coeliac diet to a rude French waiter for Christ&rsquo;s sake, I&rsquo;m unstoppable! A tad uppity, some would say. Well fear not, I have been swiftly returned to a state of sadly shaking my head and saying &ldquo;Non, non, j&rsquo;ai pas compris.&rdquo;It is 11am, I am leaving my apartment block, I notice an old man at the end of the street, and as I get closer he points roughly in my direction, says something, and laughs. I presume it is something to do with my wearing a jumper in 31-degree heat and laugh good-naturedly with him. It is at this moment that another man pops up from the boot of a car in front of him, holding a suitcase, also laughing, and clearly saying something in reply. I realise that he wasn&rsquo;t, in fact, even pointing at me, but at a collection of traffic cones and a sign about car parking spaces. He really is looking at me now though, with a huge smile on his face, delighted that I understood his joke as well. He says something to his friend and they both turn to me with friendly smiles, and one asks me a question. In German. Shit. It is time to laugh again, but this time it is that awkward I-have-no-idea-what-you&rsquo;re-saying laugh, and I nonchalantly walk past them, seemingly still laughing at some kind of question and muttering &ldquo;ja, ja.&rdquo;\n\n</div>\n<div><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5163\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5163\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-5163\" title=\"Brauders apartment\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Brauders-apartment-1024x764.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"614\" height=\"458\" /></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>The socially awkward fear sets in as I sit in class. I desperately try to put together viable sentences in German from the only source I have at my disposal; Goethe&rsquo;s Wanderer&rsquo;s Night Song, which we had to learn off in 3rd year for Junior Cert. music. I devise a cunning plan whereby I advise them that the mountains are very peaceful and I think the birds are asleep in the trees before looking at my watch, acting surprised, miming that I am late, and rushing into my apartment. Years of silent improvisation games in drama class will finally, finally pay off.</div>\n<div>\n\nWhen I get home the men are nowhere to be seen, but their car rests outside ominously, a warning that they will return, I will see them, and this time laughing hysterically won&rsquo;t cut it. In the same way that I could not stand up in first year and say &ldquo;Oh, sorry, wrong class!&rdquo; I now cannot even consider playing dumb next time I see them, or apologising and admitting that I don&rsquo;t speak German. Besides, that old man looked so happy that I understood him! I will have to learn. Thus I reveal to you one of my great talents (some would say fault) in life: making mountains out of molehills. Aus einer M\u00fccke einen Elefanten machen in German, as my dear old friend Google tells me. I am now an Irish Erasmus student, studying English, in a French university, trying to teach herself German on the side. Do wish me luck.\n\n</div>", "Imageurl": "5158", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5157", "Heading": "A Year Abroad: Fear and self loathing in Nice"}
