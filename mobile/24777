{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Hannah Ryan</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"> | News Editor</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>The University Times</em> has learned that 559 students (3% of the student body; 320 undergraduates and 239 postgraduates) were deemed withdrawn from Trinity in Hilary Term of this year, having failed to complete College&rsquo;s full registration process before December 20, 2013. Some of the students affected had paid their fees in full but had not completed other administrative procedures necessitated by the college.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many of these students only checked their TCD e-mails in the week before Hilary Term, to discover that they had been made withdrawn during the break. By this point they had lost access to the library, college network accounts, Blackboard and information such as course timetables.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By the end of October 2013, 2,000 students remained unregistered, prompting the decision to defer application of the College Calendar regulation whereby &ldquo;students who [did] not register by November 15, 2013 would be deemed withdrawn and services such as library, College email account and TCD ID cards [would] be suspended automatically.&rdquo; This deadline was pushed to December 20; thereafter, students would have to apply for re-admission and pay a fee of &euro;358.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dr Laudet outlined their shared view &ldquo;that the information given to students at the time of fee payment and registration is not as clear as it could be.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On January 17 Senior Tutor Dr Claire Laudet and Dean of Students Amanda Piesse sent an email to the Senior Lecturer, the Vice Provost and others, formally requesting that the re-admission fee be waived for students who had been made withdrawn, and that those who had already paid the fee be refunded. Dr Laudet outlined their shared view &ldquo;that the information given to students at the time of fee payment and registration is not as clear as it could be. A number of the students who have been made withdrawn had paid their student contribution in good time and were convinced that they had registered.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dr Laudet further expressed concern that: &ldquo;Many of these students have indicated that they would have difficulties meeting the cost of the fee and have expressed quite negative opinions about the way the issue was handled by College. Given the teething problems encountered with SITS [the College student administration system], we believe it would demonstrate good will on behalf of College to waive the re-admission fee and facilitate the readmission of these students.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Head of the Academic Registry, Leona Coady, then contacted the parties involved, speaking in defence of the SITS system. Ms Coady wrote, &ldquo;students who do not register within seven days of receiving the invitation to register, are automatically sent a system-generated reminder to complete registration&rdquo;, and added that further email notifications were sent to students in October/November and December along with follow-ups by Schools/Course Offices, the Senior Tutor&rsquo;s Office and the Students&rsquo; Union.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Since the implementation of SITS, the rates of students being &lsquo;deemed withdrawn&rsquo; are in fact down by approximately 50%.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students eligible for a local authority/SUSI grant were warned via email that the college would be &ldquo;unable to provide the funding body with confirmation of [their] registration until completed in full&rdquo;, while students intending to sit Foundation Scholarship examinations in January could not be scheduled for the exams &ldquo;on the basis of their unregistered status&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The communications and instructions were clear,&rdquo; Ms Coady affirmed. &ldquo;Students in doubt of their registered status could verify it in the portal and/or contact the Academic Registry.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ms Coady also cited the fact that, &ldquo;since the implementation of SITS, the rates of students being &lsquo;deemed withdrawn&rsquo; are in fact down by approximately 50% due to our ability now to track and follow up directly with students.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nevertheless, the 559 students who had not completed registration and had not contacted the Academic Registry with a &ldquo;legitimate issue&rdquo; were made withdrawn on December 19/20, 2013.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking in opposition to the proposed &ldquo;blanket waiver of the fee&rdquo; in January, Coady stated: &ldquo;The mandatory requirement for students to register is critically important not least for the purposes of returning student statistics to the HEA which determine the College&rsquo;s core grant allocation. It is vitally important that students register on time so as not to be excluded from the statistics which would reduce the College&rsquo;s funding stream.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It is vitally important that students register on time so as not to be excluded from the statistics which would reduce the College&rsquo;s funding stream.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Vice-Provost/Chief Academic Officer then made the following decisions: the readmission fee would be waived for students who had paid their fees in full but did not complete registration; for all students on the Trinity Access Programme Foundation courses; and for cases of &ldquo;specific genuine hardship or other issues&rdquo; considered individually by the Senior Lecturer or the Dean of Graduate Studies &ldquo;in line [with] current practice&rdquo;. The &euro;358 was not waived for students who had paid only part of their fees, or for funded students who failed to complete registration. The Academic Registry was tasked with processing applications for readmissions based on these decisions.</p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Senior Lecturer Dr Patrick Geoghegan told </span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">The University Times</em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">: &ldquo;[The Vice-Provost&rsquo;s decision] eased the pressure on a number of students whose cases had come to my office. Since then we have waived the fee for all of the recommendations sent to us by the Senior Tutor (acting for the tutors).&rdquo;</span>\r\n\r\nGeoghegan continued: &ldquo;This issue should not be a persistent annual problem. We have identified the source of the confusion and have been promised that a fix will be developed in time for the next academic year.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n<em>Photo by Gearoid Gibbs</em>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/12643185315_23bebeb575_z.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24777", "Heading": "Registration Difficulties Led to Withdrawal of 559 Students from College in 2013/14"}
