On the 24th until the 25th of September private messages sent before and during 2010 were temporarily available to view on the profile pages of each user.\n\nThe issue first came to light in France where many people noticed that their private messages from before 2010 were posted on users&rsquo; timelines. It is said that, as a result of the rollout of the timeline layout across the Facebook community, the change in programming between then and now may have caused the privacy breach to occur.\n\nThe internet company, which boasts some 955 million active users worldwide, has since denied any form of privacy infringement and states that all the messages were already previously viewable. Facebook quickly released a statement claiming those who had noticed the issue are just unable to recall sending the messages as wall posts. They referred to how, in previous years, wall posts were far more common and less users were conscious of the possible security problems that their comments could lead to.\n\nHowever, many users are still adamant that their messages were available to view even after the Facebook statement. One student told The University Times that &lsquo;on Tuesday (September 25th) I heard about the issue and immediately went to check if it was true. Sure enough there were my messages on show.&rsquo; Furthermore, many users have come to seriously question the security of their private information. A number of students have informed this reporter that they have shut down their Facebook accounts completely due to the scare and concern over what effect such alleged privacy breaches may have on employment prospects.\n\nAs it stands, the issue seems to have been rectified despite Facebook&rsquo;s denial of any error in the first place. One user, who was able to see his messages on his timeline two days ago, cannot find any trace of them ever being there now. He stated that &lsquo;it seems strange that my private messages were definitely there to view two days ago but now, after Facebook has said there was never any issue and they were just wall posts, I can&rsquo;t see them.&rsquo;\n\nWhatever the case, this alleged \u00a0privacy transgression may hurt the reputation of the world&rsquo;s leading online social networking platform. Facebook&rsquo;s share price has slumped by 45% since the initial stock market flotation in May of this year. User fears concerning security may further hamper the tech giant's efforts to shake off concerns over its long term viability.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Did you notice any of your private messages appearing as wall posts on your timeline?
