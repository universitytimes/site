{"Body": "Matthew Rye\n\nIreland&rsquo;s recent underdog victory against England at the Cricket world Cup isn&rsquo;t a result that any Irish sports follower should take lightly. It&rsquo;s the type of win that marks a hard-fought transition for the Irish side, from an outlier position to a role on the main stage. It&rsquo;s the type of victory which is not won solely by the performance of those on the field, but also by the years of struggle and effort put in by an entire generation of players.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2593\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"O&#39;Vrien celebrates victory against England\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/o_brien_gty_1838909c.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2593\" title=\"o_brien_gty_1838909c\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/o_brien_gty_1838909c-300x187.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"187\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nWhile one victory against Pakistan in the last World Cup could have been labelled lucky, two consecutive World Cup upsets have christened Ireland as Giant Killers among the so-called &ldquo;associate&rdquo; nations. Bangladesh, Pakistan, England. In a few years&rsquo; time, under the right conditions, Ireland could scalp New Zealand or the West Indies. From there, test cricket could be integrated, allowing Ireland to progress further into the international circuit.\n\nThe victory against England can further be attributed to the sheer force of unpredictability that is Kevin O&rsquo;Brien.\u00a0\u00a0Coming into this match, he&rsquo;d had a lacklustre innings against Bangladesh and the Irish team was looking out of its depth at the crease. Swann, Strauss and Anderson all looked like they&rsquo;re comfortable and in control. Swing, smack, six, repeat. 60 balls later Kevin O&rsquo;Brien leaves the field a world cup record holder with the fastest century, eclipsing greats such as Adam Gilchrist and Sachin Tendulkar. He batted faultlessly against all the different elements of the England bowling attack. Strauss looked absolutely flabbergasted. He couldn&rsquo;t find the right strategy. Every time a ball was pitched wide or short, O&rsquo;Brien pummelled it mercilessly into the stand.\n\nO&rsquo;Brien epitomises the Irish Cricketing game; resilient, hard-working and with little bursts of talent throughout. Although it requires a team effort to win at any form of the international game, Ireland&rsquo;s victory will be remembered for O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s world class display, built upon years of growth and development by the Irish national side.\n\nHowever, it could be argued that the Kevin O&rsquo;Brien Show is a highlight of an otherwise disappointing World Cup for the Irish team in terms of results. Beating Bangladesh at home is difficult, but not impossible, as teams like South Africa and England showed with consummate ease. Solid performances against India and the West Indies were met with disappointing results. Such is the nature of the game.\n\nIreland&rsquo;s seemingly exponential rise into the cricketing world is remarkable, considering the squad only gained to right to play in ODI matches in 2006. But it can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, full homage must be paid to the International Cricket Council. The ICC has identified Ireland as a potential new market for cricket to evolve and increase in popularity. It has a developed level of infrastructure compared to some of the other countries in contention for ICC funding, as well as a keen national interest in sport.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2594\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"One of the most under-rated cricket teams\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/118129_ireland.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2594\" title=\"118129_ireland\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/118129_ireland-300x208.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"208\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nThe funding the Irish Cricket Union has received has allowed for contracts to be awarded to several of the side&rsquo;s key players including record-setter Kevin O&rsquo;Brien, although rumours of an Indian Premier League contract continue to circulate among the league&rsquo;s press officers. These contracts allow for the continued nurturing of cricketing talent at international level, provoking better national sides, better international results and more interest in the game at grassroots level. More young people will be playing cricket in Ireland next year because Kevin O&rsquo;Brien consistently smashed Anderson through extra cover for four. Young Players like the enigmatic George Dockrell will continue to bloom and grow, although at 18, taking Sachin Tendulkar for LBW might turn out to be the young man&rsquo;s career highlight. This phantom funding from the ICC also reaches cricket clubs around Ireland, which can buy better facilities to attract youth. Such talented youth comes in the form of Eoin Morgan and Ed Joyce, who have made a name for themselves abroad by playing for the England ODI side.\n\nThe million-dollar question comes when the ICU asks where they see the side in twenty year&rsquo;s time. England will continue to push for hosting rights to the ICC World Cup. If a situation should arise where England&rsquo;s bid would fall short due to lack of facilities, the ICU could be in a position to allow the use of Irish facilities.\n\nGone are the days of losing to Middlesex, Kevin O&rsquo;Brien and company know their boundaries and are intent on pushing them to the limit.", "Imageurl": "2593", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2592", "Heading": "Cricket progress the result of years of hard work"}
