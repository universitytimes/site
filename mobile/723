{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>We all know the scene: its 7am, every shrill note of the alarm clock is piercing through your skull; the morning light is streaming through the curtains and scorching your delicate retinas and somewhere in the back of your mind is the sickening realisation that A: you have a tutorial in 45 minutes and B: you&rsquo;re still drunk. Yes people, it&rsquo;s time to rise and shine.</p>\n<p>After ten to fifteen minutes of the kind of mental preparation that is worthy of a Japanese samurai, your just about ready to leap from the bed and greet a new day full of exciting possibilities and rewarding challenges. You fling the covers back from your bed, swing your legs out and make the first step towards another great college day. Alas, things do not go according to plan. Upon feet to floor contact, you come to the conclusions that not only are you still drunk; you also seem to have lost the ability to remain standing for more than 5 seconds. Feeling defeated (and ridiculously queasy), you collapse back onto the bed, on the way down, you fall into a pile of political science readings, the papers fly everywhere in a flurry of fools cap and journal articles and you sink back into your only friend, the duvet. The scene is a disaster, your bedroom has, to quote ABBA, become your waterloo.</p>\n<p>Yes, since becoming a university student, the early morning tutorial (or EMT as it shall now be known) has become my sworn enemy. I can honestly say that seeing the words &ldquo;9am, tutorial, arts block&rdquo; on my timetable instils me with more fear than any of the Saw movies did. And the situation doesn&rsquo;t get any easier when you&rsquo;re sober. Many a time I have tucked myself into bed on a Wednesday night, consciously knowing that I have a dreaded EMT coming up the next morning. With a nice cup of tea, and one of Maeve Binchy&rsquo;s classics (Tara Road guarantees that I&rsquo;m asleep in less than 12 seconds), I feel that I&rsquo;m setting myself up for the kind of night&rsquo;s sleep which will undoubtedly leave me refreshed and ready to tackle even the most pedantic of teaching assistants.</p>\n<p>How wrong can one person be? 16 hours later I wake up. Its 4pm, my EMT has been and gone, and a Maeve Binchy classic is lying upside down on floor looking as if it has been hit by a tornado. The battlefield scene is tragic but all too common. The casualty: my chances of getting a 2:1, the aggressors: my comfy bed and an evil timetable. The battle against the EMT has been lost yet again.</p>\n<p>I have often asked myself what is it that makes it so difficult for me to muster the energy required to wake up on time. Suggested reasons have ranged from not so likely (Leading a mysterious double life as a crime-fighter after dark) to more plausible excuses (incurable laziness and a bed that is just TOO comfortable). Whatever the reason, the situation appears only to have become a problem since starting my time in college. Back when I was in school, 9am starts (though not particularly palatable) were just something which I did automatically, maybe even without thinking. Perhaps the reason for this is that my university timetable lacks the regularity of its secondary school counterpart. Indeed, so irregular and unpredictable is my timetable that I have bestowed upon it the affectionate nickname of &ldquo;lady gaga&rdquo; since, like its namesake, it looks unrecognizably different every day and gets scarier the more I look at it.</p>\n<p>Dodgy timetables and erotically charged pop superstars aside, I think that it&rsquo;s safe to say that the EMT and its even more abhorrent sibling the EMS (Early morning seminar) are here to stay, so I might as well get used to the idea of actually leaving my bed before midday, right? Well, that&rsquo;s the plan, but alas, my body clock has different ideas. An increasingly bizarre cycle of &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; reruns, lectures, Pav Fridays, house parties the odd bit of library time has led to my body clock going into some sort of weird frenzy, the kind you might expect to see in an animal as it emerges from months of hibernation. At 2am, I&rsquo;m filled with bursting energy, I could take on the world, but at 8am, it is all I can do to stay conscious during the long trudge to the bus stop. Likewise, at dinnertime, I&rsquo;m not all that hungry (mainly since lunchtime only really starts at 4pm) but by 1am, my stomach is crying out for food and a flit to the kitchen under cover of darkness is inevitably on the cards.</p>\n<p>So what can I conclude from this brief investigation into my bizarre sleeping habits and lack of enthusiasm for college before 12pm? You might call me lazy, and I completely agree! But whether you consider yourself to be a &lsquo;Devoted Deborah&rsquo; or &lsquo;Waster Wendy&rsquo;, I challenge anyone reading this article to confidently stand up and say that they have never once lost their battle with the EMT and opted to stay tucked up warm and cosy in their beds instead of braving the elements (and a dodgy bus system) to make it into college for 9am.</p>\n<p>So as I save my article, brush my teeth and tuck myself into bed ready for tomorrow&rsquo;s battle to be on time for class, I like to adopt an approach favoured by one of the greatest philosophers of our time: Kesha. She advises us to &ldquo;wake up in the morning feeling like P Diddy&rdquo;. And while Colin McGrane may be on the attendance list for 9am Political Science, P. Diddy most certainly is not - Sorted.
