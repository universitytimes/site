Therefore, University Times College Correspondent and all round nice guy Barra Roantree is going to review these questions and will be free to comment, criticise, add or delete in the interests of fairness as he sees fit.\n\nRemember, the whole point of these question and answer blogs is to get the candidates to clarify and expand on the promises they are making in their own manifestos.
