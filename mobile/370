{"Body": "<p>Trinity has been&nbsp; placed 43rd in the prestigious Times Higher Education/QS World University Ranking. This is a jump of six places in just one year, a much applauded achievement leaving us ahead of such reputable establishments as London School of Economics and New York University. This performance is all the more remarkable given the financial pressures bearing down on higher education in the past year. We have also been ranked 13th amongst our European counterparts. Trinity Provost Dr John Hegarty said: &ldquo;Our stated ambition was to be at the front rank of world universities and among the top 50 globally. We have achieved that in a relatively short period of time and this year&rsquo;s ranking of 43rd place has surpassed that original goal.&rdquo; The QS World Rankings received a record level of responses this year from both the academic community and employers. This reflects the growing importance of&nbsp; the rankings globally. The Managing Director of QS observes that; &rdquo;Governments and Universities are investing to increase their profile and recognition on the international stage as higher education becomes a global industry. Today the QS World University Rankings are used by employers identifying from where to recruit, academics choosing where to work and with whom to form partnerships and by parents and students looking to make sound education decisions.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The U.S. however still dominates with Harvard placed 1st for the sixth year running. In the top 10 alone six of the universities are in the US, with the other four being in the UK. There is evidence however that this US dominance is starting to slip. While it still has by far the most institutions in the top 200, with a total of 54, it has lost five institutions from the top 100 and four have dropped out of the top 200 altogether.
