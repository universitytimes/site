This will see DARTs and DART stations across Dublin sporting a series of 12 posters engaging people with witty quips like, &ldquo;Everyone on the DART is attracted to you&hellip;gravitationally.&rdquo; Instead of taking amusement from transit maps and gum-riddled seats, DART commuters can now enjoy a plethora of physics-related humor, fun facts and &ldquo;wow statements&rdquo; intended to capture people&rsquo;s interest. This was Chief Executive of Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann, David Franks&rsquo; reason for getting involved; simply put, this &ldquo;campaign will entertain our customers on their commute.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Working to change the way people think about physics, Professor Colette Murphy and Aoibhinn N\u00ed Sh\u00failleabh\u00e1n of the School of Education teamed up with Dr. Jessamyn Fairfield of CRANN nanoscience institute. The result is DARTofPhysics. With the posters creating initial interest, people can access www.dartofphysics.ie to learn more.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">In the coming weeks, DARTofphysics will introduce a series of blogs dedicated to various physics topics to ensure appeal across demographics. These blogs were written by &ldquo;leading scientists and science enthusiasts around the globe,&rdquo; which promises a valuable level of information, while also keeping with the theme that physics is fun, interesting and available to everyone.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">DARTofPhysics has received funding from Trinity&rsquo;s Schools of Physics and Education as well as Science Foundation Ireland, Intel Ireland, the Metro Herald, IQ-Content, Language and Irish Rail.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Professor Colette Murphy suspects Dubliners will love the initiative because, &ldquo;DARTofPhysics is physics for Ireland&rdquo; and as we know, physics is fun and physics is beautiful. The goal is to get people interested and talking about physics. \u00a0In the words of Professor Bergin, &ldquo;DARTofPhysics will connect the Joe on the DART to the Josephine in the lab.&rdquo;</span>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DART-8113-near-Dun-Laoghaire-020308-2.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20786", "Heading": "School of Physics Launches DART Ad Campaign"}
