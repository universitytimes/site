{"Body": "<strong>Hilary Grubb</strong>\n<em>Staff Writer</em>\n\nThe BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth Journal has published a report on the comparative study on maternity care. The study was conducted jointly by the HSE and the school of Nursing and Midwifery, Trinity College Dublin.\n\nThe study, as a response to recommendations proposed in the Kinder Report of 2001, compared consultant based maternity care 5 of women admitted that their pain with midwifery led care. It proved that both were equally safe.\n\nMidwifery-led care used less intervention during pregnancy and in childbirth.\n57% of the women in consultant-led units (CLUs) had their births accelerated by having their waters broken or by being intravenously dripped with the chemical oxytocin. Some of the side effects that oxytocin can incur include allergic reaction, confusion, severe headaches, and swelling.\u00a0In the midwifery led units (MLUs), the number of women subjected to this was 17% lower than in the consultant led units.\n\nProfessor Cecily Begley of Trinity College Dublin was the principal investigator of the project that had 1653 participants from the HSE Dublin north-east area.\nResults demonstrated that in the MLU 6% fewer women chose to have epidurals than in the CLU. Dangers of epidurals include a small but definite risk of neurological injury and other serious, even life-threatening complications due to either human error such as over-dosing or misplacement of the medication, or allergy to the anaesthetic.\n\nAlternative methods of pain relief were invoked such as immersion in warm water birthing pools. In the MLUs 83% of women admitted that their pain relief was adequate whilst only 68% were satisfied in CLUs.\n\nIn addition to the physical benefits of the midwifery based care, it was lower in costs than consultant based care, proving to be &euro;332.80 less expensive.\n\nThe main principle underpinning this study was that midwifery led care, for low risk women, is most likely more beneficial to them during and after childbirth. \u00a0'Safety is our primary concern', Professor Begley stated 'and this study has shown conclusively that low-risk women receive safe care from both midwives and obstetricians.'", "Imageurl": "6604", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6594", "Heading": "Trinity Nursing School report published"}
