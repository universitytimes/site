{"Body": "<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Trinity has dropped nineteen places in the rankings of world universities\u00a0</span>compiled by Times Higher Education (THE), issued yesterday. Trinity now\u00a0stands as the 129th\u00a0university in the world according to THE.\r\n\r\nPhil Baty, editor of Times Higher Education rankings, spoke\u00a0of the academic and national consequences of this considerable drop:\r\n<blockquote>\"Trinity College Dublin's decline should be\u00a0cause for alarm. When the national flagship falls, it can affect the standing of the rest of the country.\"</blockquote>\r\nHe went on to add, \"However, at least University College Dublin and University College Cork both had strong years.\"\r\n\r\nBoth\u00a0UCD and UCC saw considerable jumps in rankings of around twenty places upwards, while Galway\u00a0and Maynooth saw no change in their positions.\r\n\r\nTrinity&rsquo;s Dean of Research, Vinny Cahill, reminded the public that Trinity did see an improved rank\u00a0concerning an increase in international students, particularly &ldquo;from emerging markets such as\u00a0Brazil, Russia, India and China.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nProfessor Cahill also noted that Trinity did not fumble on its research\u00a0income per academic staff, despite its overall fall in the Times Higher Education Rankings, and that the college did climb six places to 61st in the QS World University Rankings released last month. He\u00a0remains positive about the academic excellence of Trinity following\u00a0the release of the new rankings, and reminded the public that a joint effort in\u00a0improving Trinity&rsquo;s academic reputation, as well as the overall morale of Irish society and state of\u00a0its economy, needs to be carried out in conjunction with the Irish Government.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Trinity&rsquo;s ranking underlines\u00a0the need for more sustained public investment in higher education. It is important for Ireland, not\u00a0just for Trinity. Trinity, in partnership with Government, should work together in a co-investment\u00a0arrangement to foster the renewal of Ireland&rsquo;s society and economy.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/From-front-arch31.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19984", "Heading": "Trinity Slips in Times Higher Education Rankings"}
