{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"></strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Dublin, as a native, can be depressing. It rains. Our public transport is less than reliable. We&rsquo;re always here. Everything is familiar. Everything seems to be getting more and more expensive, our friends are gone abroad and everyone seems to be living a much more adventurous life. This year, I&rsquo;m checking in from Dublin. I&rsquo;m in that weird interim place of early-twenties. I&rsquo;ve just graduated and it seems like everyone around me has these insane plans: graduate and J1 visas for the USA, inter-railing, travelling the world, biding their time until September to start back studying for undergraduate, or embarking on a post-graduate in a different college. Then there&rsquo;s me.</span></p>\r\nI&rsquo;ve applied for countless jobs and yet this summer it seems like floundering is all I can do until I return, once again, to Trinity to start an M.Phil. I studied Irish Studies, and while there is (mystically) an Erasmus programme, we weren&rsquo;t really told about it. Due to my lack of employment, I&rsquo;ve never inter-railed, or gone on a J1 or been anywhere for any prolonged period of time. This year, I was so excited to get away from Dublin that right after my last exam I set off to Hamburg to see one of my best friends. It rained the whole three days I was there, but it was a great trip.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Adventuring-086.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17050\" alt=\"Adventuring 086\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Adventuring-086-1024x576.jpg\" width=\"610\" height=\"343\" /></a></p>\r\nWhile I was writing my dissertation and studying for my final exams, I felt like I was going to never get out of Dublin. Or Ireland. I&rsquo;m not in the right financial position to go abroad or move outside Dublin for a postgraduate. The claustrophobia was heightened by final year being spent going on anti-biotic after anti-biotic; I was left with little or no energy to do anything but sleep, eat and study. It was a perpetual banal cycle of suburb to city to library to city to suburb.\r\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When I got back from a rain-soaked Hamburg, I decided to make the best of what I had and do all the things in Dublin that a tourist would do. Granted, Trinity was not on that list. Or, you know, going on a shopping-spree in Carrolls. I&rsquo;m not one for Irish souvenirs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each year I take a walk around campus after exams to remember how nice Trinity actually is when you&rsquo;re not forced into the BLU complex for 12 hours a day. This summer is just that, only for all of Dublin. But, being a tourist in Dublin as a Dubliner can also be kind of tedious. I still have to get the same bus into town that goes along the same bus route as when I&rsquo;m in college, and join queues compiled of teenage language exchange students and when the bus is late I don&rsquo;t view it with a &ldquo;the Irish are so laid back&rdquo; attitude but a &ldquo;how hard is it to get a bus to go on schedule&rdquo; one.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Liffey-Cruise-037.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17054\" alt=\"Liffey Cruise 037\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Liffey-Cruise-037-1024x576.jpg\" width=\"610\" height=\"343\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If I compared this summer&rsquo;s productivity&rsquo;s to last year&rsquo;s I feel like I&rsquo;m wasting my summer. But as student of Irish history and culture, I&rsquo;m not. This is something I should have done years ago. \u00a0So far I&rsquo;ve been on a cruise along the River Liffey, strolled along the quays and seen the graffiti on Windmill Lane. (Although I think the street art around the corner on the quay is better). I&rsquo;ve been to the Guinness Storehouse, up to the Hellfire Club and to Rathfarnham Castle. At the Castle we admitted to being Dubs to the tour guide who replied in a strong English accent, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the way, you never explore what&rsquo;s under your nose.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve found the deer in Phoenix Park and had countless walks along the quays during sunset. The Little Museum of Dublin has been a highlight &ndash; it is quite possibly the quirkiest place with the most interesting collection of social and cultural history artefacts I&rsquo;ve ever found.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&rsquo;ve done a lot of research about this &ndash; and there is a never ending supply of things to do in Dublin for little or no money: Dun Laoghaire and Howth walks, the OPW cultural sites like Kilmainham Gaol, National Museums. Not to mention all the little festivals that pop up in Dublin during the summer: Bloom, World Street Performance Championships, 10 Days in Dublin, the Vodafone Comedy Festival, Marley Park. The list goes on.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Being a tourist in your locality in also kind of awesome</p>\n</blockquote>\r\nBut here&rsquo;s another thing about being a Dubliner in sunny Dublin &ndash; it&rsquo;s too hot. We&rsquo;re not equipped for long term good weather. And when we got the rain the past few days we hated it, too. We&rsquo;re perpetual moaners and groaners. It&rsquo;s one or the other, never in between.\r\n\r\nDublin is a place many want to go to and many want to leave, but after a little investigation; there&rsquo;s so much more left for me to discover. Even if I moan about it.", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Summer-stuff-012.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "17042", "Heading": "The Dublin Tragedy "}
