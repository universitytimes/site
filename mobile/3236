Following successful PGA tour finishes in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi, and total winnings surpassing $2.4 million, he capped off his summer with a faultless display en route to his first major title at the US Open in Bethesda, Maryland, vanquishing fears of the Ghost of Masters Past returning. Now, as the odds on favourite to become the first Northern Irish man to win the British Open, the question remains, will the 22-year-old have the mental fortitude to absorb the resident UK media pressure?\n\nBeing the youngest US Open winner since 1927 doesn&rsquo;t come without its fair share of baggage. Already parallels are being drawn to previous golfing prodigies, such as the great Bobby Jones and Tiger Woods. His tee-to-green consistencies, his approach shot accuracy, his drive length, his focus, his putting excellence. Many of the same attributes of those who achieved golfing greatness, our Rory has in spades. But whether his Masters nightmare will continue to haunt him remains in his own hands.\n\nAfter his convincing domination of the US Open field in Congressional Country Club in June, one of the factors which Rory attributed to his success was the media blackout which he imposed upon himself at the behest of his manager&rsquo;s, the legendary Chubby Chandler&rsquo;s, advice. With the absence of Twitter and mainstream media to divert his attention, Rory said he felt a weight had been lifted, which allowed him to spend more time focusing on gameplay and strategy. Whether or not he chooses to prescribe a similar blockade upon himself could prove to be the difference for the world&rsquo;s newest golf prodigy.\n\nMedia barriers might not be enough to prevent McIllroy from derailing on his way to his second major. A historically tough links course in the Royal St. George, Sandwich in Kent, combined with a field of seasoned links course veterans such as Phil Mickelson and Graeme McDowell, former winners such as Louis Oosthuizen and Stewart Cink, and world number one contenders Lee Westwood and Luke Donald. As well as this, the pressure on Rory can only be of a greater degree than that felt in Georgia or Maryland. The paradox that is home field advantage might not seem lost on Rory this weekend.\n\nWhat can be said of Rory McIllroy is that nobody can doubt his ability. Tee-to-green he as consistent, if not more so, than most of the players in the Open Championship field, and his putting has come on leaps and bounds since the Masters. His decision to not partake in this week practice round has been criticised by many, but he feels that he would be better off taking two days rest and being physically ready for the challenges the links course will bring. While this may seem careless and an unnecessary risk, it could be argued that McIllroy&rsquo;s previous experience on links course and being raised on Hollywood Golf Course gives him a distinct advantage over other players. He will be used to high winds and deep bunkers, something which the American players are not accustomed to.\n\nMcIllroy&rsquo;s momentary dominance of the world of golf is not a outlier which can be written off as a one-in-a-million chance. A snapshot of the competitive field in Kent next week will only more decidedly reveal what many of the leading US golfing pundits have already said in no uncertain terms. The width and breadth of the European Tour is beginning to dominate where the US Tour previously did. Four of the top five players in the world are now European. And European players consistently perform better in majors than their American counterparts.\n\nCurrently scheduled to become one of golf&rsquo;s biggest ever profit machines, a win for McIllroy this weekend will mean the 22-year olds earning potential will skyrocket past Nicklaus, Faldo, Montgomerie, and Mickelson. Which, if parallels are being drawn, isn&rsquo;t too bad for a golfing prodigy.", "Imageurl": "3237", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "3236", "Heading": "Golf's newest superstar has the world at his feet"}
