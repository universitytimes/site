What&rsquo;s the point of it? It&rsquo;s a cup which top clubs tend to disregard and therefore give other parties the sense that it&rsquo;s unimportant. For these clubs it&rsquo;s a lose-lose situation; if you go the whole way and win the trophy the victory is mocked due to the unimportant nature of the trophy. Similarly if you lose, well losing is never good. The trophy is perceived to be one which middle-to-lower Premier League teams might aspire to win or even top-end Championship sides for that matter. The FA Cup, the other English Cup is steeped in a tradition and history that will make it impossible for the League Cup ever to be considered equal. These are the thoughts of many. However I believe that this cup does in fact have a certain value, a value which is absent from any other competition in England currently. These values however are different depending on what type of club you support.\n\nFor top end clubs it offers these clubs an opportunity to first of all keep some fringe players match fit.\u00a0 More interestingly it is a chance to blend some youngsters into the team. Among supporters of different teams there are always mumblings heard of players in the youth setup that are meant to be great prospects. However due to the cut throat nature of the Premier League, where one slip-up can mean the difference between Europe or not, it is always a big risk to give these players a game, and rarely are they seen in the flesh. This risk is not present in the League Cup. Supporters rarely care if you are knocked out, especially if you are seen to bleed these youngsters. Arsenal are the greatest example of this where players such as Walcott, Wilshere, Gibbs and Oxlade-Chamberlain where all given their first taste of first team football for Arsenal in the cup. Admittedly it might not necessarily been their first appearance but in these cases the players were relied upon, rather than given fifteen minutes at the end of a comfortable win. The above players are now key members of the Arsenal squad and perhaps the League Cup has hastened this development in a positive manner. These matches I would argue are also special for fans that will always enjoy seeing players who are being developed from academies rather than purchased from other clubs.\n\nOf course a completely different benefit accrues to smaller clubs. The current competitive nature of the Premier League tends to protect the status quo. The higher you finish the more money you get to spend, the likelier you are to receive investment, and the greater chance you have of consolidating your position. The system is cyclical, and uninviting for smaller, &lsquo;doldrum&rsquo; clubs. This can be seen in how the same teams remain in the top four year on year, with the exception of Man City replacing Liverpool due to heavy investment. Therefore while the top teams do not prioritise the League Cup it is certainly a chance for a lower placed club to win a trophy of note. This is illustrated by the fact that last year Cardiff could only be separated from Liverpool by a penalty shoot-out. Furthermore considering Liverpool&rsquo;s recent decline into mediocrity, falling adrift from the top six, this is the sort of trophy which they can focus on. Birmingham were champions two years ago overcoming a clearly uninspired Arsenal side. They were later relegated from the Premier League highlighting that the opportunity to win such a trophy for even Championship teams is very much possible.\n\nSo for all its detractors the League Cup is certainly a tournament which truly offers something to every club, more so than any other competition in my opinion. It&rsquo;s perceived weaknesses could with a little bit of imagination be just as easily thought of as its strength. I say all this without even touching on the matter of the actual football. Inherent in the lack of risk attached to losing and the playing of youngsters ready to grab their chance, there is usually a thoroughly enjoyable brand of attacking football on display. Stunning, memorable matches include a group of Arsenal teenagers giving Sheffield United a footballing lesson as well as Aston Villa&rsquo;s epic 7-4 aggregate semi-final win over Blackburn will always live long in the memory, for me anyway. Simply put with football like that, what&rsquo;s there to complain about? Very little in my eyes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Notable Third Round Results:</em>\n\nWest Ham 1 &ndash; 4 Wigan\n\nLeeds 2 &ndash; 1 Everton\n\nChelsea 6 &ndash; 0 Wolves\n\nMan City 2 &ndash; 4 Aston Villa (Extra Time)\n\nMan United 2 &ndash; 1 Newcastle\n\nWest Brom 1 &ndash; 2 Liverpool\n\nArsenal 6 &ndash; 1 Coventry\n\nCarlisle 0 &ndash; 3 Spurs\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Selected Fourth Round Fixtures:</em>\n\nLeeds v Southampton\n\nNorwich v Spurs\n\nLiverpool v Swansea\n\nChelsea v Man United\n\nReading v Arsenal", "Imageurl": "12459", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12458", "Heading": "Long Live The League Cup"}
