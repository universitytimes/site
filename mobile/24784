{"Body": "<strong>Hannah Ryan</strong> | News Editor\r\n\r\nTrinity Cancer Soc may be charged up to &euro;2000 by the College Sports Centre for its Relay for Life event held last week, <em>The University Times</em> has learned. The centre was used to house volunteers overnight and the fee, as yet unconfirmed, will cover having staffed the centre for this purpose.\r\n\r\nHead of Sport &amp; Recreation Michelle Tanner told <em>The University Times</em> that &ldquo;the charge was an estimate for the staffing costs associated with the overnight event which the organisers were told about weeks in advance of the event. Obviously staff don&rsquo;t normally work through the night and we had to pay appropriate rates.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMs Tanner continued, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t charge for hire costs for any of the Sports spaces used or anything else for this 24 hour event. We will only be charging for the actual staff costs, which I believe will be lower than that estimated. We are of course fully supportive of the event and immense charitable efforts of the students.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRelay for Life garnered approximately &euro;3000 in funds for cancer research, minus costs. This fee from the Sports Centre reportedly means that Cancer Soc will incur considerable expenses from the college.\r\n\r\nDan McFadden, one of the organisers of the event, stated on behalf of Cancer Soc: &ldquo;We are delighted to have been allowed to run our 24-hour event on campus and we couldn't have done it without the use of the Sports Centre. We look forward to working with them on this amazing event again next year.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nRelay for Life, Trinity&rsquo;s first 24-hour on-campus event, took place from March 5-6, occurring primarily on the Cricket Pitch but moving into the Sports Centre overnight. A total of twenty teams took part in the event, with at least one member from each walking/running around the track at all times.\r\n\r\n<em>Photo by Sin\u00e9ad Baker</em>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1956981_10152035722499094_1147472428_o.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24784", "Heading": "Relay for Life Organisers Charged up to &euro;2000 by Sports Centre"}
