The motion proposed the incorporation of Mandela House, the alternative name of House 6 since 1988, into all Students&rsquo; Union communications relating to the building.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"The original sign that TCDSU displayed in support of the anti-apartheid campaign during the years Nelson Mandela was imprisoned can still be found above the doorway to Front Office.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking to <em>The University Times</em> about the proposal, O&rsquo;Raghallaigh stated: &ldquo;As TCDSU along with the wider study movement continue to play an important part in turning Ireland into a more egalitarian society, it's important that we show proper recognition for the achievements made by Nelson Mandela. Mandela House is the proper name for House 6... we ought to show respect for the great man and his legacy.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Taidhg</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">, an MPhil student of Medieval History who has been campaigning for the renaming of House 6 to Mandela House for some time, also commented on the motion: &ldquo;It was already policy, it was just about convincing people to use [the name], but there wasn't really the desire to do it - maybe due to the current crop of student&rsquo;s separation from the events which preceded Mandela's relief.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;I am happy that this is going ahead but I'm terribly sad that it took the death of the great man for people to think him worthy of this tribute.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TCDSU issued a post on their Facebook page on Friday to pay tribute to Mandela, stating: &ldquo;He will be remembered as a great political leader and a symbol of peace and hope.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Mandela House is the proper name for House 6... we ought to show respect for the great man and his legacy.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The statement continued, &ldquo;The Students' Union resides in House 6, which is also known as Mandela House. The original sign that TCDSU displayed in support of the anti-apartheid campaign during the years Nelson Mandela was imprisoned can still be found above the doorway to Front Office. It was officially unveiled on April 11th, 2000 to mark the visit of Nelson Mandela to Trinity College.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">President of TCDSU, Tom Lenihan expressed his wish to &ldquo;thank Nelson Mandela for his recognition of the support TCDSU gave him during his imprisonment&rdquo;, and said that \"he will always be a great world leader that captured the hearts of the students of TCD.&rdquo;</p>\r\nThe motion was passed by unanimous vote at the meeting of the Students' Union Council yesterday evening.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DSC_0005.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22605", "Heading": "SU Unanimously Passes Motion for the Renaming of House 6 to &ldquo;Mandela House\""}
