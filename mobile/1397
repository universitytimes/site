{"Body": "The presidential race has proved to have been one of the more eventful and tumultous races in the SU elections. It was a week of peaks and troughs with one day being incredibly eventful and the next being horrifically boring. We started off with three candidates and ended up with one unopposed. Democracy in action.\n\nLooking at the campaigns as a whole, there were a lot of on and off days. The campaigning kicked into full swing on the Sunday night, but surprisingly all three candidates were notably absent from campaigning in Halls early on Monday morning, where other campaigns including Welfare and Ents were present to catch the early morning students. However, they were definitely visible around campus. Students were stunned by Heffernan, who paraded through college with his smartly dressed campaign team and bodyguard, Prudence. The first hustings of the campaign were, to say the least, uneventful. It can be said though that all three candidates were bound to be somewhat nervous about what they were get- ting themselves into. The speeches by Bartlett and LeCocq were really\nnothing more than a reading of their manifestos aloud. Heffernan provided the entertainment after the dryness of his other presidential hopefuls. After the hustings, one of Bartlett&rsquo;s campaigners said that Hef- fernan will get sick of the race, and hinted to the possibility that he may pull out, a prediction which eventually proved true. However, on the other side, LeCocq&rsquo;s team said that Bartlett had underestimated them. Danny O&rsquo;Keeffe said that he put little effort into his campaign, &ldquo;We feel that Bartlett has under-estimated us and that he hasn&rsquo;t put in as much effort as he we would have if he thought we&rsquo;d be a challenge. So we think we&rsquo;re in with a fighting chance.&rdquo;\n\nTuesday saw the publishing of the first set of results for the University Times online poll, and boy did the results send shivers up the spines of Bartlett&rsquo;s team. Speaking to his campaigners, they were all somewhat shocked at their results, but still happy with their lead, which would soon diminish. The poll also proved that Heffernan didn&rsquo;t need to be in the Arts Block armed with manifestos to gain such a high result. Seb LeCocq was dismissive of the poll, and said it would encourage him to do better, &ldquo;The poll will simply help me and our team to do better in the actual elections&rdquo;. Ryan Bartlett canvassed the largest student residences on Tuesday and also campaigned in Trinity Hall.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1110\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Heffernan and Bartlett at the UT Presidential debate\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_1434.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1110\" title=\"IMG_1434\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/IMG_1434-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nWednesday saw LeCocq and Bartlett making their way to the nurses&rsquo; protest in St James. You know when they say &ldquo;when the cat&rsquo;s away the mouse will play,&rdquo; well this was cer- tainly the case in the campaign of Aaron Heffernan. He ran riot on campus while the other two went to St James&rsquo;. He kicked off his day by making lecture addresses on statistics and politics, which had his audience in fits of laughter. Accompanied by his entourage, he then &ldquo;officially&rdquo; opened the Book of Kells, which impressed students, tourists and the group of schoolgirls who he decided to appoint his &ldquo;sabbatical sisters&rdquo;. Heffernan then decided that there were too many books in the Arts Block, so decided to take the campaign to the Hamilton to win over the students down there.\n\nThursday and Friday proved equally quiet on the Presidential campaign trails, Heffernan decided to take Thursday off to relax and have a round of golf. Under the pressure of the poll results Bartlett&rsquo;s team held a stunt in the Arts Block, where the GAA lover and his team sang and danced to &ldquo;Everywhere We Go&rdquo;, while LeCocq attempted to win over voters by letting them play his Nintendo Wii.\n\nFriday was\u00a0the unwinding day after a long week for the candidates, Heffernan held a balloon modeling workshop in the Arts block, which his campaign manager branded as a &ldquo;hilarious disaster&rdquo; and also went to visit the nurses in D&rsquo;Olier street. The entourage entered a lecture theatre with Prudence dressed as a nurse and proceeded to begin a lecture address with the sentence, &ldquo;Hello nurses and their male friends.&rdquo; Little did the presidential hopeful know that they the lecture that they had decided to address was on gender equality in nursing.\nThe first shock was the decision by Sebastien Le Cocq to concede on Friday - perhaps the long week of campaigning and somewhat poor showing on the poll results had gotten to him. This move left only two in the race, with Bartlett promising to campaign a lot harder to regain ground lost to Heffernan.\n<blockquote>&ldquo;Seb decided to concede the race today and have his name taken off the ballot paper, that&rsquo;s a reflection of a couple of things: though Seb was a good candidate with good ideas, our campaign organisationally was flawed, but also because he was up against someone who has not only run as Obama for comic effect but also had an Obama-esque effect on the student body. In that regard we felt that we raised awareness. The EU hardship fund, a week ago nobody had heard of it. Now everyone in the college knows what it is. This isn&rsquo;t a reflection on Seb, theres two very strong caniddates out there at the minute, we feel Seb did a fantastic job and put in just as much work, if not more than everyone else, and basically, best of luck to the other two guys.&rdquo;\n\nFamous last words: LeCocq&rsquo;s campaign manager, Danny O&rsquo;Keeffe on the decision to pull out.</blockquote>\nThe Obama lookalike definitely knows the right way to impress students, and throughout the week he was without doubt the most talked about candidate in the race. Even though he is referred to as the joke candidate, he was the front-runner to the end, with over 55% in the most recent University Times poll. This definitely put the wind up the other candidates. Bartlett&rsquo;s campaign manager Daniel Ferrick admitted\u00a0his surprise and disappointment at Heffernan&rsquo;s poll result. &ldquo;I am surprised he is that far ahead, We are slightly disappointed with our rating but it will motivate our team to fight to show that Bartlett is the best man for the students in Trinity&rdquo;.\n\nThis opinion poll also could have been the deciding factor in Sebastien LeCocq deciding to pull out the of the race late on Friday afternoon. He had polled well below the other candidates at under 10%. When asked by the University Times on his decision he said, &ldquo;I have no comment to make, all I have to say is that I conceded this afternoon (Friday)&rdquo;. His campaign manager, Danny O&rsquo;Keeffe, was more forthcoming however. You can read his statement above right.\n\nAs students arrived to cast their votes in St James&rsquo; Hospital on Monday, they found both Heffernan and LeCocq&rsquo;s names scratched off the ballots. Heffernan campaign sources confirmed that he would be pulling out of the race at the Provostial debate on Monday night. By the time this reaches newsstands, the announcement will have been made.\n\nCiar\u00e1n Nolan", "Imageurl": "1437", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1397", "Heading": "War of Attrition for the Presidency"}
