It is utterly clear though that the time for reform of some kind has come. The Irish people, like their international counterparts, appear charged and ready to make their voices heard on this issue, as the tragedy of Savita's death underscores the need for some kind of clarity in the legal order.\n\nThat clarity, long overdue, is important. Paul Byron, the former Master of the National Maternity Hospital at Holles Street, said in an interview with RT\u00c9's\u00a0Morning Ireland radio programme that the lack of clarity on the abortion issue hung like a Sword of Damocles above the heads of those doctors who sought to act to save a woman in desperate need of medical attention as a result of the continuation of her pregnancy. This is simply unacceptable - doctors should be free to do the job they signed up for, to save lives, and to be able to act freely and exercise professional judgment without fear of legal retribution or personal punishment.\n\nThere are practical concerns. Calls for legislation to implement the details of the decision in\u00a0Attorney General v X\u00a0are all fine and well, but if the legislation is only a mirror of the judgment itself then questions need to be asked about what exactly that will achieve. Greater precision is needed, but the world isn't a video game, and life and the prospects of success aren't measured or displayed in percentages. That in itself presents a difficulty of considerable proportions.\n\nRestraint must be the order of the day here. Outrage at the death of Savita is understandable and warranted, but rushing into legislation on the tide of international outcry and hyperbole can only do more harm than good. A timely and measured response that maintains the protections afforded to unborn life while supporting women and delivering clarity about when our medical professionals can act (and how) should be what is being sought.\n\nAbortion is, and has been for some time, a uniquely national issue for Ireland, something we, the People, feel exceptionally passionately about. Since we met with our economic Waterloo, there has been much talk about sovereignty and self-governance. While our economic path is not one we forge alone at present, the power afforded to the government and the legislature is still a power bequeathed to it through the Constitution by the People. Our directions, our input, our beliefs are still the seat of power in Ireland, not international commentators or the pressure of the\u00a0mobilised\u00a0campaigners\u00a0.\n\nThis is a Constitutional issue. The People, with a capital P, are calling. The government must observe only the will of its People.", "Imageurl": "<strong>Graham Murtagh</strong>\n<em>Staff Writer</em>\n\nI've often been struck watching the evening news by the voracity and conviction of those on both sides of the Gaza conflict.
