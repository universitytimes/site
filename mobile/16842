{"Body": "<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">A Trinity student has again appeared in court on charges of computer hacking and is set to become one of the first people in the history of the state to be successfully prosecuted for such offences. Donncha O&rsquo;Cearrbhail and Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology student Darren Martyn are accused of hacking the official Fine Gael website before the 2011 General Election.</span><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"></strong>\r\n\r\nUnder the aliases &ldquo;Palladium&rdquo; and &ldquo;Raepsauce&rdquo;, the duo are said to have defaced the Fine Gael website on January 9th 2011, as well as taking it offline for 24 hours. Data was also stolen from the site and published elsewhere, including the contact details of up to 2,000 of its subscribers. The cost of repairing the website following the attack was almost &euro;10,000. Lawyers of O&rsquo;Cearrbhail and Martyn have stated that their defendants intend to plead guilty to the charges.\r\n\r\nThe hacking &ndash; which was described as &ldquo;a stunt to embarrass a political party rather than to disclose data to the public at large&rdquo; &ndash; has been condemned by Judge Ann Ryan as &ldquo;a terrible abuse of talent.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMr O&rsquo; Carroll, a medicinal chemistry student from Birr, Co. Offaly, also faces separate charges of unlawfully intercepting a conference call between an FBI official and a member of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and subsequently posting the call on YouTube. O&rsquo;Cearrbhail has declined to comment further to <em>University Times</em> reporters on the proceedings thus far.\r\n\r\nThe pair were initially arrested in 2012 as part of a worldwide investigation into the hacking group Anonymous and its sister-group Lulzsec. Five other men in the United States and United Kingdom were also arrested on suspicion of working on behalf of Lulzsec. Its leader Hector Xavier Monsegur was arrested in September 2011 and is said to have aided the FBI in accumulating enough incriminating evidence against his fellow hackers to warrant arrests.\r\nThe two Irishmen are set to go on trial in October, giving them time to collect &euro;5,000 each to pay for the damage caused to the website. If tried at district court level the men could face a fine and up to a year in prison.\r\n\r\nThe solicitors for both students have reaffirmed that neither of the men have any previous convictions. Judge Ryan has called for a Probation Service to carry out a restorative justice report on the hackers; if the report returns positive and the &euro;10,000 is repaid, the pair may be saved from sentencing and see their criminal records spared.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/anon.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "16842", "Heading": "Irish Student &ldquo;Hacktivists&rdquo; Admit to Defacing Fine Gael Website"}
