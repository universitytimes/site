{"Body": "<p>Sir &ndash; As the new hockey season begins, I would like to draw attention to some of the problems that Trinity Hockey Club faces.</p>\n<p>Despite the great amount work and money put into improving the hockey pitch last year, which was much appreciated, it was more of a temporary patchwork job then a long term solution.&nbsp; Unfortunately the hockey clubs are still faced with the problem that the grounds in Santry are simply no longer up to standard.</p>\n<p>As the pace of the game is increasing and becoming much more three dimensional, the Trinity pitch simply does not allow players to develop the skills required of them due to the lack of suspension in the surface.</p>\n<p>There is also the issue of the increased risk of injury as players are more prone to problems such as shin splints when playing on such a hard surface.</p>\n<p>The game has developed from being played on grass pitches to grit, and in turn from grit to sand based.&nbsp; Now the move is from sand based to water based and there is a great danger that Trinity will be left behind if we do not embrace this development.</p>\n<p>As a club we are playing at an extremely competitive level, with the first XI playing in Division 1 of the Leinster league.&nbsp; We are at an extreme disadvantage as a result of the pitches we are required to play on as we compete with teams such as Pembroke and UCD who have top quality grounds which allow players to maximise their potential.</p>\n<p>It is essential that our pitches are replaced and that arrangements are made in the meantime to allow the club access to a pitch of a high quality if it is to have any chance of maintaining its success in the future.&nbsp; As things stand, many potential players are turned off joining the hockey club because of the nature of the facilities Trinity has to offer.</p>\n<p>In addition to the pitch, the general facilities in Santry are also in serious need of attention.&nbsp; There are no dugouts for the teams.&nbsp; There is nowhere to take the visiting teams for refreshments after matches, which is particularly embarrassing if they have traveled long distances to play us.&nbsp; Nobody (neither Trinity nor visiting teams) will use the shower facilities because of their condition.</p>\n<p>This is just a brief insight into some of the areas that need improvement.&nbsp; Visiting teams frequently complain about our hockey facilities in general, or lack thereof, and there is a stigma attached to coming to play in Santry as a result.
