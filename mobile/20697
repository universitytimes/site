{"Body": "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">College can be a time of immense upheaval, change and unprecedented stress for many students.\u00a0Stress can be caused by the new responsibility to juggle finances as well as increased alcohol consumption, poor\u00a0eating habits and lack of physical exercise. The structure of self-directed learning entrusts the\u00a0college student with the responsibility to attend, keep up, and submit. And not to mention conduct a decent social\u00a0life simultaneously - an unrealistic motto for most. This build up of stress can impact negatively on your mental well-being but can be combated through regular exercise. So, even if the gym is a foreign station somewhere past the\u00a0Hamilton to you and the idea of you running induces rigors, it's time to put away that fear and introduce some exercise into your life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, three times a week can be attributed to\u00a0increasing self-esteem and lowering levels of negative mood, increasing our metabolic levels of\u00a0energy and stamina, improving mental alertness and cognitive function, not to mention the\u00a0favourable outcome on the immune system, improved fitness levels and weight reduction. Win-win\u00a0situation. Exercise affects the brain, lowering the feelings of anxiety. When we run, there is an\u00a0induced increase in the blood circulation to the brain that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal\u00a0(HPA) axis. This biological influence is thought to be mediated by the collaboration of the HPA axis\u00a0with the areas of the brain that control mood and motivation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Realism is key however. If your\u00a0previous repertoire of exercise involved walking to the fridge or shuffling between pubs, don&rsquo;t push\u00a0yourself too far too quickly. Increase your fitness levels steadily. Doing a two-hour stint on a\u00a0treadmill once a month will leave you physically exhausted, aching, and associating exercise with\u00a0tempting heart attacks. Even worse, your confidence levels will plummet following an unrealistic\u00a0work-out that your body is unaccustomed to. Extreme and intense exercise for the average couch\u00a0potato can prove detrimental. For those starting out on the exercise trail, splitting your work out can\u00a0be just as effective. As opposed to a gruelling half hour, three ten minute bouts will do the job just\u00a0as well.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Exercise is responsible for producing a narcotic effect in the body. Yes, narcotic. Endorphins\u00a0are the narcotic neurotransmitters released in our bodies during exercise. Established as &ldquo;feel good\u00a0chemicals&rdquo;, they work in the central nervous system by prompting and supressing neuronal\u00a0signalling. A stimulus such as food, sex or pain (or all three at once-whatever you&rsquo;re into) causes\u00a0endorphin release. They block pain signal transmission, inducing a &lsquo;high&rsquo; or euphoric feeling by\u00a0locking with opioid \u00a0receptors. Opiate drugs such as morphine and heroin are synthetically designed\u00a0to imitate such a response. Endorphins elicit an organic pain killer and give us a sense of accomplishment, by working with the body&rsquo;s reward pathway. Sprinting, spicy food and orgasms are\u00a0characterised by the endorphin release and general sense of being on top of the world... Even just for\u00a0a few seconds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If your\u00a0previous repertoire of exercise involved walking to the fridge or shuffling between pubs, don&rsquo;t push\u00a0yourself too far too quickly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If exercise isn't your thing then relaxation techniques might be what you're looking for. These less strenuous exercises could help to lower heart rate and blood pressure, as well as control\u00a0frustration. We can gain confidence by remaining calm and controlled in stressful or difficult\u00a0situations. If you&rsquo;re prone to agitation and anger, meditation might be for you. However, an\u00a0energising and stimulating exercise might be more suitable for those prone to becoming withdrawn\u00a0in times of stress.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">All relaxation practice requires a quiet setting, a point of focus, good posture, comfortable\u00a0clothing, and a non-critical and positive mental attitude. If you&rsquo;re cynical about sitting like a lotus\u00a0flower on a yoga mat before you&rsquo;ve even begun, don&rsquo;t expect good results. Autogenic relaxation\u00a0involves body awareness, controlled breathing, reduction in muscle tension and creating a sort\u00a0of inner Zen. You should become aware of your surroundings and of all physical sensations.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Visualisation is the powerful practice of forming mental images to achieve a desired outcome.\u00a0Whether you&rsquo;re imagining yourself content on a serene beach or running a marathon, belief in the\u00a0reality of the thought is essential. Self-belief is also required. You need to incorporate all five senses\u00a0to create a realistic and vivid place in your mind.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Many successful people have used visualisation to\u00a0relax and achieve their goals. Tiger Woods visualised where he would control his golf ball to stop\u00a0on the course, whereas Will Smith visualised his actual success. Exercises such as yoga, pilates and\u00a0tai chi have been proven to improve stamina, strength, concentration and relieve stress. These\u00a0practices also aid flexibility and condition the body. Relaxation is integral to stress management. The\u00a0ability to switch off from the daily pressures of college life is achievable and desirable. The method\u00a0by which you choose to relax is entirely up to you.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/exercise-a-z-comp.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20697", "Heading": "Healthy Body, Healthy Mind."}
