And what&rsquo;s more, what really gets me is I remember ridiculing Glee. Glee was no better than a piece of flattened gum on the sole of my shoe but what&rsquo;s worse, that gum has been impossible to peal and now Glee is an intrinsic part of my daily existence.

A perfect fusion of all that has come to be derided in stereotype, teen-TV, the show follows an after school show choir (or glee club) called &ldquo;New Directions!&rdquo; and is a back-to-basics approach to teen drama that plays to its own conformity by drawing on the age-old recipe of old-school teen movies.

Come the millennium it was a case that while we still hadn&rsquo;t built cars that fly or taken family vacations to the moon, we could at least shake up our programming. So, hand-led into the new decade by our friends Sebastian, Catherine and whatever Reese Witherspoon&rsquo;s name was in Cruel Intentions, TV focused on breaking the derided mould made popular by Saved by the Bell, instead favouring pseudo-sophisticated teen shows that plugged at the idea of a more intelligent viewer.

The seeds were sown for something different, something that reverted back to the age-old stereotype but manipulated it in a way that it wasn&rsquo;t merely a copy of what had come before it: the answer was Glee.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong now, Glee is such a stereotype, from the quiet Asian girl to the girl fabulous gay boy, to the Beyonce-esque diva and the nasal voiced nerd in a wheelchair, there is essentially nothing that separates Glee from its identical siblings before it.
