The bill was amended by Sinn F\u00e9in and accepted by the house.\n\n<strong>21:18</strong> some students about to be removed/angrily asked to take a seat for standing in gallery.\n\n<strong>21:11</strong> No phones allowed. Result will be tweeted and updates where possible. Chamber half-full now for debate and vote.\n\n<strong>21:08</strong> TDs have been called to vote. Worth pointing out that government has not lost such a vote since the Haughey years.\n\n<strong>21:07</strong> Kevin Humphreys tweets that he told SU President Rory Dunne earlier today that he would miss the public meeting.\n\n<strong>21:05</strong> Not many present at all for the debate and vote. More in gallery than in chamber.\n\n<strong>21:04</strong> Fianna F\u00e1il spokesperson calls out 'ineptitude' of government over grants debacle.\n\n<strong>20:58</strong> We're moving towards the gallery.\n\n<strong>20:55</strong> The 85-strong crowd has been signed in to the D\u00e1il by members of the opposition. Earlier, @fiannafailparty tweeted that they would be proposing a motion to ask government TDs to 'keep their promise'.\n\nAt the pre-budget match in 2011, Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin told UT News Editor Jack Leahy that Labour could not 'make heartfelt promises to students... [that they] didn't have to'.\n\n<em>20:51</em> 80 students have just descended on the D\u00e1il.\n\n<strong>20:45</strong> Room has disbanded to observe vote at Leinster House.\n\n<strong>20:45</strong> It must be said that Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 Riord\u00e1in's response to Logue's rebuttal was to storm out.\n\n<strong>20:43</strong> Fine Gael Councillor says access is a 'success story' in Ireland.\n\n<strong>20:42</strong> Speaker recommends 'shafting' Labour TDs in subsequent elections. Room disbands to Leinster House.\n\n<strong>20:36</strong> Aodhan \u00d3 Riord\u00e1in TD speaks quite frankly and says he prioritises primary and secondary education for his disadvantaged constituents. Logue accuses him of falsely pitting people against each other like 'every other Labour politician'.\n\n<strong>20:34</strong> All attendees have been signed in to the D\u00e1il for the private members' vote.\n\n<strong>20:32</strong> Rousing speech from Logue. 'We're great at complaining in the pub - ask us to protest and we're not so hot. It's time to change that.'\n\n'Students have to go to the welfare officer for food - what the hell kind of world is this?'\n\n<strong>20:31</strong>\n<blockquote>The same Minister who promised not to increase fees wants to increase fees to &euro;3,000. He wants to effect the biggest increase in the history of the state.</blockquote>\n<strong>20:30</strong> USI President John Logue is now speaking as Dublin North Central TD Aodhan \u00d3 Riord\u00e1in points impatiently to his watch.\n\n<strong>20:25</strong>\n<blockquote>If this government doesn't care about education, what's the impetus to stay here? What affinity do we have with this country?</blockquote>\n\n- Keogan.\n\n\n<strong>20:23</strong> Keogan points out that for every &euro;250 extra students have to pay, that's &euro;250 less from the government so there's no improvement in quality.\n\n<strong>20:19</strong> David Keogan of DITSU warmly welcomed. He's speaking of the difficulties faced by even those students who have received their grant. Says student assistance fund is 'inundated' but there is no commitment to maintain the fund beyond this year.\n\n\n<blockquote>Maybe Minister Quinn thinks &euro;250 isn't that much... He's wrong. This is crisis stage. He doesn't realise how bad things are on the ground.</blockquote>\n\nDavid echoes Rory's anecdotes about welfare services being in high demand.\n\n\n<strong>20:17</strong> Aaron McGee of NCISU says this year is by far the worst he has seen for student welfare. He claims that twice as many welfare loans as were given out by his union last year have already been given out this year.\n\n<strong>20:15</strong>\n<blockquote>If the deputy thinks we aren't worth hearing, he's mistaken. He'll hear us on Twitter, by email, at the march, and in person. </blockquote>\n<strong>20:14</strong> Dunne says he would like to see Minister Quinn stay 'consistent' and break his pledge to up the registration fee to &euro;3,000.\n\n<strong>20:12</strong> Rory Dunne, TCDSU president, is up now.\n\n<blockquote> We were so close to perfection in higher education. &euro;250 at a time, Ruair\u00ed Quinn is throwing it all away.</blockquote>\n\nRory strikes an emotional note by telling of the number of students who pass his office to reach the welfare office.\n\n<strong>20:06</strong> The JCR halls committee have arrived. In a rather unprecedented move, they have chosen to involve themselves in a political campaign.\n\n<strong>19:56</strong> John Logue, Cat O'Driscoll, Kate Acheson and Michael Thompson from USI have arrived and are setting up.\n\n<strong>19:52</strong> TCDSU welfare officer Aisling N\u00ed Chonaire on Twitter:\n\n<blockquote>@KHumphreysTD could you not drop over in between speech and vote? #noexcuse</blockquote>\n\nAisling has a point - we're five minutes away.\n\n<strong>19:51</strong> The room is slowly filling up now with representatives of all three Colleges.\n\n<strong>19:45</strong> Kevin Humphreys, the TD at the centre of this campaign, has just tweeted at UT to say he <em>won't</em> be attending the meeting. He'll be attending a D\u00e1il session instead.\n\n<strong>17:23 </strong>The meeting begins at 8pm in the Alexander Hotel on Fenian Street. Representatives of TCDSU and USI will be in attendance, as well as members of the DIT and National College of Ireland SU executives.\n\nThe meeting is a call-to-arms to engage with USI's 'Fed Up, Stand Up' campaign. Kevin Humphreys TD, TCDSU's target for lobbying, has been invited and the event will be followed by a private members bill in the D\u00e1il on third-level funding at 9pm.\n\n<em>Follow the debate on Twitter - <a href=\"twitter.com/universitytimes\">@universitytimes</a> or #StandUp</em>", "Imageurl": "13341", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13340", "Heading": "LIVE: Public Meeting on Cost of Education"}
