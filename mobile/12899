After a disappointing loss to St.Pat&rsquo;s last week the girls got their league campaign in full swing with a 2-9 to 1-11 victory. The conditions in Parnell&rsquo;s were perfect for both teams. The team got off to a great start scoring four points in quick succession to stamp their dominating intentions on the game, for an early, and well deserved lead. The best of the scores came from new addition, Sarah Cunneen, who tore through the DCU defence to deliver the ball to Louise Hogan. Hogan, another new player, slotted it over the bar.\n\nDCU replied to the early onslaught with a goal quickly followed by a point to bring the game level. A hard fought battle in the middle of the pitch was to become a dominant feature of the game with Trinity&rsquo;s Sarah Cotter and Ciara Kelly edging the competition. In defence, Jackie Elbert was as solid as a rock leaving the talented DCU forwards little opportunity to add to their tally. The rest of the first half continued on with an exchange of points until Trinity broke the mould with a goal from talented new PhD student Emma O&rsquo;Connor. Trinity were 1-6 to 1-4 up at half time.\n\nThe second half started much the same for Trinity with Mairi Ni Mhuineachain adding a series of stunning strikes to further add to Trinity&rsquo;s dominance of the game. DCU struggled to keep up with the Trinity forward line and the introduction of Aoife Dooley further added to their woes. The midfield battle intensified with DCU half forward line beginning to find their feet and cause the Trinity back line headaches, adding to their points tally but still not able to penetrate the goal of Emma Gillen.\n\nThroughout the second half, the home side never looked likely to surrender their hard earned lead and stayed strong until the end. They only succumbed to a late DCU flourish, which was academic by that point.\u00a0 The scoreline was a respectable 2-9 to 1-11 when the final whistle blew.", "Imageurl": "12901", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12899", "Heading": "Camogie Team Claim First Win of Campaign"}
