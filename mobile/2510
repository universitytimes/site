{"Body": "Aoife Considine-\n\nSo we&rsquo;re finally seeing a bit of sun in our fair city and as a result, the green in front of the Arts Block has become swarmed with the numerous ABKs taking breaks from the library or whatever else it is they do with their time, I dunno, maybe having coffee or something. In fairness though, I must admit that the throngs of colourful, well-dressed folk around the Book of Kells is a pleasant change from the usual uniformed youths and Spanish students that typically inhabit this area. The sun also means that people have begun shedding the layers; winter coats are being left at home and all of a sudden that girl you never even noticed has emerged from under her box-shaped green parka she&rsquo;d been donning all winter to reveal an unreal body paired with killer legs. Oh yes folks, creeping season has officially begun.\n\nEven down the Hamilton end the corridors are less crowded as people have begun migrating towards the cricket pitch and are even skipping Maths lectures to do so- heaven forbid. There&rsquo;s a real buzz about Trinity when the sun comes out, people are smiling and seem more attractive and boys are starting to spend their afternoons playing tip on the rugby pitch, which I for one fully support.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum however, exams are looming and so the library has become a haven for the majority of us. Even now as I write this in the Hamilton library, seats are few and far between at half three on a Wednesday afternoon. Have we all gotten the fear? Maybe I should probably start actually doing some proper work and not spend library time writing street style articles that have no relevance to my course? Maybe the exams really are looming faster than I think? Then again, due to this sudden influx in library attendance, there&rsquo;s a lot more talent about. Yeah, maybe I&rsquo;ll start &ldquo;studying&rdquo; here more often.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong> </strong><strong>Arts Block</strong>:\n\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/magnus-street-style-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2511\" style=\"border: 3px solid red;\" title=\"magnus street style 4\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/magnus-street-style-4-626x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"477\" height=\"717\" />\n</a>\nName: </strong>Magnus Williams\n\n<strong>Course: </strong>PPES SF (courses always sound better abbreviated)\n\n<strong>Who/What influences your style?</strong>\n\nGok Won\n\n<strong>What&rsquo;s your favourite Dublin store to shop in?</strong>\n\nTopman\n\n<strong>What&rsquo;s your best fashion investment?</strong>\n\nMy first pair of glasses\n\n<strong>If you could have any celebrity&rsquo;s wardrobe who would it be?</strong>\n\nApart from Gok Wan- probably Gok Wan&hellip;\n\n<strong>What&rsquo;s the most expensive fashion item you&rsquo;ve ever bought?</strong>\n\nMy first pair of glasses\n\n<strong>Do you feel there&rsquo;s pressure to dress well in Trinity?</strong>\n\nNot particularly no\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Sin\u00e9ad-Mercier-style-4.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-2512\" style=\"border: 3px solid red;\" title=\"Sin\u00e9ad Mercier style 4\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Sin\u00e9ad-Mercier-style-4-608x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"477\" height=\"717\" />\n</a>\nName: </strong>Sin\u00e9ad Mercier\n\n<strong>Course: </strong>Law 3<sup>rd</sup> year\n\n<strong>Who/What influences your style? </strong>\n\nPoverty\n\n<strong>What&rsquo;s your favourite Dublin store to shop in?</strong>\n\nSecond hand shops mainly\n\n<strong>What&rsquo;s your best fashion investment?</strong>\n\nA pair of Marc Jacobs shoes that I got about five years ago and I wear them all the time.\n\n<strong>If you could have any celebrity&rsquo;s wardrobe who would it be?</strong>\n\nVivienne Westwood\n\n<strong>What&rsquo;s the most expensive fashion item you&rsquo;ve ever bought?</strong>\n\nProbably my debs dress from Karen Millen!
