Both sides have plenty of talent and experience; DIT has two Superleague players, Trinity has four, and so the match promised to be a tough one. Determined to get the all-important win, Trinity hit the ground running and got off to a great start. With each team going basket-for-basket it seemed that neither team could get the upper hand but Trinity held out and ended the first quarter with a 12-8 lead thanks to some fast-breaks.\n\nEven with losing a few key players from last year&rsquo;s squad, DIT proved to be a formidable opposition and made life difficult with a strong inside presence. Despite this though, they found it difficult to defend Trinity&rsquo;s offensive play as it picked apart their zone defence with open outside shots and good inside looks. While DIT fought back with two three-pointers in quick succession they were left trailing 24-15 at the half.\n\nTrinity, not leaving anything to chance, blew DIT completely out of the water in the third quarter withholding them to only one basket for the entire quarter. This super defence led to steals and great fast break opportunities. The increased intensity also resulted in the majority of attempts being converted with the misses being impressively rebounded for put backs. DIT had no answer to this excellent performance and the surge saw Trinity increase their lead by a whopping 33 points. The lead allowed Trinity to hone their offensive play and practice various options off it which will prove invaluable in upcoming games.\n\nThe final quarter saw no change in Trinity&rsquo;s defence but the DIT defense also stepped up a notch. But the advantage was too great and the final few points seemed like it was too little too late. The impressive lead was held by Trinity with a final score of 60-22. Trinity will be determined now to continue their winning form in forthcoming games.", "Imageurl": "<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=6742\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-6742\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6742\" title=\"bball\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/155214_10150100477991002_592846001_7737816_4254351_n.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></a></strong></span>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Trinity 66-22 DIT</strong></span>\n<strong>Rebecca O'Keeffe</strong>\n<em>Staff Writer; @OKeeffe_R</em>\n\nFresh from a narrow defeat to Maynooth,<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.380820090939.166910.162570135939&amp;type=3#!/pages/Trinity-Basketball/162570135939\"> Trinity ladies&rsquo; basketball team </a>faced DIT in their third league match of the season.
