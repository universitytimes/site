{"Body": "<strong>\n</strong>\n\nThe following statement from the TCD Students' Union on the revision of Graduate Students' Union funding was sent to <em>The University Times </em>today:\n<blockquote>In advance of next academic year, the funding of the GSU was reviewed after a request was made to the Capatition Committee by the GSU. This involved the GSU applying for extra funding, more permanent financial arrangements, and identifying considerable savings on previous expenditure.\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\n</span>The restructuring of GSU funding involved a permanent increase in their allocation of &euro;10,000 that would lead to a balanced budget for the next number of years. The meeting discussed a template expenditure based on previous accounts to convince the voting members that the arrangement was suitable, with a unanimous vote of GSU, SU, CSC, DUCAC and Publications representatvies voting in favour.</div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\n</span>It was important that such a decision be made this in this academic year as the arrangement for extra funding injected by the SU was coming to an end. 3 years ago there was a concern that the GSU would not be able to afford paying its second sabbatical officer. At the time negoations took place between the SU and GSU after which then SU President, Conan O'Brien decided that the GSU required assistance in balancing their budget. Recognising the benefit to students from the provision of specific postgraduate services, representatives attempted to identify a way that the Students' Union could help secure these services. Investigations showed that it would be sustainable for 3 years for the SU to draw &euro;15,000 from it's reserves to assist the GSU in its time of need. In addition considerable administrative procedures were merged with the Students' Union to relieve the pressure on the GSU.</div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\n</span>We are pleased to announce that during this time the GSU was able to sustain its activities and had the ability to restructure its expenditure with the confidence of knowing that it would be finacically secure for the next year.</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">\n</span>From the academic year 2012/13 greater financial security will be provided through the sustainable funding directly from capitations. The &euro;10,000 increase in capitated funding, coupled with the identification of &euro;12,150 worth of savings on current practice, provides a permanent base from which the GSU can launch its operations, free from the uncertainty of short term arrangements. In particular, we are delighted that this arrangement secures the ability to retain a second full time sabbatical officer with the portfolio of Postgraduate Education and Welfare, a vital resource for the postgraduate body. We also hope to continue to increase our successful collabration on many issues in particular in the use of the students union front office facilities to assist GSU officers.\nAt this point we would like to congratulate the recent GSU executive committees on coming through this period of transition and establishing a secure financial and organisational plan for the future.</div>\n<div>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBest wishes,\n<div>\n\nStudents' Union Sabbatical Officers\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></blockquote>", "Imageurl": "8467", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8450", "Heading": "SU's statement on revision of GSU funding"}
