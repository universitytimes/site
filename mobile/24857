{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Clare Droney</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"> | Senior Staff Writer</span></p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Student campaigners have successfully called for a referendum to be held later this month regarding the Students&rsquo; Union&rsquo;s position on the system of &lsquo;direct provision&rsquo; for asylum seekers in Ireland. This will be the seventh referendum called in the current academic year, making this college year the highest on record for referenda held by the Students&rsquo; Union.</span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sources have also indicated that the Union will receive signatures this week calling for an eighth referendum, requesting that the Union adopt of a policy of boycotting Israeli produce and campaign for international sanctions on Israel.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The vast majority of students in Trinity are opposed to direct provision once they understand what it is.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">History and Political Science student, Peter Gowan, one of the leading figures behind the asylum seekers referendum, is confident of support from student voters. Gowan highlighted the extremely positive response the campaigners received on campus as they collected the 250 signatures necessary to put forward this referendum to the Students&rsquo; Union. &ldquo;I had scheduled out three days of collections for the signatures. In the end we didn&rsquo;t need three days, we needed three hours.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The vast majority of students in Trinity are opposed to direct provision once they understand what it is,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The wording of the referendum will ask students: &ldquo;Do you support including the following in TCDSU&rsquo;s long term-policy?: TCDSU shall campaign: 1. To abolish the system of direct provision for asylum seekers; 2. For its replacement by self-catered accommodation and the right to work for asylum seekers who have not had their applications processed after six months; 3. For the government to sign up to the EU Receptions Conditions Directive setting down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"There are black-spots like this on our human rights record which I think really need to be corrected.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gowan roundly condemns the realities of direct provision for asylum seekers in Ireland and considers the system one of the most significant &ldquo;black-spots&rdquo; on the country&rsquo;s human rights record. &ldquo;We like to think of ourselves as a tolerant, liberal and multicultural society but there are black-spots like this on our human rights record which I think really need to be corrected,&rdquo; Gowan told <em>The University Times</em> this week.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The system of &lsquo;Direct Provision&rsquo; was introduced by the Irish government in 2000 as a response to an influx of asylum applications and the corresponding increase in demand for asylum-seeker accommodation in the late 1990s. However, the system has increasingly come under criticism from national bodies such as the Irish Refugee Council. Under Direct Provision, asylum seekers are housed by the government&rsquo;s Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) in residential centres across the country while their application for refugee status is being processed. The residents at these centres are provided with three meals a day at set times, a medical card and other basic services and receive a weekly stipend of &euro;19.10 per adult and &euro;9.60 per child.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">The Irish Refugee Council, the country&rsquo;s only national non-governmental organisation which specialises in working with and for refugees in Ireland, have highlighted concerns such as overcrowding, restrictions on family life, social exclusion, diet and lack of independence for asylum seekers and their families at these residential centres.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These children &ldquo;grow up in an environment where their parents are totally dependent on the state.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gowan, who is leading the campaign to end direct provision in Trinity, also vocalises concerns about the situation for children who make up more than one-third of the people living under direct provision in Ireland. Gowan comments that these children &ldquo;grow up in an environment where their parents are totally dependent on the state.&rdquo; As a result he believes that they find it difficult to later integrate into Irish communities and live independent lives.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A particularly contentious issue for the campaigners in Trinity and the Irish Refugee Council is the stipulation that asylum seekers are banned from working while living in direct provision residential centres awaiting their applications to be processed. The student campaign in Trinity advocates the alternative model to direct provision advocated by the Irish Refugee Council which supports self-catered accommodation for asylum seekers and the right to work if their applications have not been processed after six months. The campaigners are lobbying for the government to sign up to the EU Receptions Conditions Directive setting down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Overall, Gowan welcomes the &ldquo;level of interest and engagement with the issues so far&rdquo; and is &ldquo;looking forward to the campaign so we can inform more people about this important issue.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"We'll have to run a very effective information campaign to get people to the ballot.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The referendum to end direct provision will be held alongside another referendum this month. On the expected level of voter turnout, SU Education Officer Jack Leahy commented &ldquo;we typically see increased turnout when a referendum vote is held alongside either class rep elections or sabbatical officer elections. In the absence of either of those crowd-drawing plebiscites, we'll have to run a very effective information campaign to get people to the ballot.&rdquo; He remains confident regarding voter turn-out and added, &ldquo;I'm looking forward to the challenge.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the context of the &ldquo;unprecedented&rdquo; number of referenda put to Trinity students this academic year, Leahy stated that this is &ldquo;a clear indication that students are confident in their Union&rsquo;s capacity both to represent them on issues and to affect positive change within the organisation itself.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The referendum will be held at the same time as a vote on the adoption of a new constitution, as well as the potential eighth referendum, on Wednesday 19th and Thursday 20th March.</p>\r\nPast referenda held this academic year concerned the reform of the Seanad; marriage equality; the proposed impeachment of the SU President; the Tobacco-Free Trinity initiative; and gender identity and expression. A preferendum was also held on abortion rights during the SU elections.\r\n\r\n<em>Photo by the Irish Refugee Council</em>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/direct-provision.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24857", "Heading": "Trinity Students to Vote on Direct Provision in Seventh Referendum Called This Year"}
