{"Body": "&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Jack Leahy &amp; Hannah Ryan</strong>\u00a0| News Editor &amp; Senior Staff Writer\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of the Central Societies Committee has been called for the 12th December, at which the college Science-Fiction society will move to revoke the decision to relocate them from their room in House 6 to a shared space in Goldsmith Hall. Sci-Fi managed to collect signatures from one sixth of all society treasurers to force the meeting. Society treasurers constitute the CSC committee and have the constitutional power to overturn a decision made by the executive.\n\nThe University Times has also learned of a meeting that took place late last week between the society and a number of influential College administrators. At this meeting, significant concerns were expressed as to the potential wider impact of the executive&rsquo;s decision.\n\nThe controversial decision to relocate the society was made at a meeting of the CSC executive on November 14th, the official reason being that the society is not making full use of the popular room 6.31, and that they cannot be justified in having sole use of the space. It was proposed that Sci-Fi be moved to Arch 6 in Goldsmith Hall, shared with DU Gamers&rsquo; Soc - a suggestion that provoked outrage from members of both societies.\n\nHowever, the CSC&rsquo;s constitution allows that &lsquo;Decisions of the Executive may be reversed by a simple majority of those present, eligible to vote&hellip; at a General Meeting of the Committee.&rsquo; Sci-Fi members are hopeful that the resolution to relocate Sci-Fi will be rescinded at the EGM, which will take place this Wednesday at 5pm in the J.M. Synge Theatre.\n\nThe exact motion, as included on the agenda of the meeting, is &lsquo;that the decision made by the CSC Executive at its meeting of November 14th 2012 to move the Science Fiction Society from Room 6.31 to Arch 6, Goldsmith Hall be revoked.&rsquo; It was proposed by Sam Heavey of the society, and seconded by David Cullinan, Treasurer of the Film Society.\n\nFurthermore, The University Times has learned that a meeting was held on Thursday 6th of December between Sci-Fi Society, Dean of Students Amanda Piesse, and the head of the College Disability Service Declan Treanor. At this meeting, Dr. Piesse, while affirming her neutrality, expressed her concerns as to the transparency involved in the formation of the original decision. Mr. Treanor further questioned the decision on grounds relating to his own area of competency. He expressed his concerns that the Gamers room, if shared with a large and boisterous group, would no longer be a place that his service could recommend for students with autism.\n\nCSC Chairperson Cian McCarthy did not attend the meeting as his email address was apparently copied incorrectly on the follow-up email from the office of the Dean of Students confirming arrangements for the meeting.\n\nSecretary of the CSC, David Doyle, has said that a second motion for the Sci-Fi society &lsquo;to create and submit a proposal for the moving of no fewer than two (2) other societies in to room 31 House 6&rsquo; was also put forward for the agenda but rejected. The motion called for the society itself to &lsquo;create and submit a proposal for the moving proposal for the moving of no fewer than two (2) other societies in to room 31 House 6.&rsquo;\n\nIt was excluded from the schedule on the grounds that it does not comply with the Constitution of the CSC; as section 8.6 of the document states, &lsquo;Any and all motions tabled&hellip; shall not require of the Committee the exercise of powers outside of those Powers stipulated within this Constitution.&rsquo; Doyle said that &lsquo;the excluded submission requires the Science Fiction society act as representative of societies&rsquo;, contrary to section 2.1 of the Constitution, which assigns exclusively to the CSC the primary object of acting as the &lsquo;sole representative within the University of Dublin&rsquo; of all recognised University Societies.\n\nMoreover, &lsquo;the allocation and maintenance of University Society rooms and facilities&rsquo; is listed in the Constitution as the responsibility of the Amenities Officer of the CSC, a position currently held by Laura Greene; thus the Committee in itself does not possess any authority over the movement of societies between rooms.\n\nDoyle further articulated that the rejected motion &lsquo;is predicated upon the false assumption of possession of College space&hellip; The College space which any society that has access to a room uses, is not space given by College to the societies but is College space given over to the CSC to be allocated as the CSC sees fit for the furtherance of the constitutional aims of the CSC. (There are some exceptions in relation to College space; the Phil and the Hist are the most obvious).\n\n&lsquo;The space that Sci-Fi has currently allocated to it is NOT Sci-Fi&rsquo;s space, it is CSC space currently occupied by Sci-Fi at CSC&rsquo;s decision.&rsquo;\n\nDoyle had previously told The University Times that the move is &lsquo;part of a larger movement of all societies. This was the decision that the exec felt was best for societies in general.&rsquo; However, Greene&rsquo;s report for the December 12th EGM describes extensive efforts to ensure that changes in room usage in the Atrium &lsquo;have allowed for the societies&rsquo; needs to be accommodated for, while remaining in their respective rooms.&rsquo;\n\nSam Heavey, Sci-Fi treasurer and the proposer of the motion to revoke the decision, spoke to condemn what he called &lsquo;a lack of responsibility&rsquo; on behalf of the CSC:\n\n&lsquo;Further to our own investigation as to our being moved to the arches, I emailed Karl Flynn, the fire safety officer, of the college. I asked about having bookcases and books in the corridor outside the new room. The bookcases in the corridor were an idea put forward by the CSC when we stated there would be no room to keep all our books. Karl informed me that this was indeed a fire hazard. I emailed again just to be 100%, and he said it wasn't happening.\n\n&lsquo;The decision to move two societies in together was not planned out correctly. They did not check the bookcase situation before moving us, and [the CSC] did not consider the damage it would do to the Gamer society and its members.&rsquo;\n\nSpeaking to The University Times, DU Film Society Treasurer Cullinan offered a statement on behalf of the society. The society affirmed Sci-Fi&rsquo;s presentation of &lsquo;fair and balanced alternatives&rsquo; to the initial decision and the society&rsquo;s contribution to the atmosphere in House 6:\n\n&lsquo;We understand the reasoning of the CSC in this matter, however we supported Sci Fi in their action to revoke the decision out of the belief that, while the use of space in 6.31 needs to be rethought, Sci Fi's total eviction is not necessary to this process and a more mutually beneficial solution could have been reached through consultation and discussion with representatives from the affected societies.\n\n&lsquo;Sci Fi have presented a number of fair and balanced alternatives since the CSC made their decision, which we think could better cater to the existing need for a reallocation of space and which we strongly believe should be entertained before a final course of action is reached.\n\n&lsquo;Sci Fi contributes greatly to the House 6 atmosphere that constitutes a hugely important facet of many people's college experience so, as well as a desire for transparency and fairness in matters such as these, we affirm that their removal from the building would be to the detriment of the whole of House 6, one of college's most active student spaces.&rsquo;", "Imageurl": "&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Jack Leahy &amp; Hannah Ryan</strong>\u00a0| News Editor &amp; Senior Staff Writer\n\nAn Extraordinary General Meeting of the Central Societies Committee has been called for the 12th December, at which the college Science-Fiction society will move to revoke the decision to relocate them from their room in House 6 to a shared space in Goldsmith Hall.
