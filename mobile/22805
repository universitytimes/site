{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sin\u00e9ad Baker</strong> | Deputy Online Editor</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0Niteline, a phone and online listening service ran by students for students in TCD, UCD, DCU, RCSI, NCAD and Maynooth, is trialling a new &lsquo;public faces&rsquo; campaign which aims to both increase both their publicity and connect more students with the service.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0I sat down with Hannah Jean Ryan, Niteline&rsquo;s coordinator, to discuss the changes taking place in the organisation. Niteline runs a strict policy of anonymity; their posters claim, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t know who you are&rdquo;, and their volunteers are trained to keep their involvement with the organisation secret. Hannah emphasised that although it seems they face a dilemma by launching this new campaign, as &ldquo;anonymity is so fundamental to who we are&rdquo;, she stressed that their policy of confidentiality and anonymity will never be compromised. &ldquo;Anonymity has been one of our four cornerstones since the beginning. It&rsquo;s important for students to be really confident that we take this policy seriously, especially as a student organisation. Those policies have to be respected.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">As a result of their training many volunteers would not have felt comfortable being a public face without coming off the phones</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0The new campaign will see Hannah and the current Regional Representative (formerly a trainer and Coordinator) Aaron Watson become the current &lsquo;faces&rsquo; of Niteline; their experiences of working with and their knowledge of the organisation were cited as the reasons they were chosen to act as its spokespeople. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no longer in college anymore, and I&rsquo;m no longer on the phones, so for me it makes sense&rdquo;, clarified Hannah, highlighting how as a result of their training many volunteers would not have felt comfortable being a public face without coming off the phones, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the heart of our service&rdquo;. The new campaign follows the success of Nitelines in the UK with similar campaigns. &ldquo;It means we can put a voice on the organisation, and speak at public events and to the media&rdquo; she explained, citing previous frustrations at having to use volunteers from the Students&rsquo; Union or peer mentors rather than their own volunteers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had our people out in morph suits before, to remind people that we&rsquo;re here, but some people did find it creepy. We believe really strongly about what we do and we want to be able to talk about it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Niteline is currently unable to release many figures regarding callers, and often have to rely on feedback from Welfare Officers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve tried to stay creative, but we can&rsquo;t go much further without this step,&rdquo; Hannah explained, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard to publicise with such strict anonymity. It&rsquo;s an enormous challenge to humanise the service and to connect with students. We want to improve transparency so people can engage with us&rdquo;. The step would also allow them to speak publicly about welfare from a student perspective, an area they believe they are uniquely qualified to speak about, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re open 9pm until 2.30am, when the services offered by the Welfare Officer and Counselling Service are closed.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">Anonymity will always remain at the heart of the service</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I asked Hannah about the future for Niteline if this trial campaign is successful, and she stressed that anonymity will always remain at the heart of the service. &ldquo;In some Nitelines all of Exec are public, but it just couldn&rsquo;t work that way here. The College community is not that big, even if a student tells their housemate they work for Niteline it might make them reluctant to call. We have to be mindful of the different cultures&rdquo;. The success of their instant messaging service, which has &ldquo;taken off enormously&rdquo;, has been partly attributed to the extra level of anonymity that it provides; no one can recognise your voice, and you cannot be overheard. The organisation is committed to continuing to value this commitment to anonymity and confidentiality; she admits &ldquo;it might be hard to create a presence with only two people, but the &lsquo;public faces&rsquo; campaign will never extend to all of our volunteers&rdquo;. She clarified that it may one day expand to a core group of five or ten volunteers yet maintained, &ldquo;we have a long way to go before that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The organisation is currently working on releasing a statistics package of those statistics which they can release legally, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re receiving more calls than ever, and we need more facilities&rdquo; Hannah added.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">\"For us volunteer support is number one, they give up their sleep and we have to make sure they&rsquo;re safe&rdquo;</blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">Niteline trains their volunteers through a group of four trainers that are elected by Exec, &ldquo;They are experienced volunteers, and training is on-going&rdquo;. The system is based off the success of many Nitelines in the UK, and Hannah is keen to emphasise the support network in place for volunteers, &ldquo;we have a mandatory support meeting every two weeks for all volunteers, we&rsquo;re very strict and they can only talk about their emotions but there&rsquo;s a massive support culture. For us volunteer support is number one, they give up their sleep and we have to make sure they&rsquo;re safe.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Niteline commits itself to the principles of &ldquo;non-directive listening&rdquo;, listening &ldquo;carefully and with attention&rdquo; without offering professional advice unless asked for information. The service provides an unbiased and impartial space for students to &ldquo;explore their problems&rdquo; and to receive support and information from a unique student perspective. They urge any students with issues to get in touch with the service, and for anyone with questions to contact info@niteline.org</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/unnamed-1.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22805", "Heading": "Niteline's 'Public Faces' Campaign"}
