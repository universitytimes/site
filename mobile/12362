Not because you get to be a cog in the deadening cycle of lectures, library and academia for four years. No, it&rsquo;s wonderful because you get to meet kick-ass celebrities, which you otherwise would never get anywhere near. This year a horde of famous people are coming to Trinity to be honoured with the opportunity of addressing Ireland&rsquo;s best and brightest, or at least that&rsquo;s what they were told by the society head who invited them. Rather, they&rsquo;ll talk for a bit, receive a medal of some sort and you&rsquo;ll be wowed in your seat because you&rsquo;re sitting in front of your childhood hero. Seriously, you&rsquo;d be crazy not to catch some of the cool names listed below. Make a note of your favourites, go to the event, ask a the guest a question, enjoy a popular facebook status about the experience, and then return to your dreary degree until the next hotshot celeb drops by.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>The Phil</strong>\n\nIf it&rsquo;s celebrity schmoozing you&rsquo;re after then look no further than the Phil.
