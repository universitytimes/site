{"Body": "Riccardo Savona\n\nPizza, Pasta and Mafia: these appear to be three of the most famous, stereotypical &ldquo;symbols&rdquo; of Italians. Now if the first and second are products of which we are overwhelmingly proud, and the fight against the third is something that remains frequently uncovered by foreign media, a more complex situation arises with the (in)famous political leader the country is renowned for: Silvio Berlusconi. Whether commenting on Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;tan&rdquo; or making the German chancellor Merkel wait because of a phone call, you can be sure that if at a meeting between world leaders something embarrassing happens, Berlusconi will be involved in it. But it is not about these farcical episodes that I want to write, as I believe that his actions speak louder than anyone&rsquo;s words. What I want to talk about instead is what is left out from the stories depicted by foreign media.\n\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong> </strong>\n<strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1980\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Berlusconi: Man of the people?\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/berlusconi.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1980 \" title=\"berlusconi\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/berlusconi-300x228.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"228\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n</strong>\n\nThis is not to say that all the criticism made in the past few weeks by leading newspapers is all spurious, however, it just doesn't cover everything. It would seem crazy to most people that such a man would play a fundamental role in the politics of an important country, yet it is important to remember that <em>every</em> country has its own charlatans, buffoons and jesters, each with their own skeletons in the closet (or in this case a bunch of beautiful and floozy ladies). So how was such a man able to gain the approval of 67% at an opinion poll during the elections of 2008? And what is also more interesting how can he still rely after all that has happened recently on a rate of approval of 36%?\n\nI have often asked myself these questions and I think that a very good analysis was given by an Italian journalist Beppe Severgnini in his book:\u00a0<em>Berlusconi Explained to Posterity and our Friends Abroad</em>. First according to him, there is the human factor, as Berlusconi gives the image of being a typical Italian person, he &ldquo;adores his kids, talks about his mamma, knows his football, makes money, loves new homes, hates rules, tells jokes, swears a bit, adores women and likes to party&rdquo;. Secondly, he is a champion of the so called &ldquo;Italian resourcefulness and individualism&rdquo; as a successful businessman; a mentality he also supports in his political life. And third of all, he brought all of his commercial and business knowledge on television and advertisement to the field of politics.\n\nYet there are also other pressing problems that contribute in making him so successful. The current condition of the opposition, too fragmented and unable to come up with a valid alternative is an example of this. Obviously the situations in which Berlusconi finds himself make him an easy target for all sorts of criticism, but this tactic can work well when in opposition, but not when leading the country. People want plans, schemes and so forth and the opposition party has been lacking in this aspect, failing to provide the advantages that could incur if the people chose their party rather than the one of Berlusconi. In this big potpourri a part is played by people like me, Italians moving abroad, often too worried or busy to please the general views of their foreign interlocutor in the matter, rather than taking time in actually explaining the problems that lie at the core and the deeper motives.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1981\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"255\" caption=\"At least he keeps things interesting...\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/newsofap.com4cd0932850120Berlusconi.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1981\" title=\"newsofap.com4cd0932850120Berlusconi\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/newsofap.com4cd0932850120Berlusconi-255x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"255\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nWhat we are left with in Italy at the moment is a number of unanswered questions and uncertainty about the near future. Will elections have to be held before the end of the mandate of the government? Is it right to grant the prime minister immunity from civil and criminal lawsuits? Can a man, regularly involved in more or less serious scandals, govern a country living in the fear of the next bigger and more incredible scandal? And finally what will be the outcome of the court case that sees Berlusconi charged with malfeasance in office and promotion of underage prostitution? We'll have to wait and see but the only thing we know for now is that for some ironic turn of fate, his trial is going to be decided by three female judges.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/W3k9pMtrccQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>", "Imageurl": "1980", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1979", "Heading": "Burlesque-oni"}
