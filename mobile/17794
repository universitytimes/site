{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Tom Myatt</strong> | News Staff</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A former Trinity student, who has come to national attention as a volunteer teaching deprived children in India, is urging students to take another look at volunteer work. Amy Mulcahy&rsquo;s decision to enter this field, she maintains, changed not only her career but her entire life.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Searching for summer voluntary work, former Astrophysics student Amy, from Castleknock in Dublin, decided to take up a ten-week teaching placement in Calcutta with SUAS, Ireland&rsquo;s main charity supporting educational development. She pursued this new-found passion and later returned to assist in a makeshift Delhi school.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After graduating, Amy continued her work with another volunteer program in Nepal for the Umbrella Foundation, an Irish-run educational charity. Initially intending to stay for nine months, she has now been there for two and a half years, having been quickly offered a permanent position in Umbrella&rsquo;s management.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amy, now aged 28, has discussed her skills with the TCD Careers Advisory Service, stating that her experiences have taught her to be &ldquo;organised, systematic and logical&rdquo;, abilities which are highly valued in the jobs market around the world.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She says that her voluntary work has given her career a huge boost, as she is now a senior member of the Umbrella Foundation. Outlining her responsibilities in the post, she states: &ldquo;It is my job to evaluate what the impact of&hellip;projects will [be] on Umbrella in 2, 5 or 10 years&rsquo; time. I assess whether we have clear objectives, clearly defined markers and targets, an achievable plan of action and the necessary resources, be it people or money. I have to be practical.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With the attainment of such high-level managerial skills in mind, Amy advises Trinity students to take a second look at voluntary work for career prospects, stressing that the voluntary sector is a highly rewarding area of work.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Even if you don't necessarily want a career in this sector I think volunteering will teach you so much about yourself and broaden your views on the world around you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;It is not like working for a faceless corporation where you are working to make profits, to earn more dividends for the shareholders. Our stakeholders are the children, our profit is their future.&rdquo;</p>\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "17794", "Heading": "Summer Volunteering Helped Trinity Student towards New Career"}
