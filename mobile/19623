{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Over 1,200 students are expected to gather tomorrow in an attempt to break the Guinness World Record for the most people spooning at one time.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event will take place at 1pm in the courtyard of Dublin Institute of Technology, Aungier Street. It is free of charge and completely open to the public. Participants hope to break the current record of 1,108, set by a conference of Australian medical students in July.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spearheaded by Lysette Golden, a Bar Management student studying in DIT, the effort has united several DIT Societies and the DITSU Ents and Welfare offices, who have been using social media to generate student enthusiasm towards the attempt. The DIT Welfare team will also be distributing condoms on the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spooning is considered an expression of intimacy, characterised by placing one&rsquo;s arms around the person in front and lying chest to back. In order to qualify as Guinness World record holders, over 1,108 participants must spoon for five minutes or more without breaking the spooning chain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The event coincides neatly with Dublin&rsquo;s annual Arthur&rsquo;s Day festival, which consists of a series of music events in celebration of the illustrious Guinness Brewery.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anyone wishing to get involved in the event can email Will Meara, DIT Ents officer, at events@ditsu.ie.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Photo: Matthew Daley</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/213486-1_most-_people_spooning_-simultaneously_Australia-1.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19623", "Heading": "DIT Students to Tackle Guinness World Record for Spooning"}
