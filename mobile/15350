His style in winning was so impressive that the Champion Hurdle was being mentioned as a possible target. Since then connections have wisely confirmed the supreme as his race, for which he will of course be a major player. Favourites have a poor record in the race and at the prices I'd been keen to take him on.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Heading the Irish challenge and second in the market is Jessica Harrington's </span><strong style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jezki</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">. Despite a largely unimpressive performance in last year's Champion Bumper this horse has done nothing wrong since transferring to obstacles, remaining unbeaten in its four starts in Ireland which included 2 grade ones. While the form is excellent it comes with a warning, Jezki's wins have all come on heavy ground against small fields which we are unlikely to get at Cheltenham. If the ground comes up soft get involved otherwise he's best watched.</span>\n\nAs expected Willie Mullins will travel to Cheltenham with a particularly strong hand and this race is no different. Of his four, Gigginstown's <strong>Un Atout</strong> is most popular with punters. The 5/1 shot has raced twice this season, dismissing average opposition with ease on both occasions. If that wasn't enough jockey Davy Russell has described the horse to be better than Gold Cup second favourite Sir Des Champs for his age.\n\nOf Mullins' other runners <strong>Champagne Fever,</strong> last year's Champion Bumper winner, is most interesting. The 12/1 outsider had failed to fire this season until finally getting his career back on track with victory in a Grade one at Leopardstown. The strong pace and softer ground of the supreme should leave him with a fighting chance coming over the last. Mullins is also represented by <strong>Pique Sous </strong>and<strong> Mozoltov, </strong>both of whom carry outside chances.\n\n<strong>Melodic Rendevouz </strong>provided Jeremy Scott with his 1st grade one winner in the Tolworth Hurdle and has to be respected. He subsequently beat Puffin Billy and although his form is good I think he'll find one or two of his competitors too good.\n\nPaul Nicholls' second season novice <strong>Dodging Bullets</strong> is a horse that has gone somewhat under the radar in recent months. The five year old was last seen when racing outside novice company finishing third behind the ill fated Darlan in the Christmas Hurdle, form that some view as good as My Tent or Yours Betfair Hurdle run. In truth, its probably unlikely that he's as good as the favourite but at 10/1\u00a0 he's surely good value.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Win Selection: Jezki</strong>\n<strong>E/W Selection: Champagne Fever</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tuesday 14.05: Arkle Novices Chase (Grade 1)</strong>\n\nFor many the Arkle is all about one horse, the Nicky Henderson trained <strong>Simonsig</strong>. An impressive winner of the Neptune at last year's festival, the horse has barely put a foot wrong since. He remains undefeated over the larger obstacles and in recent days Henderson has described his pre Cheltenham work as \"simply fantastic\". Priced at 4/6 he has become some people's banker of the festival, which says a lot considering the quality of the week's other short priced favourites. Simonsig should win but I think he is best watched.\n\nPerhaps the one horse that can perhaps give Simonsig something to think about is the Donald McCain trained <strong>Overturn</strong>. Second in last year's champion hurdle and winner of the Chester Cup on the flat this horse clearly has class. His front running tactics will ensure that the race is a true test and should Simonsig fail to fire Overturn should be the one to capitalise. The e/w price has gone but he's certainly the most likely second for those interested in betting without the favourite.\n\nThe Irish challenge is headed by Willie Mullins' 8/1 shot <strong>Arvika Ligeonnaire</strong> and Tony Martin's <strong>Benefficient</strong> a 16/1 outsider. The former is already a multiple grade one winner this season but that form has come on heavy ground against horses not at the same level as those heading this market. Benefficient who has already travelled to England this season when placing at Newbury perhaps makes more appeal at the prices and I wouldn't be too surprised if he ran into a place. Tony Martin reporting to be extremely pleased with the horse after a recent Leopardstown gallop.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Selection: Simonsig</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tuesday 14.40: JLT Speciality Handicap Chase</strong>\n\nThe first and perhaps the most attritional of the festival handicaps, the JLT Handicap Chase is very much survival of the fittest.\n\nThe market is currently headed by Donald McCain's <strong>Our Mick</strong>, the horse ran third in the same race last year when inexperience and youth may have cost him. The handicapper has only risen the horse one pound since and while he unseated on his only start this season, he had been travelling particularly well in a race won by former Gold Cup outsider Katenko. Short priced horses have a good record in this race and at 6/1 Our Mick may well continue that trend.\n\nLast year's winner <strong>Alfie Sherrin</strong> bids to defend his title following a relatively unremarkable season. Last seen when finishing 7th behind Colbert Station at Leopardstown, Sherrin is thought to be a spring horse and It wouldn't be that big a surprise should be pull it out of the bag again.\n\nAnother certainly in with a chance is Paul Webber's <strong>Cantlow</strong>. The unexposed eight year old has done little wrong since going chasing and could be ahead of the handicapper. Priced at 8/1, a McManus Gamble on the day could be the greatest indicator of this horse's chance.\n\nThe second horse in last year's race <strong>Fruity O'Rooney</strong> has been aimed at this race all season and trainer Garry Moore is hopeful he can go one better. Rarely out of the places, the ultra consistent Fruity will thrive on the better ground while a generous handicap mark leaves him well in contention.\n\nAnother noteworthy runner is Cheltenham specialist <strong>Midnight Chase</strong> who drops back to handicap company after some sterling efforts in graded races over the last couple of seasons. The good ground shout suit and his Cheltenham form is undeniable having won there on five previous occasions. At 14/1 he will surely attract some each-way money.\n\nFurther down the betting the Mich Channon trained <strong>Loch Ba</strong> also catches the eye. The 7 year old was impressive when winning at Newbury in January and is regarded very highly by the trainer. The track should suit him and at 16/1 you could do worse.\n\nPhillip Hobbs' <strong>Planet of Sound </strong>is another who could go well on drying ground. Priced at 25/1, he ran well when coming third in less than ideal conditions at a December Cheltenham handicap and could go well if he gets conditions to suit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Win Selection: Our Mick</strong>\n<strong>E/W Selection: Loch Ba</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tuesday 15.20: Champion Hurdle (Grade 1)</strong>\n\nFor many the Cheltenham Champion Hurdle is one of the races of the season, the ultimate test of speed and agility for top two mile hurdlers.\n\n<strong>Hurricane Fly </strong>returns to Cheltenham to do what no horse has done since Comedy of Errors in 1975 and reclaim the Champion Hurdle crown. Trainer Willie Mullins has described the horse as being back to his best after disappointing last season and the he looked as impressive as ever when winning the irish champion hurdle last month. Doubters point to the fact that the Fly has shown us nothing extra in beating Irish horses that everyone knows he is already better than.\u00a0 My feeling is that Hurricane Fly on his best form is in a different league to this opposition and should win. The only question that remains is which Hurricane Fly will show up.\n\nThe opposition to The Fly is headed by Paul Nicholls' <strong>Zarkander</strong>, winner of the Triumph hurdle in 2011. While only fifth in the race last year, he seems to have matured with two impressive victories behind him. Notably he put away reopposing rivals in the form of Rock on Ruby and Grandouet at Cheltenham although it was thought both needed the run and If I was to oppose the Fly I think I would look beyond him.\n\n<strong>Rock on Ruby</strong> was the surprise victor of last year's race but can't easily be discounted to retain his crown.\u00a0 The horse has that extra bit of stamina needed to compete at Cheltenham, the very stamina that helped him win last year when staying on strongly up the Cheltenham hill. Trainer Harry Fry is in confident mood and thinks his horse will take a lot of beating. While his form this season has been mixed with his one win coming through default following Darlan's fatal fall, one has to think that he'll improve for better ground and is certainly a major player.\n\nThe horse Im particuarly keen on is Nicky Henderson's <strong>Grandouet. </strong>The 6/1 shot missed its prep run due to an infection but if there's any trainer to get a horse ready without a prep run its Nicky Henderson. His narrow defeat to Zarkander was at a time when the horse needed the run having been off the track for a year. The 6 year old is sure to improve for good ground and his quick turn of foot makes him a serious contender.\n\nOther candidates include <strong>Cinders and Ashes </strong>and <strong>Countrywide Flame. </strong>The former went through last season unbeaten culminating in victory in the supreme novices hurdle. Unfortunately, his form this year has not lived up to that promise being comfortably defeated twice at the highest level. At 10/1 he doesn't offer much temptation. On the other hand, last year's Triumph winner Countrywide Flame got his season off to a flyer with impressive victory over Cinders and Ashes in the grade one Fighting Fifth hurdle before being seen off comfortably by the ill fated Darlan at Christmas. Of the two Countrywide Flame makes most appeal but I wouldn't be having a bet on either.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Win Selection: Grandouet </strong>(Paddy Power special: Money back if Hurricane Fly wins)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tuesday 16.00: Cross Country Chase\u00a0</strong>\n\nEnda Bolger has been somewhat of a cross country master since the races inception and this year he seems to again carry a strong hand in the form of <strong>Arabella Boy</strong>. The eight year old has been given somewhat of a rebirth since transferring to the banks. Twice a winner at Punchestown, the 6/1 shot got some much needed experience at Cheltenham when going well before unseating Nina Carberry in December.\n\nSecond the market and last year's winner is Phillip Hobbs' <strong>Balthazar King</strong>. Although an impressive winner last year he returns off a 7 pounds higher mark, a mark that saw him lose to Uncle Junior at the December meeting. The Spring ground should help but I would be surprised if he was capable of retaining his crown.\n\nA horse Im very keen on is the former RSA winner <strong>Bostons Angel</strong>. Jessica Harrington's chaser had lost its way a bit last season<strong> </strong>but seems to have been rejuvenated since transferring to the banks. He adds a touch of class to the race and having twice finished second in cross country races already this season I am hoping he can go one better.\n\n<strong>Outlaw Pete</strong> won the main trail for this race in December on very testing ground and is certainly worthy of respect. Little known trainer John Halley will be hoping for his 1st big race success although when push comes to shove he may find one or two of these too good on the day.\n\nOf the contenders further down the market I can't help but be drawn to veteran <strong>A New Story </strong>available at 25/1. The 14 year old has performed remarkably well in past runnings of this race, only finishing out of the places once on his last 4 appearances. In what should be his final race I wouldn't be surprised if he became the second 14 year old to claim big race success this season following Hello Buds epic Beacher Chase win.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Win Selection: Bostons Angel\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>E/W Selection: A New Story</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tuesday 16.40: OLBG David Nicholson Mares Hurdle (Grade 2)</strong>\n\nIn recent years the OLBB Mares hurdle has become somewhat of a procession. Willie Mullins' super mare <strong>Quevega</strong> has won the last four on the bounce and returns this year eyeing up more glory. Despite a World Hurdle entry Mullins' assures us that this is the primary target. Priced at 8/15, she isn't much of a price from a betting perspective although she's clearly a different class to these opponents and barring any major mishaps she will win.\n\nIn what looks a battle for place money Nicky Henderson's <strong>Une Artiste</strong> is second in the betting at around 5/1. Last year's Fred Winter winner has won both starts this term but I think I speak for most when I say I'd be utterly shocked if she troubled Quevega. Nonetheless, Simon Muinir's horse definitely has strong place claims.\n\nAnother horse prominent in the betting is the Emma Lavelle trained <strong>Kentford Grey Lady</strong> who has been a model of consistency throughout her career. Second in this race last year, she began this season with an impressive victory at Sandown before coming up short to Une Artiste and then running a blinder behind World Hurdle second favourite Reve de Sivola in the Cleeve Hurdle. The horse should improve for the better ground and I'd fancy her to reverse form with Une Artiste at the festival.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Selection: Quevega</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Tuesday 17.15: PLI Novices Handicap Chase</strong>\n\nRacing off a chase mark 12 lower than its mark over hurdles Gordon Elliot has every chance of nabbing the PlI Novices Handicap Chase with past festival winner <strong>Carlito Brigante</strong>, just shy of top class Carlito lines up having been aimed at this race for a number of months.\n\nMalcolm Jefferson's <strong>Ataglance</strong> is another to keep an eye on. Winner of the Martin pipe at last year's festival, he has had a less than inspiring season to date, however, I am confident that better ground at a track he loves will make him a major player off a very low handicap mark.\n\nAnother interesting contender is the Phillip Hobbs' <strong>Colour Squadron</strong>. Twice placed in grade ones, this horse clearly has ability and if he can get his sometimes erratic jumping in order he should be a major player off a relatively low handicap mark. If his price begins to tumble on the day at the hands of a McManus gamble it might prove fruitful to follow suit.\n\nThere have been whispers for <strong>The Druids Nephew</strong> from the small yard of Andy Turnell. Valiant in a November defeat to RSA fancy Hadrian Approach, he has a nice racing mark of 135 which should leave him towards the bottom of the weights. His other other form has worked out nicely and he could well give the Turnell yard a first big race success.\n\nOf those less prominent in the betting <strong>Rouge Et Blanc </strong>is of some interest. Trained by Oliver Sherwood the eight year old has been compared to last year's winner Hunt Ball in that he is a horse on a steep upward curve. He's won his last two starts and at 20/1 he could yet cause an upset.\n\nSimilarly last year's second <strong>White Star Line </strong>could perhaps sneak a place. He has since been a consistent placer behind some decent horses and off a 3 pound lower mark could easily be in the frame at big odds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Win Selection: The Druids Nephew</strong>", "Imageurl": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/03/12/cheltenham-13-day-one-preview/cheltenham/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-15351\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-15351\" title=\"cheltenham\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cheltenham8-1024x379.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"549\" height=\"203\" /></a></p>\n<strong>Conor Williams</strong> | Contributing writer\n\n<strong>Tuesday 13.30: Supreme Novices Hurdle (Grade 1)</strong>\n\nAs the curtain raiser of the festival, it is of little surprise that The Supreme Novices Hurdle is normally one of the biggest betting races of the meeting and this year seems no different!\n\nTopping the market is the JP McManus owned and Nicky Henderson trained <strong>My Tent or Yours</strong> with his performance in the Betfair Hurdle making him a worthy 7/4 favourite.
