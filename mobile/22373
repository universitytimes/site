The mice that did not have the gene also displayed unusual responses to amphetamine. The stimulant had the effect of reducing levels of hyperactivity in the mice, whereas it normally induces such behaviour in animals that do possess the Elfn1 gene. This observation is comparable to the fact that amphetamine is sometimes used as part of treatment for ADHD, as it has a calming effect on patients. Dr. Dolan said that the findings of the experiment &ldquo;clearly show that removal of the Elfn1 gene affects brain circuits with multiple consequences for behaviour&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Findings of the experiment &ldquo;clearly show that removal of the Elfn1 gene affects brain circuits with multiple consequences for behaviour&rdquo;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The research will contribute to study on whether or not mutations of the gene in humans cause similar symptoms. On the experiment, Prof. Mitchell stated: &ldquo;We are at the beginning of this process of figuring out how this gene works and understanding the consequences when it is mutated. But, these animals provide a unique model to investigate how subtle changes in brain development can ultimately result in aberrant brain function.&rdquo;</p>\r\nThe Elfn1 gene was originally discovered by Prof. Mitchell, Dr. Dolan and their colleagues in 2007. The research has been outlined in the international scientific journal PLOS ONE, and was funded by Science Foundation Ireland.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/LabGroup_photo-2006.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22373", "Heading": "Discovery by Trinity Scientists Could Increase Understanding of ADHD"}
