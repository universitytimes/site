However; it was Mohammad&rsquo;s account of 17 year old Ali-Reza Mulla-Hasani&rsquo;s execution in September 2011 that stirred the audience most.\n\nAli-Reza was convicted of manslaughter after drawing a knife on a man during a fight.\u00a0 Mohammad stresses this action was taken due to a &ldquo;lack of intellectual growth&rdquo; and &ldquo;cultural deficit&rdquo; among other factors.\u00a0 Yet, Ali-Reza was sentenced to a public execution by hanging after an unfair and severely curtailed trial.\u00a0 Mohammad described his murder as unvoluntary and that he nearly fell a few times on the scaffold and when he was hung &ldquo;a nation witnessed the trembling of his body and his death.&rdquo;\n\nThere are two categories of thoughts and deeds that fit the profiles of states which implement execution as punishment for criminals according to Mohammad.\n\nThe first category Mohammad outlined for the audience encompassed the Islamic states employing extreme interpretations of Shari&rsquo;a Law.\u00a0 This particular legal system has gained notoriety amongst western societies and Mohammad feels that the essence of its cruelty comes from harsh interpretations by judiciaries.\u00a0 It operates on the basis of <em>Qerases </em>according to Mohammad which promotes &lsquo;eye for an eye&rsquo; sentences and judiciaries justify the death penalty with selective &ldquo;<em>Qur&rsquo;anic</em> verses&rdquo;. He believes that Shari&rsquo;a could be interpreted differently and that the severity of Shari&rsquo;a has led many Muslims to turn away from their religion.\n\nThe second category Mohammad spoke of related to governments who are incapable and incompetent in managing the social, political, cultural and economic spheres in a balanced manner.\u00a0 In the case of Iran, Mohammad believes that execution is a politically repressive tool for an authoritarian regime.\u00a0 It prevents political diversity and spreads fear amongst the population so that the government can maintain its control.\n\n&lsquo;In Iran I was a defence lawyer for a youth who went before the gallows seven times but each time somehow I managed to save him.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet this youth, Behnood Shojai, was finally executed while thousands of Iranian people, some famous artists and political figures, demanded for him not to be executed.\u00a0 Nonetheless he was hanged before my unbelieving eyes.&rsquo;\u00a0 Obviously, the thought of a minor being sentenced to death in Ireland is unthinkable in the 21<sup>st</sup> century but it is common practice in Iran and Saudi.\n\nInterestingly enough in a brief interview with Mohammad and Sheelan, who was kind enough to translate, he explained that he firmly believed that in Iran the interests of the government lay in the country&rsquo;s rich natural resources rather than the welfare of its people.\n\nHow does Mohammad envisage a change coming about in Iran?\u00a0 &ldquo;When Troy Davis (a death row prisoner for 22 years) was executed for murder in the U.S., hundreds of thousands were opposed to his death.\u00a0 Eventually, people will rise up in Iran and a spark will light a fire for revolution.&rdquo;\u00a0 Although the two countries have many differences it is the free press and independent judiciary that are needed in Iran in Mohammad&rsquo;s opinion.\u00a0 The power of the Iranian government will wain over time but Mohammad is insistent that people must be aware of the fact that the current rulers in Iran are not representative of most Iranian people.\u00a0 In fact Mohammad likens the incumbents&rsquo; policies to those of Muammar Gaddafi.\u00a0 If an electoral system can develop in Iran to meet internationally recognised democratic standards of say the U.N, then there will be progress in law reform.\n\nWould Mohammad himself run for public office?\u00a0 &ldquo;I prefer to be a witness and to point towards wrong doers!&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;I like to discuss things.\u00a0 I would have no real interest in candidacy.&rdquo; \u00a0He reiterated the role that citizens in established democracies like Ireland can play; lobbying the government and international bodies like the U.N to put pressure on countries with considerable human rights abuses.\u00a0 However, he feels many of the western powers are more concerned with their own material interests abroad rather than human rights abuses.\n\nMohammad&rsquo;s ultimate dream is to see a world without the death penalty and barbaric punishments.\u00a0 He wants to see a world where everyone has their right to a defence honoured.\u00a0 The 21<sup>st</sup> century calls for progressive prison sentences such as life terms without parole. The technology and facilities are available to rehabilitate prisoners.\u00a0 One could not doubt the audacity of Mohammad Mostafaei and his outstanding success in defending the lives of those convicted.\n\nHowever, in a world where political trends show the fight between dictatorship and democracy is still raging, we might be waiting a while longer for Mohammad&rsquo;s dream.\n\nMost credit should be even to TCD's Scholar's at Risk Committee for organizing such a fascinating event. According to\u00a0Dr. Roja Fazaeli, chair of the SAR committee and lecturer of Islamic studies:\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px;\">The lecture was primarily organised by the SAR committee in TCD as a part of an ongoing SAR lecture series to raise awareness and promote the work of the Scholars at Risk Network (TCD is a member). We applied for the equality fund last year and were successful in attaining it. We invited Mostafaei at least six months ago and later on Amnesty Ireland asked through the SAR committee to invite him to do a tour of Ireland. Two weeks to the event I asked the TCD DU Amnesty to join the event.\u00a0</span></span><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; font-size: small; line-height: normal;\">The work of Mostafaei is definitely very important and SAR committee is there to help individuals like Mostafaei. The lecture series is meant to not only highlight the person but also the work of SAR so we can get support in the future as no one knows about us.</span></blockquote>\n<em><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE-b2fwA32c\">\nChildren on Death Row in Iran, Mohammad Mostafaei and his Work</a>\u00a0</em>\n<em>Follow DU Amensty on <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/DU-Amnesty-International-Trinity-College-Dublin/108449822553274\">Facebook</a></em>", "Imageurl": "5362", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5361", "Heading": "The Price of Life"}
