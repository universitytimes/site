Refused entry by Custom House security, USI President Gary Redmond decided to climb over the railings and pitch his tent. Redmond was informed by Custom House security that the Garda\u00ed had been called and were on their way but this left Redmond unfazed, as such a development had been expected.\n\nWhen the Garda\u00ed arrived they did little more than watch the students pitching their tents and chat among themselves. Eventually they agreed to let the protestors stay the night.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3716\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"491\" caption=\"USI President Gary Redmond climbs the Custom House railing.\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=3716\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3716\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3716  \" title=\"IMG_0825\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_0825-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"491\" height=\"327\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe purpose of the protest is to call on\u00a0Minister for the Environment Phil Hogan T.D. to establish a Deposit Protection Scheme, which will protect students from being defrauded by rogue\u00a0landlords.\n\nUSI claim that research they have carried out shows that\u00a040% of students have had their deposit unfairly withheld, that\u00a075% of cases reported to the PRTB are in relation to the deposit retention and that over 60% of students have had over &euro;200 unfairly taken off their deposit.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3721\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"491\" caption=\"Garda\u00ed look on as the student reps pitch their tents.\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=3721\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3721\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3721  \" title=\"IMG_0840\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_0840-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"491\" height=\"327\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUSI President Gary Redmond said , \"Each year, students' unions across the country and USI are contacted by distraught students about their rogue landlords, who refuse to return deposits without any legitimate reason.\n\nUSI is calling on the Government to establish a Deposit Protection Scheme, where the deposit is held by an independent agency such as the PRTB protecting students from unlawful actions of some landlords.\n\nThe DPS offers a cost effective way of supporting tenants and will eradicate the exploitation of students by unscrupulous landlords, who are deliberately targeting students and retaining their deposits illegally.\n\nWith students &amp; their families struggling to afford the basic costs of attending college this situation cannot be allowed to continue. On average, students will pay at least &euro;3,500 on rent over the academic year and will also have to hand over a large deposit.\n\nAcross the country many landlords and students have excellent relationships where students rent from the same landlord year after year however unfortunately some landlords see young students as an easy target for exploitation. I am calling on the Minister to implement the Deposit Protection Scheme promised in the programme for Government without delay to protect vulnerable students from rogue landlords.&rdquo;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3724\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"491\" caption=\"USI President Gary Redmond\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=3724\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3724\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-3724  \" title=\"IMG_0860\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/IMG_0860-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"491\" height=\"327\" /></a>[/caption]", "Imageurl": "3825", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "3704", "Heading": "USI Officers climb Custom House railings in sleep out protest against crooked landlords "}
