In our lives sport will grip us. It will cause us joy and sorrow.\u00a0It might start friendships and it might end some. But in the end sport is trivial.\u00a0Ballynahinch RFC know this better than anyone. The tragic passing of Nevin\u00a0Spence along with his brother and father, all proud players for the club cast a\u00a0cold light on what is really important. The memory of Spence is surely to the\nforefront of both Ballynahinch and Ulster as they ride on the crest of a wave at\u00a0the moment. Ulster are chasing the very real possibility of a second European\u00a0Cup, while Ballynahinch are favourites to grab promotion to UBL Division 1A.\u00a0The eloquent words of Johann Muller have forever etched Spence&rsquo;s name in\u00a0the annals of history when he remarked &lsquo;that as long as this great club exists\u00a0the name of Nevin Spence will never be forgotten&rsquo;. With that in mind it can\u00a0be hard to really assess the significance of this result for both clubs, as\nwhen all is said and done, sport remains a trivial issue. Ballynahinch have had\u00a0a remarkable season remaining unbeaten and their draw against Malone in\u00a0their last encounter is the closest someone has come to stopping this awesome\u00a0juggernaut.\n\nThe game was moved at short notice to nearby Wallace High School, away from\u00a0the oppressive and intimidating Ballymacarn Park. Ballynahinch&rsquo;s home ground\u00a0sits on top of a hill and as such attracts weather of a fairly biblical proportion. It\u00a0didn&rsquo;t stop the heavens from opening with rain and gale-force winds playing\u00a0against both sides. Ballynahinch have a big pack, and play a simple if somewhat\u00a0rudimentary style of rugby. Their back three is pacy and have no problems\u00a0counter-attacking, but the rest of the game is built on pretty simple elements.\u00a0Their outhalf Tim Small knows every sinew of the pitch and his kicking game was\u00a0ideally suited to the conditions that his side plays in week after week.\n\nTrinity\u00a0struggled to apply their muscle to proceedings from the off as they played\nagainst the wind in appalling conditions. They fronted up admirably with the\u00a0usual suspects such as Pierce Dargan and Collin McDonnell getting through\u00a0spades of work albeit in fruitless circumstance as despite their efforts they\u00a0couldn&rsquo;t break down the resilience of Ballynahinch. Brian Du Toit picked up\u00a0where he left off in 2012 with a few lung-busting breaks but they never really\u00a0panicked &lsquo;Hinch who used their muscle and the wind to test Trinity&rsquo;s aptitude for\u00a0resilience. Trinity&rsquo;s lineout held together very well in the poor conditions.\nRugby is stereotypically touted as a game for all shapes and all sizes. The lineout\u00a0is the one area where this adage does not conform. Height is imperative and\u00a0Trinity are fortunate to have in Dargan, an athletic and rangy jumper, who\u00a0secures clean ball at the back, and is a solid defensive jumper who can disrupt\u00a0opposition targets. Dargan clocks in at 6&rsquo;2. That leaves him a tad short for the\u00a0second-row in the UBL but he nonetheless contributes positively to his side&rsquo;s set\u00a0piece from the flank. Despite problems with the size of the opposition Trinity\u00a0were dominating the breakdown early on in Wallace High School. David Joyce in for the injured Cathal Marsh was unerringly accurate with his right foot slotting\u00a0over four penalties to &lsquo;Hinch&rsquo;s two to make it 12-6 at the break. Trinity&rsquo;s ferocity\u00a0and speed at the breakdown were highly encouraging given the tough conditions and the muscular front five that marked them.\n\nThe second half immediately removed any suspicions the students might have had about &lsquo;Hinch falling away when Chris Quinn scored an excellent try to make 13-12 immediately reversing much of the hard graft done by Trinity in the first half. Following a swift counter-attack from the mercurial David Fanagan, Joyce added another penalty to make it 20-15. William Scott coming in for his second cap in the UBL brought skill and finesse to proceedings when he came off the bench. The game was by now much more open and loose affair and Trinity decided to test Hinch&rsquo;s mettle with their danger man. Niyi Adelokun has been in prolific form this year netting five tries and he truly delivered for the students with a superb individual effort that started in his own half. Joyce was spot on with the conversion to bring it to 22-20. Trinity might have expected a shift in momentum with their set piece dominating and their work at the breakdown still as vicious and competitive as ever. However two penalties brought &lsquo;Hinch back in front 26-22 and try as they might Trinity couldn&rsquo;t get their noses in front. The final whistle shrilled to soberly consign Trinity to another defeat.\n\nTrinity with this result have lost three competitive games on the trot. It is not\u00a0by any means the time to start writing off this team or bring purges to the\u00a0starting XV. They still remain in second place and the small matter of UCD and\u00a0the Colours in less than three weeks is enough to re-energize and refocus the\u00a0team. Trinity can look at the last three games and say they were unfortunate in\u00a0Buccaneers, abysmal against Belfast Harlequins and simply the victim of a team\u00a0driven by something greater than the quest of success. They aren&rsquo;t the first team\u00a0to be put to the sword by Ballynahinch and then will not be the last. Trinity are\u00a0certainly not relegation candidates and while promotion is perhaps becoming a\u00a0tougher hurdle, they will still set their sights on obtaining it.\u00a0Promotion is a very real goal for Ballynahinch and the manner in which they\u00a0dismissed Trinity will provide them with more reassurance that the difficulties\u00a0they face while great are not insurmountable. If the great club of Ballynahinch\u00a0have weathered the heartbreak of Nevin&rsquo;s passing then the challenges of\u00a0whatever their aims this season are can always be reflected against the sombre\u00a0light of that tragedy to remind them all that sport is irrelevant.", "Imageurl": "14597", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14596", "Heading": "Trinity Bested by Ballynahinch"}
