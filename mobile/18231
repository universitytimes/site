A silent disco, traffic light ball and mardi gras rave make up the rest of the week's nights out.\n\nHarris's single \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGghkjpNCQ8&amp;ob=av2e\" target=\"_blank\">Feel so Close</a>\" is currently at number three in the Irish charts and at number five in the UK charts, having peaked at number two in both charts upon its release. This followed the success of \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooZwmeUfuXg&amp;ob=av2e\" target=\"_blank\">Bounce</a>\", another single from his upcoming studio album, which peaked at number six in the Irish charts and number two in the UK charts.\n\nThe Scottish born artists has enjoyed a successful run since his debut album, \"I Created Disco\" was release in 2007, spawning hits singles \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOV5WXISM24&amp;ob=av3n\" target=\"_blank\">Acceptable in the 80s</a>\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwZVZ5qZnoA&amp;ob=av2n\" target=\"_blank\">The Girls</a>\". His second studio album, \"Ready for the Weekend\", was released in 2009 and reached number one in the UK charts. The first single from the album, \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8TPXFoXO5A&amp;ob=av3e\" target=\"_blank\">I'm Not Alone</a>\", debuted in the UK charts at number one.\n\nHarris teamed up with Dizzee Rascal to produce the chart topping hit \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GibLntdLiJA&amp;ob=av3e\">Dance Wiv' Me</a>\", which was performed by Dizzee Rascal when he headlined the Trinity Ball in 2010.\n\nEnts Officer Chris O'Connor said he's \"very excited to have Calvin Harris launching the new Trinity Ents night 'MadHaus @ The Academy'. We couldn't really ask for a better launch for this new non-profit weekly night. We've teamed up with MCD to ensure that the experience will not be like anything seen in a Dublin club before. The resident MadHaus DJ will be flown in from Fabric, a big London club. He'll be supported by DJs from MadHouse DJs, a Dublin based collective. The night will move to Wednesday after Freshers' week. It's a very ambitious project with many big names already confirmed for term one.\"\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ooZwmeUfuXg&amp;ob=av2e", "Imageurl": "4047", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18231", "Heading": "Calvin Harris to play Monday of Freshers&#039; Week"}
