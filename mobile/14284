The pilot scheme will last two academic years, first available\u00a0to students applying to begin their study in\u00a0Trinity\u00a0in September 2014.\n\nTwenty-five places will be offered in the new admissions route with prospective students applying through the CAO in January 2014. 10 places will be available in law and single-honours History while\u00a0a further five will be available for applicants to Ancient &amp; Medieval History and Culture.\n\nTrinity's new pilot admissions system is the brain-child of Senior Lecturer Dr. Patrick Geoghegan. Its objective\u00a0is to ascertain whether it might be possible to develop a new\u00a0national admissions system that can provide a better mechanism to identify and admit\u00a0applicants based on a broader range of criteria than academic ability as determined through formal examination.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>No random selection for selected courses</strong></p>\nWhen applying through the CAO for any of the three courses, students will be given the option of opting out of the study. In this case, they will be eligible for all the places that will be filled using CAO points alone. Applicants taking part in the study will be eligible for both sets of places and all applications will be made\u00a0anonymous\u00a0before consideration.\n\nApplicants seeking to enter into a course of study through the new route will be ranked according to a combination of their Leaving Certificate results, their Relative Performance Rank, and personal and contextual data provided via supplementary materials submitted by the applicant.\n\nThe majority of places on the three courses will be filled in the normal way, through CAO points. The places set aside for the new route\u00a0will be filled once all the other places \u00a0have been allocated through the use of CAO points.\n\nThe new admissions route will \u00a0also be used for any students with equal points who are tied at the minimum points level, meaning there will no random selection in 2013/14 on any of these three courses.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Relative performance</strong></p>\nRelative Performance Rank (RPR) measures the performance of the\u00a0applicant\u00a0relative to other applicants from their school. The scale shall look at the rank of the applicant compared to every other applicant from their school who has applied to any course in any institution through the Central Applications Office (CAO).\n\nThe information submitted will be sent to Trinity where it will be examined by professional readers, and will be presented for evaluation to an independent Admissions Review Committee. All information, including Leaving Certificate results, will then go before a Final Review Committee consisting of internal and external representatives, where the final decision will be made about the allocation of the places.\n\nThe feasibility study aims to inform broader educational change by providing options to assist in the development of national policy and ultimately a new national admissions system. The results will be published and shared throughout the sector. It seeks to complement the role of the Leaving Certificate and the teaching community, by working with the Central Applications Office (CAO) applying approaches which have succeeded internationally to an Irish context.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Pioneering approach to admissions reform</strong></p>\nThe feasibility study builds on the work of the conference on admissions which was held in Trinity May last and was discussed as part of the &lsquo;Communication from the Irish Universities Association (IUA) Council to the Minister for Education and Skills on the matter of Reform of Selection and Entry to University in the Context of National Educational Policy&rsquo;, presented to the Minister for Education and Skills, Ruair\u00ed Quinn, in August 2012.\n\nThe details of new admissions route have been shared with the other Irish universities, through the IUA, and with the institutes of technology through the IOTI. The progress of each stage of the feasibility study (including any problems and obstacles) will be shared with the wider sector.\n\nThe feasibility study will run for at least two years in 2014 and 2015 with procedures and processes evaluated at regular intervals by internal and external experts. It will be assessed under the following criteria: operations; resources; matching students to courses; meaningful results; legal challenges; public trust.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Reactions</strong></p>\n<blockquote>We welcome this opportunity to work with the third-level sector to see a different mechanism for admitting students with the potential and ability to succeed in their chosen courses.\u00a0The new admissions route being tested in this feasibility study has the potential to bring about a significant change to the system of third-level admissions in Ireland in over thirty years, and we are delighted to join with Trinity in a project of national\u00a0significance.</blockquote>\n- Ivor Gleeson, General Manager of the CAO\n<blockquote>The Irish Second Level Students' Union supports the new feasibility study on college admissions about to be carried out by Trinity College.\u00a0In a society where students can contribute in many ways and are talented in various ways, it is unjust that a students test scores from one exam should ultimately be the decider of their future.</blockquote>\n- ISSU President Dylan Grace\n<blockquote>We are conducting this feasibility study because we wish to establish if there is a better and a fairer way to offer college places. Trinity is prepared to test this new admissions route, and we will share the results at every stage across the entire third-level sector.</blockquote>\n- Provost Patrick Prendergast", "Imageurl": "14286", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14284", "Heading": "FULL DETAILS: Trinity's pioneering admissions scheme set for launch"}
