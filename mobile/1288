{"Body": "While out canvassing in the general election, a number of things have surprised me.\n\nFirst, while the response to Fianna F\u00e1il is nowhere near as good as it used to be, or where we would like it to be, it is not as bad as\u00a0I expected it to be. Fianna F\u00e1il canvassers need to bear in mind that, even in the boom times, 60% of people never voted for us. If two out of ten houses say they are voting FF this time, that's a decent result. If three out of ten say it, then FF are heading for a very good result, all things considered.\n\nSecond, the lack of local issues coming up on the doorsteps is amazing and unprecedented (it is also to be welcomed). Last Sunday, for example, I must have knocked on over 100 doors. I got one 'rep' (representation, constituency work for the candidate to follow up on). Even that one rep was about a serious personal issue and wasn't the standard 'pothole needs filling' or 'grass needs cutting' issue that would have come up before.\n\nThird, there are a lot of people out there who are seriously disaffected with politics and politicians and don't know who to vote for. Having spoken to a lot of them on the doorsteps, my anecdotal view is that many of these people are former Fianna F\u00e1il voters who are searching around for an alternative this time.\n\nA number of things strike me about this category of voters:\n<ol>\n<li>If Miche\u00e1l Martin can finish this campaign as strongly as he has started it, there is a chance that a proportion of these people will hold their noses and vote FF again.</li>\n<li>The gap in the market for a new political party that was identified before the election definitely exists and may still be open to be filled after the election.</li>\n<li>The opposition have totally failed to seal the deal with these voters, after all if they are still undecided at this point what is it going to take to convince them?</li>\n</ol>\nWhile the failure of the opposition to convince the electorate may help FF save some seats, in the long term this 'plague on all your houses' view on politics has the potential to be very corrosive to democracy.\n\nPerhaps the greatest failing of\u00a0all political parties\u00a0in Ireland right now is the inability of any of them to provide any hope, confidence of inspiration to the electorate.
