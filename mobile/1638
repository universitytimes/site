{"Body": "Mickey Quinn-\n\nGiven the incessant media coverage of the impending Irish Republican Apocalypse, the employment famine and the crime of the banker, it is sometimes relaxing to divert your gaze to sunnier climes. Let me guide your eyes to Barcelona.\n\nUpon graduating from Trinity 2 and a half years ago, I embarked on a 19 month stint working as a well-paid lapdog in a big corporate office on the quays. I gained a lot of experience but it wasn&rsquo;t what I wanted. After coming to my senses, I completed the CELTA course for teaching English and made the trip to Barcelona.\n\nI was very fortunate in that I knew some people here, and it influenced my destination decision somewhat. However, for the more adventurous of you who may not have contacts here, Barcelona is a place where you can find your feet relatively easily. That said, there are pitfalls and obstacles &ndash; some of them are massive!\n\nFirst of all, reject the instinctive idea of moving into the first or second flat you look at. Most of you reading this will say; &lsquo;I would never do that&rsquo;, but the mind does funny things when it is out of its comfort zone and I know many people who will vouch for that. The difference with living in Dublin and living here is that you will probably have to move in with strangers from the outset, in a professional capacity. This is a lot different from moving in with a load of Eton boys in Trinity Hall; this is dealing with strong minded people who speak a foreign language. Eton boys tend to be wrong minded people who speak a foreign language &ndash; but that&rsquo;s just my opinion.\n\nRent is cheap and the contracts are dangerous. You might be kicked out on your arse at any time, and nobody ever seems to know who the landlord is, but this is all part of the experience. Make sure there is one person you can communicate with freely in your flat, as you might need them if someone decides to take advantage of your inexperience and the mierda hits the pan. Yes I am speaking from experience (still scarred but NOT defeated)!\n\nDon&rsquo;t panic: this place will treat you right if you look hard enough. There are some fantastic people here who can introduce you to some fantastic new realities and although that sounds like an advert for California, it is much less plastic. Barcelona has everything the standard mammal can ask for. If you are a touch bog-standard (like me) it also has a terrible amount of Irish bars. Terrible, I must add, is the operative word; yet more fool I. Credit where credit is due though, I am a bit of a homeboy and if ever I feel a bit homesick, these taverns of doom more than scratch my itch.\n\nDespite the stereotype of the &rsquo;miserable&rsquo; Catalans, the people are kind and responsive. I have found myself shedding some of the cynicism that my education affected me with. They are open, friendly and interested in Irish people (funnily enough). In fact, after receiving my badge of honour for the endurance test which was ERASMUS in Salamanca, I can truthfully say that I prefer these stubborn Catalans. There is a hell of a lot of character to be found in them.\n\nIf you are tempted to leave the poisoned glen of Eireann, I more than strongly recommend the variety that is Catalu\u0144a. The beauty of this is that you can get a flat, a job and some friends on www.loquo.com (also check out the language/music/conversation exchanges available on the website) even before you leave your house in Dublin. Like anywhere, it takes some time to settle in. There can be dark days and some trouble &ndash; but there is a lot in yourself you can find by coming to this place.\n", "Imageurl": "1639", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1638", "Heading": "Homage to Catalonia "}
