{"Body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago my Saturday night was spent like any other, in pyjamas in front of the TV happily giving into an hour of &lsquo;X-Factor&rsquo; indulgence.

I, on the other hand, was inspired. It was mesmerizing. It was fashion-forward yet wonderfully flattering. Sometimes designers take one step too many into the realm of &lsquo;originality&rsquo;, their end-products resembling costumes from a pantomime or an opera more than anything else.

He graduated in March of this year with distinction in MA fashion and in the same month won the Harrods Design Award (an award which Christopher Kane had previously won in 2006) for his graduation collection which boasted many black and flesh-toned body-conscious dresses with metallic tubing and colourful chain embellishments. The collection showcased his signature style which focuses on strong shapes and tries to convey a powerful sexuality.

Over the seven seasons which it has run so far, the event has showcased over one hundred and thirty designers including William Tempest.</p>\n<p>The collection consists of bold, futuristic dresses with daring shapes and cut-outs. While neutral tones and black and white dominate, they are sharply contrasted with bursts of vibrant colours, pink and orange. Many of the dresses are reminiscent of tennis dresses, summery and playful.

Moreover, Beyonc&eacute; recently wore an off-the-shoulder dress designed specifically with her in mind to the MTV Europe Music Awards in Berlin. It was similar to Cheryl&rsquo;s, but with an even greater abundance of metallic embellishment. When asked how he felt about celebrities such as Beyonc&eacute; wearing his clothes, Koma expressed that he was both proud and privileged. And let&rsquo;s face it, who wouldn&rsquo;t be?

The New Generation Scheme is run by London Fashion Council and sponsored by Topshop.
