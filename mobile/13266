Kennedy&rsquo;s Presidential Election 2012</em>\n\nLast night was our night, and what a night it was.\n\nAs darkness descended on Washington, DC, this blogger found himself in the company of about five hundred Georgetown University Democrats, all transfixed to the big screen as Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper gave us a second-by-second breakdown of the results of Election 2012. When I arrived, Mitt Romney was leading the popular and electoral vote by some margin, with the critical swing states still all to play for.\n\nCautious applause and playful booing ensued as each candidate took their respective Blue and Red states, but as CNN began its series of &ldquo;projections&rdquo; on key races the tension became palpable. The President took Pennsylvania and New Hampshire, sending the room rattling with uproarious approval; clearly, many in the media had underestimated the positive influence Obama&rsquo;s management of Sandy would have on voters in battleground states.\n\nFurther fuel to the fire of hope burning in the Leavey Centre was provided by a generous batch of electoral votes, courtesy of big hitters California, Washington and Hawaii. Wins in Idaho, Nebraska and particularly North Carolina did claw back some ground for the GOP contender, but his path to the White House was looking narrower and narrower &ndash; as we spectators got louder and louder.\n\nThe place was, in the immortal words of Ke$ha, &ldquo;about to blow&rdquo;, and the final spark came at 11.20pm as Obama took Iowa and the state Romney absolutely had to win &ndash; Ohio &ndash; prompting CNN to call the election for the incumbent. A deafening roar engulfed the crowd, followed by a euphoric hysteria that had total strangers screaming, tears gushing, and hugging one another with the fervour of long lost siblings.\n\nAs much as two years (or, in my case, one afternoon) of hard campaigning behind them, Georgetown&rsquo;s politically energised students were ready to blow off some steam. Cries of &ldquo;to the White House!&rdquo; rang out, and within five minutes an impromptu DC city marathon had begun, with literally thousands of young people pegging it down M Street and onto the iconic Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThe overjoyed yelps of sprinting coeds and blaring horns of passing cabs did little to prepare us for the sight that awaited us at Barack Obama&rsquo;s home for another four years. D.C. itself voted 91% in the President&rsquo;s favour, and it seemed like every single one of those voters had gathered by the North Front last night to celebrate.\n\nCameras flashed, revellers chanted, musicians played, reporters spoke, and trees almost buckled under the weight of sign-wielders with lofty ambitions &ndash; all under the stony gazes of Secret Servicemen and the imposing presence of the executive residence.\n\nThe winner was humble in victory; the loser, gracious in defeat. There were no tears shed as Mitt Romney conceded &ndash; the Republican gave a short, pointed speech in which he thanked his running mate, wife and supporters for being &ldquo;the very best [he] could have imagined&rdquo;, and said he would pray the President could guide the nation successfully. Likewise, Obama thanked his supporters (quipping that he would have to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; long voting lines) and acknowledged the &ldquo;hard-fought campaign&rdquo; helmed by Romney and running mate Paul Ryan. He also took the opportunity to reconnect with some of the rhetoric which won him the hearts and minds of the public back in 2008. He stated that he had &ldquo;never felt more hopeful about America&rdquo;, and expressed aspirations to move past the crippling partisan politics of Washington towards a co-operative, all-inclusive future where everyone has a fair shot at the American dream &ndash; a level playing field where &ldquo;it doesn't matter whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled, gay or straight, you can make it [..] if you're willing to try.&rdquo;\n\nToday, as the elation lingers on through DC&rsquo;s collective hangover, hopes for Obama&rsquo;s second term certainly are high. The President promised much on the campaign trail and, although the Democrats retained control of the Senate last night, it will be a struggle to complete his vision with a Republican party as stubborn and uncompromising as holds the House of Representatives. But now is not the time for doubts and semantics, now is the time to breathe a sigh of relief and enjoy the spectacle as Fox News cries itself to sleep.\n\nAmerica has spoken, and only time will tell if it made the right call. I&rsquo;m in town for another few days, and if anything noteworthy happens I&rsquo;ll be sure to keep you posted. Still, I&rsquo;d like to thank you so much for joining me in Washington, DC as I rode the wave of Election 2012 just as it reached the shore; it&rsquo;s been a pleasure. Till 2016, I&rsquo;m D\u00f3nal F. Kennedy - keep it political.", "Imageurl": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/20121107-2336113.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13266", "Heading": "Election 2012: On-the-ground in DC part 2"}
