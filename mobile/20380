This election is based on a student vote with the majority of voters being ordinary members of the various sports clubs. Each club may put forward a representative and eight of these representatives will be elected to serve on the council. In total there were fifteen representatives from DUCAC&rsquo;s diverse range of clubs aiming for a place on the council.\r\n\r\nDUCAC is the organisation in charge of all the sporting bodies and clubs in Trinity. They are in charge of distributing grants amongst all the various clubs. As well as this part of their remit is to create an all-inclusive environment in relation to sport and recreation around the college for the benefit of the students. The council itself is there to represent the clubs within DUCAC insofar as they have a say in other matters such as the organisation of sporting activities on campus.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion after the first count, as something of a rarity, there was a request for a recount. The recount was delivered the following day, and there was a change in the standings as opposed to the original, miscalculated count. On the first count, Orla Fox representing the badminton club was the eighth and final representative. However after the recount Aideen Costello representing ultimate frisbee was awarded the place at the expense of Fox with a margin of 4 votes between the two; Costello polling 57 votes, to Fox&rsquo;s 53.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the polling, Jessica Jaques and Ian Hurley representing the Ladies&rsquo; Boat Club and Men&rsquo;s Boat Club were elected with 87 and 85 votes respectively. The rest of the representatives were Conal Campion (Harriers and Athletics), Lydia Todd (Netball), Alexandra Spain (Ladies Hockey), Aaron Rooney (Hockey) and Ian Beatty Orr (Rifle Club). The student interest in the executive committee was completed by Conor Traynor (Fencing) acting as vice-chairperson, Lucy O&rsquo;Donohue (Ladies Boat Club) as secretary and Kevin Migge (Harriers and Athletics) taking on the mantle of treasurer. Cyril Smith will serve as chairperson of the council for another year, a role he will hold until 2016.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/trinity11.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20380", "Heading": "Election confusion at DUCAC AGM"}
