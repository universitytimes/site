{"Body": "<strong>Ronan Richardson</strong>\n<em>President Correspondent</em>\n\nI waited patiently by my computer to &ldquo;Like&rdquo; the candidate profiles last night in order to gauge absolute initial stage views. By 9:23am already there was activity on the candidate pages. Thirty-six people had &ldquo;liked&rdquo; Tighe for President, Rory Dunne had garnered one hundred and thirty six &ldquo;likes&rdquo; whilst James Kelly, in this regard was in the lead with one hundred and thirty-six &ldquo;likes.&rdquo;\n\nMonday mornings in the Arts Block are never particularly busy and today was absolutely no different. However by 10am there was already a number of campaigners for James Kelly and Rory Dunne present with campaign literature and manifestos. Kelly's campaigners sporting black and yellow; Dunne's preference being the reserved but eye catching navy and white, whilst Tighe's went for the prominent red option.\n\nOn initial examination it was evident that there was more of a presence from both Kelly and Dunne campaigners as opposed to John Tighe campaigners. I was approached by a member of Kelly's team with campaign information and noticed that two of Dunne's people were already engaged with an individual. Where was John Tighe though? Strolling down the arts block I noticed him sitting on a couch alongside a supporter near the Davis theatre. Speaking with Tighe he did not seem to be fazed by the fact that his supporters were not jostling for positions in the main arts block foyer with the other campaigners. The other two presidential candidates were not seen here at this stage.\n\nI decided to leave the arts block and travel down to the Hamilton where supporters for both James Kelly and Rory Dunne could be found. Approaching James Kelly he said that in the early stages he had no negative feedback so far, and similarly Dunne confirmed that he had had little comment good, bad or indifferent. Both Dunne and Kelly had a strong presence in the Hamilton block -Dunne's presence here was particularly felt.\n\nBack in the arts block, campaigners from the Kelly and Dunne ranks were both clearly visible in conversation with students, both maximising footfall around the entrance doors. Whilst Kelly's campaigners were engaging with individual students in the arts foyer, the preference from the Dunne camp was to quickly hand out leaflets to as many students as possible. By 11:00am, there was still no visible John Tighe campaign team in the arts block.\n\nStudents today had hugely mixed views on the candidates. While the majority of them didn't know who the candidates were, those who did had more or less seemed to have chosen who they intended to vote for. Speaking with one lady, she felt that Kelly's manifesto was really comprehensive and well laid out. Moreover expressing, &ldquo;I liked his candidate profile.&rdquo; In contrast to this, another student working for Walker's campaign team felt that John Tighe &ldquo;had the most charisma,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;you know you can trust him.&rdquo;\n\nIn stark contrast to this, one member of the student population, Donal O'Cinn\u00e9ide, who was happy to be named and quoted felt that Tighe &ldquo;was unconvincing, idealistic and unprofessional. It's the same old stuff, Free Education for Everyone and the rest. We need micro, not macro policies.&rdquo; When the same individual was asked his opinions on Rory Dunne he felt (pardon the pun), &ldquo;Dunne gets things done.&rdquo; Cinn\u00e9ide also approved of his lucid speech and felt positive that both Kelly and Dunne were &ldquo;presidential material.&rdquo;\n\nIn terms of the candidate manifestos, aesthetically the majority of students I spoke to today seemed to think that James Kelly was the main winner here. Although he does not have any particularly evident campaign slogan, he does clearly illustrate contact information which cannot be found on the other two manifestos. It also includes his extensive CV of experience throughout his time in college.\n\nWhilst Kelly devotes a large amount of space to his policies including course integrated internships, promising change in the Students Union and expanding Student services etc.; Dunne incorporates his manifesto into a straightforward five point plan. Similarly to Kelly he feels strongly about internships, but also mentions the importance of DUCAC and his intention to increase the standards available to Trinity's sports-people. His controversial promise to donate 10% of his wage to the student hardship fund has received a mixed reception. While some view it as wholly populist, others feel it to be a practical gesture.\n\nIn contrast to the manifestos of both Kelly and Dunne, Tighe is seen to be more radical. Though harbouring numerous photographs of various types of felines and captions such as &ldquo;USI Y u no give yourselves pay cut during recession??&rdquo; Tighe does offer a solid stance on the important issue of fees and student contribution increases. As a member of FEE, Shell to Sea, and the Gaeltacht representative for D\u00e1il na n-\u00d3g, his background as an activist is extensive.\n\nInterestingly, on their Facebook pages, each candidate has tarred themselves with a different brush. James Kelly is mooted as a 'Public Figure', Tighe as a 'Politician', while Dunne has went for the more relaxed, 'Entertainer.' With Kelly's extensive participation in Trinity student life; Tighe's campaigning zeal, and Dunne's big personality- these characterisations are no doubt rather precise. With day one of the campaign over, we must wait with baited breath to see how the candidates develop upon the foundations that they hopefully established today.", "Imageurl": "8137", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8120", "Heading": "Ronan Richardson's Presidential Race Blog: Day 1"}
