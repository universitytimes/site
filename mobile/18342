{"Body": "<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Efforts are underway to call a referendum allowing TCDSU to campaign in favour of Seanad Reform, ahead of October&rsquo;s referendum on the abolition of the upper house.</span>\r\n\r\nFiachra \u00d3 Raghallaigh, a JS European Studies student, has been collecting signatures since last week and has now acquired the requisite 250 signatures to call a referendum. \u00d3 Raghallaigh is heavily involved in Future Matters, youth wing of the pro-reform Democracy Matters, and is also an active member of Fianna Fail and the Young European Federalists.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;It was in my capacity as Campaigns and Events Coordinator of Future Matters that I became aware that TCDSU&rsquo;s official position in favour of Seanad reform had recently expired, as I was hoping to invite them to partner with us in the campaign,&rdquo; \u00d3 Raghallaigh says.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;This is an issue that Trinity students should feel quite strongly about, given that our graduates have a track record of electing exemplary senators&hellip;We show what can be achieved when citizens make up the electorate &ndash; as opposed to county councillors.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nGiven the short time frame involved, the referendum must be held during the three weeks from Freshers&rsquo; Week until the referendum on 4th October if the Students&rsquo; Union is to participate in any campaigning for the &ldquo;No&rdquo; side. Aside from this, \u00d3 Raghallaigh states that if the referendum is rejected, the SU will have a mandate to continue lobbying for Seanad reform in future.\r\n\r\nJack Leahy, TCDSU Education Officer and the official in charge of all SU votes, must hold a long-term policy referendum no less than two, and no more than five weeks, after being presented with the 250 valid signatures. This means that Future Matters has had to present its petition before the weekend if the SU is to campaign under its new mandate during the week of the referendum.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130907-072336.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18342", "Heading": "Students Call for SU Referendum on Seanad Reform"}
