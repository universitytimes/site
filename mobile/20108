Thursday night saw the launch of the society&rsquo;s most eye-catching project yet, Ethnic Threads. This exciting new project sources and sells ethically produced clothing from Africa, which at the moment comes in the form of the artistic and vari-coloured hoodies featured in the photo above. These hoodies are made by the women of the Kenyan town of Mariakani, which is a &ldquo;corridor town&rdquo; or transit stop for truck drivers coming from the primary Kenyan port of Mombasa.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0At the launch, Project Leader Jack Danaher explained how the town&rsquo;s economic focus on these commuters affected the women of Mariakani; &ldquo;There is essentially no alternative industry and women in particular have enormous difficulty finding employment and as a result large numbers become sex workers servicing the truck drivers&rdquo;. This is made all the more tragic by the fact that truck drivers have on average twice the rate of HIV as the national average, which is itself alarmingly high.</p>\r\nEnactus has teamed up with local business and NGO&rsquo;s to help alleviate the plight of these women. Enactus&rsquo;s partners on the ground entice women away from the sex trade by offering training in textile manufacturing as well as agriculture. They go on to receive gainful employment in this industry, meaning they no longer feel obliged by economic deprivation to engage prostitution. Furthermore, extra profits go into education initiatives for children on the prevention HIV and AIDS in the area.\r\n\r\nArthur McKey, another senior Enactus member, spoke of the importance of sourcing finished products from Africa as opposed to mere raw materials as a means of breaking the cycle of poverty. The hoodies are made with Tanzanian cotton, which is then processed and designed in Mariakani, before being shipped up to us lucky customers here in Trinity.\r\n\r\nFor those of you interested in checking out these Ethnic Threads, the website is ethnicthreads.tictail.com where there are eight varieties of hoodies available for both men and women.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/DSC_0601.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20108", "Heading": "Enactus launch Ethnic Threads"}
