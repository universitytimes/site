His performance in DUFC's Freshers' Week victory over Cambridge was widely praised by College sports media, and he consistently made vital ground in his side's most recent clash with Bective last Friday night.\n\nSpeaking to <em>The University Times</em>, Lavelle hailed the honour as 'A great win for men who are wider than they are tall'.\n\n'Seriously though', he added, 'the older lads have just told me exactly what to do and babied me along, they made my job very easy altogether'.\n\n'A special mention to Rob Cruess Callaghan who started the season at 12; he thought me all the moves and stuff and has kept me on my toes'.\n\n<em>To nominate yourself or a member of your club for the feature - which will appear both on the website and in the broadsheet - send your suggestions to sports@universitytimes.ie.\u00a0</em>", "Imageurl": "5202", "Thumb_nail": "http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/IMG_36172", "ID": "5199", "Heading": "UT Sports Player of the Month: Patrick Lavelle"}
