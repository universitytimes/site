{"Body": "<strong>Vladimir Rakhmanin</strong>\n<em>Deputy Web Editor</em>\n\nLast\u00a0week's\u00a0Student Union Council saw representatives pass a motion to create a working group with mandate to investigate and recommend potential reforms within the Union of Students in Ireland and present its findings to a later Council in advance of USI national congress in the late spring.\n\nThe motion comes in the aftermath of the decision of Trinity students to remain affiliated to the Union of Students in Ireland in a referendum held along with elections for class representatives. The motion was proposed by Jack Leahy, Finance and Services Officer of the Union executive and campaign manager for the anti-disaffiliation side in the referendum.\n\nIn proposing the motion, he noted that despite the recent decision of Trinity Students to remain affiliated with the USI, there was still &lsquo;significant discontent&rsquo; felt with regards to the organisation. It would therefore be useful to create a working group &lsquo;to identify areas in which Trinity representatives can affect reform in USI fora&rsquo;. These findings will be presented to the Council during Hilary term. Mark O&rsquo;Meara, campaign manager for the pro-disaffiliation team, has on numerous occasions since the referendum expressed his doubt that reform will be enacted.\n\nAt the same meeting of Council, substantial motions were passed in relation to data protection and the delay in receiving timetables through the new online student information system.\n\nSU President Rory Dunne spoke on behalf of the data protection policy motion. He explained that because the Union holds so much personal information (mailing lists, for example), he considers it to be &lsquo;prudent and necessary&rsquo; to create a policy which reflected the seriousness with which the union holds and maintains such data. This policy is compliant under the Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nThe delay of online timetables was a recurring topic during the Council &ndash; Dan Ferrick, Education Officer, mentioned the unfortunate situation in his Sabbatical Report. Ferrick said that the delay was a &lsquo;huge problem&rsquo;, and mentioned the many late night phone calls involved in trying to get the system back on track. Despite the setbacks, he also stated that fixed timetables were being worked on &ndash; this means that, for instance, a Junior Freshman will be able to see his or her fourth year timetable. He also noted that the system is currently functioning without experiencing any major problems.\n\nIn terms of the actual motion, Rory Dunne spoke of the &lsquo;poor management&rsquo; involved &ndash; he also mentioned the fact that Trinity was given one year to implement this system, as opposed to the three year time period that is standard for the industry. Despite the fact that most of the timetables were already determined over the summer, it took a very long time to migrate the data from the old systems to the new ones. These delays essentially meant that &lsquo;students were testers&rsquo; for the new system &ndash; he encouraged everyone to vote for this motion to make sure these events would not occur again.", "Imageurl": "<strong>Vladimir Rakhmanin</strong>\n<em>Deputy Web Editor</em>\n\nLast\u00a0week's\u00a0Student Union Council saw representatives pass a motion to create a working group with mandate to investigate and recommend potential reforms within the Union of Students in Ireland and present its findings to a later Council in advance of USI national congress in the late spring.\n\nThe motion comes in the aftermath of the decision of Trinity students to remain affiliated to the Union of Students in Ireland in a referendum held along with elections for class representatives.
