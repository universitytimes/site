The date on the ticket reads 20th April 2012[/caption]\n\n<strong>Louise Duffy</strong> | News staff\n\nAt about 3 o&rsquo;clock today (Monday, 18th February), Trinity Ents posted a Facebook status warning of an unofficial Trinity Ball page that has appeared on Facebook. Ents warns that &ldquo;any competitions mentioned or information given is unsanctioned and in some cases may be false.&rdquo;\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The page, which carries the URL </span><a style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/dtwos.nightclub\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/dtwos.nightclub</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">, appears to have previously been affiliated to the D2 nightclub on Harcourt st. Comments of more than a day old concern lost coats and phones at the nightclub, and do not make reference to Trinity Ball. Posts after this relate to the announcement of Trinity Ball acts and the Trinity Ball Spotify playlist. The page has almost 1,700 friends, but appears to have lost a number of friends since the Ents status. The page purports to have a Trinity Ball ticket to give away, saying that those who add the page and like and share their status will be eligible to win. The status has been very widely shared.\u00a0</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The issue appears to have first been brought to the attention of the Ents officer when former SU president Ryan Bartlett posted a Facebook status commenting, &ldquo;Amazing how many people are adding this page called Trinity Ball without looking at the URL&hellip;I bet they wont actually get a ball ticket or give it away.&rdquo; Replies to the comment suggested Facebook had been contacted about the matter and that screen shots had been taken of the page in case they would be necessary for legal reasons.\u00a0</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Since the Ents status, several people have left comments, both on the unofficial page and on their own Facebook pages, stating their anger at the nightclub. Some have speculated that D2 may have changed the identity of the page in order to gain more friends so that it will be able to more effectively market itself online.</span>", "Imageurl": "15007", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15005", "Heading": "The Trinity Ball Giveaway Scam?"}
