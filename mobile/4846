Win and we would top the table for the first time in our Rugby World Cup history. Lose and we&rsquo;d be out, riots would take place across the country and Declan Kidney&rsquo;s head would be found on a plate in Donnybrook.\n\nBut a 9-6 lead thanks to O&rsquo;Gara&rsquo;s boot at half time, and three beautiful tries in the second half from Keith Earls (2) and Brian O'Driscoll have pushed us into a quarter-final, a familiar opponent and a general state of euphoria.\n\nA tentative first half of penalty kicks and questionable referring got the match off what can only be described as a Six Nations-style start.\n\nWith the first points of the game coming off O&rsquo;Gara&rsquo;s boot seven minutes in, Irish nerves over the questionable place kicking of previous games were eased, at least temporarily.\u00a0Bergamasco slotted over an Italian penalty to bring the score level some three minutes later.\n\nAnother penalty apiece, from an Italian offside at the line-out and Irish collapsing of the ruck, once again kept the scores on an even key 21 minutes in.\n\nInitially penned as the contest area of the match, the scrum was a battle ground for the first half hour. But an injury to Italian talisman Martin Castrogiovanni \u00a0in the 31<sup>st</sup> minute weakened the\u00a0 pack considerably. The need to move players between tight head and loose head to adjust for sub Andrea lo Cicero upset the Italian game plan to no end. It would mean Mike Ross would have a considerable advantage in the scrum for the rest of the game. The Italian line out would falter too as a result.\n\nA few bizarre and deeply questionable decisions from referee Jonathan Kaplan served to deeply aggravate the Irish side as the match went on, and would continue into the second half.\n\nKaplan&rsquo;s decision making was, to put it simply, abhorrent. Off the ball fights, fouls, infringements , obstructions and even a possible case of (accidental?) gouging were all ignored by the South African ref. Pleas and concerns raised by O&rsquo;Driscoll as\u00a0 captain were brushed off. Deliberate attacks against Healy time and time again were seen as non-issues. His constant swearing was seen as an overreaction.\n\nA clear try for Tommy Bowe, set up by Sean O'Brien, was disallowed, initially for a knock on, then changed to a call of forward pass, then back to knock on. Neither of the calls was accurate. The &ldquo;knock-on&rdquo; was a juggling of the ball in hand by Bowe; clearly allowed within the scope of the laws.\n\nDespite this absurdity, O&rsquo;Gara served to deliver the points again just before half time, giving us a 9-6 lead going into the second half.\n\nAnd what a second half it was.\n\nThe first try of the match materialised in the 47<sup>th</sup> minute, after a break through the Italian defence by Bowe, a deft inside pass to BOD and a touchdown beneath the posts.\n\nBirthday boy Earls earned his own try five minutes later, created by centre break from D&rsquo;arcy, a string of off the training ground passes, tackle dodging and the seer strength and force of Stephen Ferris.\u00a0 24-6 in the 54<sup>th</sup> minute and it appeared as though Ireland had it won.\n\nAnother opportunity in a near try from Kearney was declared held up by the TMO just minutues later.\n\nSubstitutions began coming thick and fast. O&rsquo;Connell was replaced by Donnacha Ryan due to hamstring concerns, Best replaced by Cronin after a collarbone injury. Sexton on for O&rsquo;Gara soon followed.\n\nCue another questionable referee decision, once again relating to Tommy Bowe and a try. After an 80-90 metre kick and chase that could only have been orchestrated by a player with his football skills, a deliberate pull back and obstruction by two Italian players right on the try line denied him the ability to touch the ball down. Such professional fouls on the line should have warranted an immediate penalty try. It was denied by the TMO after considerable consultation.\n\nA second try for Earls was to see the Irish off in style after a break by replacement Trimble in the final minute.\u00a0 A difficult conversion by Sexton proved he once again has his kicking boots on and set the Full Time score at 36-6.\n\nIreland have finished top of the table, an outcome almost no one could have predicted. A quarter final against Wales next week has already been dubbed the match of the tournament. Warren Gatland is sure to start mouthing off any day now. But for now let&rsquo;s enjoy this small 'final victory and an ever improving, in-form Irish.", "Imageurl": "4847", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4846", "Heading": "Ireland into quarters after breaking down Italy"}
