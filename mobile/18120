{"Body": "<p>I watched the match on Facebook, because football bores the shit out of me. That was way better. Everyone was getting excited because the Irish team (I&rsquo;d refer to the team as &lsquo;us&rsquo; but we lost so I&rsquo;m gonna go with &lsquo;them&rsquo;) winning a match against a team that clearly had played this game before, and by all accounts, they were doing quite well.

It&rsquo;s clearly a fault in the football regulatory system that allows hundreds of people to see (even whilst drunk) that a foul was committed, but because looking at a camera is considered blasphemous by the football authorities the &lsquo;ref&rsquo; can&rsquo;t do anything. It&rsquo;s not Henry&rsquo;s fault that football is fundamentally flawed, imagine if Roy Keane got away with a handball and scored a goal that would&rsquo;ve won them the match but then pointed out to the referee that he made a mistake and in the interest of fairness and good sportsmanship he couldn&rsquo;t allow the goal to be counted. He&rsquo;d be lynched. Some of the stuff on Facebook is a bit unnecessary though.</p>\n<p>Like all other football players, Henry has two arms which, if you spend most of your time focusing on your feet, flail about wildly. They&rsquo;re on a ball and socket joint for heaven&rsquo;s sake! I&rsquo;m assuming seeing as he beat Ireland, I&rsquo;d like to think Henry is at least &lsquo;quite good&rsquo; at football, and you&rsquo;d imagine players of a high calibre would not intentionally cheat at the job, whilst being watching on television. Unless football is either not really that hard to be good at, or the sport of bastards. It was probably a very silly impulse that he wouldn&rsquo;t have indulged had he more than a microsecond to decide, get over it. C&rsquo;mon like, Facebook groups called &ldquo;I Hate Thierry Henry The Cheating French Frog&ldquo; is just racism.</p>\n<p>Fair enough, the team did get screwed over but if the rules for governing a football match were abided by there are no real grounds for an appeal. As Henry himself said, &ldquo;I will be honest, it was a handball. But I&rsquo;m not the ref. I played it, the ref allowed it. That&rsquo;s a question you should ask him,&rdquo; &nbsp;he said. In football the referee&rsquo;s decision stands. If you don&rsquo;t like it, take up Ultimate Frisbee or something. They&rsquo;ve got a method of self-governing which means there is no ref, and it promotes good sportsmanship. It&rsquo;s still a stupid sport, but not much more than any other sport.

First of all, I had something to write my column about. Otherwise you&rsquo;d probably be reading about me urinating on tiny goalposts or something. Don&rsquo;t worry, that&rsquo;ll almost definitely be in the next issue. The price of French wine has dropped, which I am very happy about. Hot damn cheap French wine makes me very happy indeed.
