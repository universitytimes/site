It was no different here, with the Argentinians, so quickly written off \u00a0by the English and the media at large, doing serious damage to the English psyche.\n\nA physical game from the offset, with both teams playing the grunt work rugby they&rsquo;re so comfortable with, the game was to be one of stops, starts and penalties. And penalties. \u00a0And penalties. You have been warned.\n\nThe Pumas were to dominate the first half of the match. An Argentinian line out four minutes in was the first real opportunity, but alas it was not to be thanks to English offside, and Sheridan&rsquo;s digging in the rook. Out-half Felipe Contepomi slotted one through the sticks for a penalty at 7min.\n\nAnother penalty against England, making it 3 in two minutes, set the tone for the match, with indiscipline running amuck and referee Bryce Lawrence earning the ire of the captains for their sides' obvious infringements.\n\nA high tackle from Argentinian Rodrigo Roncero gave England their levelling opportunity at last, with Jonny Wilkinson forcing a difficult kick through the posts 11min in.\n\nTrue to form, the English were penalised at the breakdown and Comteponi&rsquo;s opportunity to take the lead was \u00a0lost by their third missed kick from distance. But Martin Rodrigez at last gave the Argentinians the lead they deserved with yet another penalty.\n\nA break by Foden 23 minutes in was the only real glimpse of what the 2003 world champions could do in the first half; a big tackle from Contempomi on Armitage served to save conceding a try. The number 10 however, knocked himself out of the game in the process. Argentina had lost their captain and number one kicker. Subsitute Marcelli replaced him and a big reshuffling of the Argentinian side ensued.\n\nA collapsed scrum gave the English yet another opportunity to draw level, but to the shock of the entire stadium, the mercurial Wilkinson missed a gifted penalty.\n\nA repeated infringement in the break down had Lawrence reaching for yellow after one too many penalties from England and sent the wonderfully bearded prop Dan Cole to the sin bin.\n\nYet another Argentinian player, Stade Francais centre Gonzalo Tiesi, was put out of action with a serious knee injury after coming into contact with Courtney \u00a0Lawes in the air just before halftime.\n\nNot one minute into the second half and another penalty was awarded, this time against the Pumas. Undeterred, the Argentinians attacked the English defence, creating opportunities and exploiting the \u00a0holes. Penalty number a zillion against England, and Rodriguez stretched his team's lead to 3-9.\n\nWilkinson&rsquo;s second miss of the game soon after served as an omen for the rest of the match. Martin Johnson's go-to game plan of forwards pushing through setting a platform for the veteran's kicking was crumbling. \u00a0Had Rodriguez converted all of the penalties gifted to the Pumas, they would have had a double digit lead; Contepomi&rsquo;s boot was sorely missed.\n\nANOTHER penalty, this time to England and Johnny missed his third kick in a row. Jaws could be heard dropping the world over.\n\nThe penalties kept coming against the English in the breakdown, Nick Easter and Cole being just two of the many main offenders. Argentinian control of the match continued, and a more able side would have converted the kicks and exploited the try opportunities better. The injuries inflicted in the first half were clearly taking their toll.\n<div>This didn&rsquo;t deter the thousands of Argentinians who made the journey to New Zealand. They \u00a0could be heard jeering English players as their game unravelled, set piece by set piece, with school boy mistakes creeping in by the 60 minute mark.</div>\nThe game, already broken, turned scrappy.\n\nJohnny Wilkinson missed yet another kick in the 64th minute - four in a row at this point. There are no words to describe this kind of implosion.\n\nThen, out of nothing, an English try emerged from a ruck, \u00a0fast ball and replacement scrum half Ben Youngs, cutting through a wide gap in the center. Wilkinson at last converted a kick into points, albeit a sitter right in front of the posts. It hardly restored confidence. A lead at last, 10-9. The introduction of Youngs proved to injuect the momentum needed.\n\nThe English game was at last awake. It only took 68 minutes.\n\nA penalty following the scrum, missed again by Wilkinson, had pigs flying worldwide, and showed that there are still issues in the English game. \u00a0The Argentinian scrum came under attack, another penalty taken by a concerned looking Johnny, was slotted at last between the posts, stretching the lead out 13-9 in the 75th minute.\n\nAnother try opportunity had Armitage pushed just into touch within millimetres of the try line. A line break from deep by Bosch had Argentina battling back in the last minute within their own half, forcing their way into the other half and overcoming England's scramble defense. A line out on the 80th minute to Argentina, turned into a ruck and surprise surprise, an English penalty and full time.\n<div>Argentina will no doubt consider themselves unlucky to not have had a penalty in the last minute when the Pumas chaser was felled by Delon Armitage, but Lawrence was unconcerned by appeals and blew for full-time.</div>\n<div>The English managed to eke out a win at last, perhaps undeservedly, and a result that would have been so different if not for Argentina losing their choice kicker. A painful game to watch, both sides will be feeling the effects of this match well into their next test, both physically and psychologically. For the Argies: the possible loss of key players and a disheartening defeat. The English: the wrath of an undoubtedly furious Johnson, questions over performance, and worries over whether or not Wilkinson has indeed been replaced by a meer average human being.</div>", "Imageurl": "4129", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4128", "Heading": "Late Youngs score saves dominated England"}
