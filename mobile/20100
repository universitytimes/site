{"Body": "<strong>Paul Behan</strong> | Contributing Writer\r\n\r\nIn attempting to convey my experience of Paddington Bear by Brian Donnelly &amp; Martha Fitzgerald I&rsquo;m going to ask you to do something for me. Imagine a box. The box is on a table in front of you. It looks cute on the outside and you&rsquo;re like moderately excited to open that box. You are not prepared for what you find inside. It&rsquo;s warm and fuzzy and it&rsquo;ll make you laugh.\r\n\r\nYou fall in, head first, led only by a song. A song that transports you back to a moment in childhood. It&rsquo;s an intangible feeling, like Mary Poppins, honey and sitting by the fire in your pyjamas all combined. Your eyes capture the stage in one moment, it&rsquo;s Bedknobs &amp; Broomsticks on steroids. The directors bombard you with cute, warm nostalgia and you can&rsquo;t help but feel the glow.\r\n<blockquote>The directors bombard you with cute, warm nostalgia and you can&rsquo;t help but feel the glow.</blockquote>\r\nThe lid is closed on the world outside and we meet our cast. The actors tease out the story of a na\u010fve bear who loves marmalade sandwiches. They do so well. A solid performance all round with Will Johnston and Molly Manister being exceptionally British and exceptionally enjoyable as the parents. Johnston in particular seems completely at home in his role. Our hero Tymora Freeman-Stannett shines and Austin Kottkamp was a comedic stand out in what was a hilarious piece.\r\n\r\nIt&rsquo;s a short and simple play. It&rsquo;s not perfect. Unsurprisingly Paddington doesn&rsquo;t make you think or challenge you. Characters don&rsquo;t convey the human experience or touch upon the doubt and conflict within us all. It doesn&rsquo;t try to. Fitzgerald &amp; Donnelly give themselves the burden of telling us the story of a little lost bear and do so in the most perfectly charming way.\r\n\r\nWhen you step outside, back into reality, you&rsquo;ll feel a pang for tea, crumpets and parcels with ribbon.\r\n\r\nIn five words: beautiful moment for your day.\r\n\r\n<em>Paddington Bear runs until Friday at 1pm in Players Theatre.</em>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/paddy-b.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20100", "Heading": "First Show of the Year"}
