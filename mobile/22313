{"Body": "<strong style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Aisling Curtis</strong><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"> | Staff Writer</span>\r\n\r\nThe Union of Students in Ireland (USI) has announced its decision to withdraw support from the Drinkaware.ie initiative, expressing concern over the campaign's links with the alcohol industry and, in\u00a0particular, its muted response regarding the popular Arthur's Day festival.\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">&ldquo;Encouraging students to drink responsibly is still an encouragement for students to drink &ndash;\u00a0regardless of how it's qualified.\"</blockquote>\r\nIn a letter to Fionnuala Sheehan, chief executive of the Moderate Enjoyment of Alcohol (MEAS)\u00a0group behind Drinkaware.ie, USI stated that it would \"not be working with Drinkaware in the future&rdquo;. The\u00a0decision was made following a motion passed at USI's National Council in November.\r\n\r\nJoe O'Connor, President of USI, cited &ldquo;the continued promotion of the Arthur's Day festival by Diageo&rdquo; as\u00a0one of the primary catalysts for the move. Furthermore, the campaign's manifesto regarding responsible\u00a0drinking is at odds with USI's aims to &ldquo;tackle the enormous alcohol abuse&rdquo; prevalent in Ireland. O'Connor\u00a0stated that &ldquo;encouraging students to drink responsibly is still an encouragement for students to drink &ndash;\u00a0regardless of how it's qualified&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nDrinkaware.ie was established in 2006 by MEAS, and is funded by drinks-industry bodies such as Diageo,\u00a0the producers of Guinness and promoters of the Arthur's Day festival, and other alcoholic products. It is behind a number of campaigns to promote\u00a0more responsible drinking attitudes among Irish young people.\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">MEAS aims to &ldquo;challenge and change some of the harmful cultural ways in which Irish people have, for\u00a0generations, used alcohol&rdquo;.</blockquote>\r\nIn a response to USI's announcement, Ms. Sheehan claimed that Drinkaware.ie is an &ldquo;alcohol social\u00a0responsibility organisation&rdquo;, and is not campaigning for alcohol prohibition. The campaign's target\u00a0audience consists of 18-24 year-olds, 87% of whom drink. Ms. Sheehan stated that extensive research\u00a0proved that a &ldquo;do not drink&rdquo; approach is ineffective to target irresponsible drinking, and that MEAS\u00a0simply aims to &ldquo;challenge and change some of the harmful cultural ways in which Irish people have, for\u00a0generations, used alcohol&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nThe country's main counselling organisation for victims of rape and sexual assault , the Rape Crisis\u00a0Network of Ireland (RCNI), issued a statement following USI's announcement, supporting the decision to\u00a0cut all ties with Drinkaware. RCNI stated that, according to a 2009 report, 77% of individuals suspected of\u00a0rape were found to have consumed alcohol prior to the offence. The promotion of alcohol consumption\u00a0by Drinkaware is considered by RCNI to constitute a normalising influence which strongly targets young\u00a0people.\r\n\r\nMs. Neary further said that USI's leadership in this area is &ldquo;vital&rdquo;, given the resources available to the\u00a0drinks industry for resisting social change. Joe O'Connor stated that USI intends to &ldquo;develop a student\u00a0alcohol awareness campaign&rdquo; separately of MEAS, and in future endeavours will work only with bodies that are\u00a0not funded by a &ldquo;self-regulating drinks industry&rdquo;.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Hailo.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22313", "Heading": "USI Withdraws Support from Drinkaware Campaign"}
