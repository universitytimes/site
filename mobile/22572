The aim of the society is to provide a network of support for students with children, to increase the visibility of student parents and their needs within the college community and to support the further integration of student parents into all areas of college life.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The society is a first step in making us more visible as a group&rdquo; within the college.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The social aspect of the society is particularly important as student parents will have opportunities to take part in extracurricular events, &ldquo;something we are often excluded from due to family commitments&rdquo; according to Nicole Jagusch, a mature student of Sociology and Social Policy and Chairperson of the Society.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ms Jagusch, a student parent herself, is particularly concerned with raising awareness of the barriers facing parents in third-level education and she comments that &ldquo;the society is a first step in making us more visible as a group&rdquo; within the college. She emphasises the importance of making Trinity more accessible to people from backgrounds which differ from that of the traditional student body.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Ms Jagusch was a central figure in the development of the Student Parents Society. She secured funding for an Equality Fund Project (2011-12) to conduct research into the experiences of student parents in Trinity. A group was then established to develop a student-parent policy and two successful welcome events for student parents and their families were held in October 2012 and September 2013. The Student Parents Society developed from this Equality Fund group.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There has been a noticeable increase in the number of non-traditional students entering higher education.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The society is particularly relevant given the growing diversity of the student body in Trinity. There has been a noticeable increase in the number of non-traditional students entering higher education. According to research conducted by PhD student parent and treasurer of the Student Parents Society, Mark Kearns, there have been a growing number of people returning to education at a later stage in their lives. This has resulted in an increase in the number of third-level students who are also parents.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For many mature students, the difficulties of re-entering education after several years are coupled with the issue of balancing college life and external responsibilities. According to Ms Jagusch, the first few months for mature students with children can be particularly difficult as many face financial concerns and the issue of balancing college classes and coursework with parental responsibilities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While student parents are a diverse group, most hold the same desire as traditional students to partake in the full college experience; however they &ldquo;are inevitably constrained by the competing demands on their time and resources,&rdquo; according to Mark Kearns. He suggests that some of the issues facing student parents may be alleviated when significant others, such as the students&rsquo; children and/or partners, also feel part of the college experience. The society hopes to address this by organising family events on the college campus.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The society will provide &ldquo;particular support, education, as well as networking and social events that are especially geared to their needs&rdquo;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This may help some of the problems for student parents, as well as giving their children some experience of third-level institutions. Lynn Ruane, a Trinity Access Programme (TAP) student with two daughters, hopes that the introduction of more family-friendly events and services in Trinity will give these children a greater understanding of college life and encourage them to pursue a third-level education.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kearns&rsquo; research indicates the need for student parents to be able to access &ldquo;particular support, education, as well as networking and social events that are especially geared to their needs&rdquo; and the society is particularly committed to addressing these areas.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The granting of society status to the Student Parents Group is recognition of the growing diversity of the student body and the variety of student needs within Trinity. The Student Parents Society sees it as an encouraging step in the promotion of diversity and equality in the college community.</p>\r\nThe society plans to organise family-friendly events for both undergraduate and postgraduate student parents and their children, as well as hosting talks and workshops on issues such as balancing family commitments with education and work. The next event for student parents and children is on Saturday, 14 December.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/student-parents-welcome-event.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22572", "Heading": "TCD Student Parents Group Granted Society Status"}
