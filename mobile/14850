One day I'm putting up the posters the next day my face is on them, my romanticisms and insights into the college I love are being transmitted onto 10,000 screens worldwide. Yet I found my heart yearning for the grass roots role of Posterboy that I so cherished, working at the beating heart of the Students Union. I've been disgusted with some of the poster arrangements\u00a0I've\u00a0witnessed this week and feel my replacement's work has been an insult to my artistic profession.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">I've learned much of the workings of Trinity in my short candidate-ship. The administrative and journalistic factions of this college are far less willing to accept a bribe than I was led to believe whilst my constructing my original manifesto. Also, although having commenced preliminary discussions with the Physics department, a few of their fundamental laws proved to be stumbling blocks in the work towards a 36 hour library.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">All in all I am grateful for all the support I received during the past few weeks, and I assure you none of it would be possible without the hard work, quick wit and naked bodies of my campaign team. I'd also like to thank Mike Basset, Rudyard Kipling, Emmet Kirwin and of course all of you; the viewing and 'liking' students of Trinity.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It is my only hope that next year's Entertainments Officer can run with some of my more viable policies, and it is my intention to keep them updated with a few of my personal\u00a0favourites\u00a0for 'Shteal of the Week'; I'm still working on how to steal a burrito #burritowars.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">I would like to take this opportunity to endorse Sean Reynolds for the position, his experience and ideas make him the only man for the job.\u00a0</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Just shmayin,</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Shmeesh.</span>", "Imageurl": "14851", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14850", "Heading": "Shmeesh Bows Out of Ents Race, Endorses Opponent"}
