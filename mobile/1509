{"Body": "Fionn Fitzpatrick-\n\nWith just four days left until the full line-up for the Trinity Ball 2011 is announced, here&rsquo;s a few (shot-in-the-dark) predictions as to who we might expect!&mdash;A special shout-out to Trinity&rsquo;s own Madhouse Djs for assisting in the selection!\nIf you haven&rsquo;t already, be sure to see Laura Morley&rsquo;s blog on the acts already announced <a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=1494\">right here, right now&hellip;</a>\n\n1) <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tinie Tempah</span></strong>\n\nA reasonably realistic prediction this one. Certainly the break-out act of 2010, Tinie would prove a massively popular addition to this year&rsquo;s line-up. Having already played the Other Stage in 2010, and boasting two number one singles with &lsquo;Pass Out&rsquo; and &lsquo;Written in the Stars&rsquo;, you wouldn&rsquo;t rule him out to be Genockey&rsquo;s hidden-Ace for the Main Stage in April. He&rsquo;d certainly bring the stars out&hellip;and the women&hellip;and the&hellip;you get it.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LCH1AsUydSc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n2) <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Professor Green</span></strong>\n\nWhile possibly not yet a contender for a premium slot on the Main Stage, Professor Green would be a welcome addition to the Trinity Ball 2011. Building a reputation for impassioned live performances, and with certified-hits like &lsquo;I Need You Tonight&rsquo; in his arsenal, any sceptics would soon be converted to his unique brand of British rap. A quick look at his tour schedule sees April 8<sup>th</sup> free, followed by a gig in County Mayo, Castlebar&rsquo;s Royal Theatre and Event Centre on April 9<sup>th</sup>. Is that a sure indicator?\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3lVDOda4L9Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n3) <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Katy B and Magnetic Man</span></strong>\n\nAnother name that is strongly rumoured to make an appearance at this year&rsquo;s Trinity Ball, Katy B had a moderately successful 2010, with two top-10 hits from her debut album &lsquo;On a Mission&rsquo;. However, it was Magnetic Man&rsquo;s eponymous debut album (which Katy B appeared on) that was tipped to be a big game-changer in 2010. While it didn&rsquo;t have the mainstream impact some thought it would, Magnetic Man&rsquo;s dubstep, electronic sound would appeal to a large sector of Trinity students.\nAnother possibility would be DJ sets from Magnetic Man&rsquo;s individual members Skream and Benga.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/93AU5IkvDPY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n4) <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Bell X1</span></strong>\n\nIt might seem optimistic, but there&rsquo;s no reason we should rule out Bell X1 making a headlining appearance at this year&rsquo;s Trinity Ball. Set to release their fifth album &lsquo;Bloodless Coup&rsquo; on April 12, Bell X1 might just see the benefit in promoting new material for a couple of thousand young, drunken, eager, appreciative Irish fans. Who doesn&rsquo;t love Bell X1 really? Even the hippest of rolly-smoking, vinyl-enthusiast, snooker-cue shoe hipsters would have to smile at the thought of dancing around brainlessly to &lsquo;Flame&rsquo;!\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/e6gIdA7m4uQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n5) <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Madhouse Djs\n\n</span></strong>The O&rsquo;Sullivan brothers have denied all rumours of them making an appearance at this year&rsquo;s event. However, that hasn&rsquo;t stopped this reporter second-guessing their bluff! Having played a long list of Trinity events this year including the Players Ball, Les Deux Alpes and the massively successful BESS Ball, is it time for them to step up to the dream gig? Only Genockey knows the answer!\nIn the meantime, check out their facebook page where you&rsquo;ll find their essential monthly mixtapes.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Madhouse-Djs/89538176463?ref=ts\">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Madhouse-Djs/89538176463?ref=ts</a>\n\nSo, there you have it!
