As a result of this, I feel that students were not granted the opportunity to hear the full case for continuing membership of their national union.\n\nVoting is currently underway in DCU and NUI Maynooth. DCU, currently unaffiliated with USI are voting on whether to join the national organisation or remain independent of it while NUIM are holding a referendum on whether to remain affiliated. \u00a0Privately, USI are confident of securing victory in both referendums.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ents\u00a0referendum\u00a0fails to reach\u00a0quorum\u00a0</strong></p>\nA constitutional referendum to create the position of Entertainments Officer in the updated UCDSU \u00a0constitution has fallen. Despite the Yes side winning by a margin of 60% to 40%, the poll was deemed invalid as the total number of valid votes cast was eleven short of the 2747 required to each\u00a0quorum.\n\nUCD students voted last March to adopt a new constitution that replaced the position of Ents Officer with a professional on a three-year contract.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">More to follow.</em></p>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Additional reporting by Owen Bennett</em>", "Imageurl": "15139", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15138", "Heading": "UCD Students Vote to Disaffiliate from USI"}
