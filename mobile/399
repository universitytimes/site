{"Body": "<p>Students protested last week in College Green regarding the proposal by certain Dublin businesses to abandon the bus gate, despite a remarkable reduction in bus journey times and a huge increase in the number of cyclists.</p>\n<p>Dublin City Council has been under pressure recently from certain businesses as they claim business has fallen by 30 per cent since the public transport priority measure was introduced on July 27th and that late-night retailing on Thursdays has been particularly hit because car-borne shoppers find access to the city centre more difficult. <br />The bus corridor, from which cars are excluded from 7am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm, Monday to Friday, is the subject of a High Court action against the council by 12 plaintiffs, including Brown Thomas, Louis Copeland, Q-Park and other multistorey car-park operators.</p>\n<p>Many Trinity students attended this protest to mark their indignation at the abandonment proposal. The protest, organised by Students&rsquo; Union Environmental and Ethical Trading Officer Barra Roantree, has been quite successful, with both Noel Dempsay and John Gormley opposing the lifting of the Bus Gate.</p>\n<p>The Bus Gate has seen Dublin city centre become much less congested and much cleaner. The bus corridor at College Green was initiated by Dublin City Council in September 2009 to reduce commuting times for bus users, cyclists, drivers and reduce congestion. It has been remarkably successful at achieving these aims, decreasing the maximum peak journey time from Parnell Square to Nassau Street from 40 minutes to just 10.</p>\n<p>Cyclist traffic along O&rsquo;Connell street has increased 64% since the bus gate started while average speed in the city centre has more then doubled during hours of operation from 5km/hr to 13km/hr. The fact that footfall along College Green has increased by 6% should in fact be seen as good for local businesses.<br />A rally was organised yesterday at City Hall by Trinity students to coincide with the Dublin City Council meeting where the decision was to be taken on whether or not to curtail Bus Gate hours during the Christmas period. At time of print the decision had yet to be announced yet speculation was rife that councillors would rule in favour of it.</p>\n<p>Green Party TD Ciaran Cuffe hoped the council would &ldquo;hold firm&rdquo; rather than ditch the bus gate for a period, while the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport described the move as &ldquo;shortsighted in the extreme&rdquo;.</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>Students protested last week in College Green regarding the proposal by certain Dublin businesses to abandon the bus gate, despite a remarkable reduction in bus journey times and a huge increase in the number of cyclists.</p>\n<p>Dublin City Council has been under pressure recently from certain businesses as they claim business has fallen by 30 per cent since the public transport priority measure was introduced on July 27th and that late-night retailing on Thursdays has been particularly hit because car-borne shoppers find access to the city centre more difficult. <br />The bus corridor, from which cars are excluded from 7am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm, Monday to Friday, is the subject of a High Court action against the council by 12 plaintiffs, including Brown Thomas, Louis Copeland, Q-Park and other multistorey car-park operators.</p>\n<p>Many Trinity students attended this protest to mark their indignation at the abandonment proposal.
