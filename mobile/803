She also stated that there is &ldquo;absolutely no reason&rdquo; why a student with a pass in HL maths should gain an advantage when applying for a degree in Arts and Humanities.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Trigoub-Rotnem and Jen Fox, SU Education Officer, raised objections to Trinity&rsquo;s decision to offer the bonus points at three separate committee meetings. The Union highlighted an Irish University Association (IUA) survey from 2008 which showed 61% of HL maths students do not go on to study maths-related subjects. Trigoub-Rotnem said, &ldquo;This is a third-level solution to a second-level problem and attacks the symptom, not the disease.&rdquo; Jen Fox said the real problem was maths teaching, and that it should have been in Trinity&rsquo;s &ldquo;progressive nature&rdquo; to &ldquo;highlight the issue of second-level mathematics teaching as a major flaw in the Irish education system.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The IUA recently announced that NUI, UL, DCU, TCD, DIT and RCSI will each give an additional 25 leaving cert points to any Higher Level maths student with a grade above a D3.

Elizabeth Oldham, of the Irish Mathematics Teachers Association, argued that maths is crucial subject, where students learn logical, procedural and problem-solving skills.

She highlighted the fact a large number of students fail mathematics and hence fail what is a hugely important matriculation requirement for entry into third level in Ireland. Other requirements are passes in English and Irish, but students can receive spelling and grammar waivers, language exemptions and other supports for those subjects, while there are few such supports for dyscalculia. In any case, the rate of students who fail maths is much higher than the rate of students who fail English and Irish. Trinity, only as of this year, is the only college in Ireland that offers a maths waiver to students with dyscalculia.
