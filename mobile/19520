{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Professor Jim Lucey, director of St Patrick&rsquo;s Mental Health Services and professor of psychiatry at Trinity, has spoken out about the need to tackle mental health issues with particular emphasis on their capacity to affect physical health.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One startling statistic which he quotes is that one in five physical symptoms presented at a GP&rsquo;s office are related to mental health issues. Addressing stress-related mental health problems in particular, Lucey elucidated how this affects one&rsquo;s physical health:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The consequence of that in long-term distress is toxic for you in terms of your ability to function and relate, to lift your spirit, to react, and is also toxic in terms of your body.&rdquo;</p>\r\nThus patients coming to their GP with symptoms such as muscle aches, joint pains, headaches and chronic fatigue may well have undisclosed and unaddressed mental health issues and Professor Lucey is urging doctors around the country not to shy away from raising mental health as a possible cause of such symptoms.\r\n\r\nLucey also spoke of the relevance of mental health to those recovering from heart attacks, stating that a person who has a heart attack and is not depressed has a very good recovery rate, but &ldquo;if you have a heart attack and are depressed, you are four times more likely to succumb.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn response to these worrying statistics, Professor Lucey recommends a more holistic approach to treatment which views treating both the mental and physical roots of our ailments as part and parcel of a more comprehensive path to patient recovery and well-being.\r\n\r\nPhoto: The Irish Times", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/image3.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19520", "Heading": "Trinity Professor: Mind Over Matter Key to Physical Well-Being"}
