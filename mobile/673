{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>The eerie mist that descended over Donnybrook Stadium at the final whistle seemed to reflect the mood of a disconsolate Trinity side after having been soundly beaten in the 58th Colours Match. The night had begun with a great deal of expectancy around the stadium with Captain Johnny Iliff leading out the First IV in their redesigned kits looking a figure of concentration and determination. Trinity made the ideal start to the game going 3-0 up within minutes thanks to a penalty from Fly-half David Joyce. &nbsp;However, the complexion of the match was to change irreversibly in a manic four-minute period in which UCD scored two converted tries. The first of these came in somewhat fortunate fashion after a failed drop goal attempt bounced off the post and straight into the arms of Centre Andy Cummiskey who went over before the Trinity backs could react. From the resulting kick off the UCD Hooker, Conor Geoghegan the eventual man-of-the-match, made an impressive 50 yard run which split the Trinity defence wide open before eventually being tackled on the Trinity twenty-two. The ball was quickly recycled and a calculated cross-field kick left the Trinity defence badly exposed allowing Tom Fletcher in for his first try of the match.</p>\n<p>With the scoreboard reading 14-3 with barely seven minutes gone, the Trinity lads were visibly shell-shocked and they struggled to settle into the game. There were a few glimpses of silky passing between the backs but they seemed to lack the belief with the ball in hand and often resorted to kicking away possession needlessly. The only department in which they were enjoying any success was in the lineout, taking advantage of some poor throwing from UCD. Yet, the side from Belfield continued to keep the scoreboard ticking over, stretching their lead from a Niall Earls penalty. UCD Hooker Conor Geoghegan also continued to cause problems for Trinity, running some excellent lines and proving exceptionally difficult to take down.</p>\n<p>However, mid way through the first-half Trinity did manage to break through the solid UCD defence and score what would be their only try. It was made possible purely through the dogged persistence of Alan &lsquo;Dozey&rsquo; Mathews who evaded a number of tackles to go over in the far corner. While Trinity might have hoped that the try would re-energise their efforts, UCD coolly exerted their control on the game and extended their lead through a drop goal and then a penalty both from coming the boot of Fly-half Earls.</p>\n<p>It left the score at 23-8 at half time and it was to prove an insurmountable task for Trinity to overhaul. The second half was much less of a spectacle than the first with the damage having been inflicted in the opening ten minutes. At times the only real action seemed to emanate from the inebriated UCD rabble on the far terrace who threw rubber ducks onto the pitch and engaged in some quite &lsquo;hilarious&rsquo; chanting.</p>\n<p>On the field though, Trinity did string together some promising passages of play but were undone more often than not by carelessness. They came close to scoring a second try but were scuppered a few metres short of the line conceding a penalty at the crucial time. Much of the second half was characterised by handing errors from Trinity especially under the high ball with which they struggled the entire game.</p>\n<p>For all of Trinity&rsquo;s endeavours though they could not make up the deficit and UCD put the game firmly beyond their reach with a finely executed try from Niall Fletcher to leave the final score at 28-8.</p>\n<p>And so the Colours Cup will return to Belfield for another year after what amounted to a comprehensive victory. Furthermore, UCD have gained valuable league points to put them level with Trinity in the AIB Division 2 standings. In truth, Trinity never recovered from the opening brace of tries and thereafter were unable to get a foothold in the game. That being said, UCD went about their task with tremendous efficiency and held firm against any possible Trinity comeback. A disappointing night then for Trinity rugby but the players must now focus their efforts on finishing the season well and ensuring a solid league position.</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>The eerie mist that descended over Donnybrook Stadium at the final whistle seemed to reflect the mood of a disconsolate Trinity side after having been soundly beaten in the 58th Colours Match.
