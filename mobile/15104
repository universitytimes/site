Maynooth managed to stay in touch with pointed frees, but each one converted was matched by the unerring accuracy of Trinity College's Colm Coughlan.\n\nThe mild spring breeze with Maynooth in the first half was of no great assistance as Trinity went in to the half time break in the lead with the scores at Trinity 0-06 to 0-05 NUI Maynooth thanks to further points from Coughlan and the indefatigable Sutcliffe.\n\nAt the resumption Maynooth did not relent as they fought back to regain a foothold in the match with both teams swapping pointed frees. The early exchanges proved tit for tat until the game&rsquo;s defining moment. Trinity launched a long delivery to find full forward Andrew Dermody in space, his deft hand-pass deceiving the cover and finding Gleeson on an approaching arc. His shot, though reached by the outstretched hurley of the Maynooth goalkeeper could not be stopped on its path, and with Trinity adding the next two scores they seemed poised to claim a certain victory.\n\nHowever, the industrious Paul Coughlan at centre back fell afoul of the referee&rsquo;s notebook and saw the line for a second yellow card. Spurred on by their numerical advantage, wave after wave of Maynooth attack met with tough defence from Paul Breen and Eoin McCarney in the full back line. Further out the field Michael Doyle was working impressively in the half back line with help from midfield work horses Paul Halley and Oisin Daly, who were making minced meat of their opponents (presumably for the supermarket ready-meal shelves).\n\nThe final ten minutes were a tense affair, but a free from Coughlan settled the match and a late 21 yard free pointed from Maynooth was not enough to catch Trinity and the spoils were deservedly heading on the bus back to Dublin City Centre.\n\nTrinity have reached the final weekend for the 3<sup>rd</sup> year in a row and will hope for great support as they seek to bring home the Ryan Cup. <em>University Times</em> will have the report from the games, which will be concluded tomorrow.", "Imageurl": "<strong>Brian Dervan |</strong> <em>GAA Contributor</em>\n\nTrinity College 1-10 v 0-11 NUI Maynooth\n\nA goal mid-way through the second half from centre forward Colm Gleeson in Tuesday&rsquo;s Ryan Cup quarter final was the difference between Trinity Colleges&rsquo; senior hurlers and their NUI Maynooth hosts in a keenly fought battle.\n\nFourteen-man Trinity held their nerve to overcome a Maynooth second half come back to see themselves through to the semi-final weekend in GMIT this weekend where they will face Tralee IT.\n\nTrinity started the better with scores from play from wing forward Conor McDonnell and roaming corner forward Danny Sutcliffe.
