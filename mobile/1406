{"Body": "Thus far, the welfare race has not shown the excitement we have seen in the Presidential, Ents and Educa- tion races. Louisa Miller and Darren O&rsquo;Gorman have come in at first and second in the polls consistently, followed by Russell Bryce and Caroline Keating.\n\nThe first round of hustings was held on the steps of the dining hall where the three candidates spoke about their campaigns. Louisa cited her huge wealth of experience in social work and her qualifications as her strong point. Darren described his approachability and availability which he has proven through his work with the LGBT as auditor. Darren also claimed to have the most realistic and achievable goals in the long term. Russel Bryce, sold himself as the candidate with a difference. As a politics student, he explained to the crowd that political advocacy was necessary in this line of work and that the role of welfare officer needed to expand to fight unemployment for graduate students. There was a backlash this week , from Darrren O&rsquo;Gorman, against Russel&rsquo;s claim that the office of welfare was a political role. Rus- sel wants this office to stop being the same thing every year and for candidates to stop repeating the process; it should broaden its horizons in the recession-era Ireland. Darren refuted this argument saying the welfare officer should be concerned with the welfare of the students and that it was not purely a political office. Caroline Keating put the focus of her campaign on body image encompassing eating disorders with her speech at the hustings also.\n\nOn Tuesday, the candidates visited off campus locations like D&rsquo;Olier Street Nursing school. Louisa Miller sympathised with the student nurses who are now losing payment for their work on placement in James&rsquo; and Tallaght. Caroline Keating brought her campaign to James&rsquo;s. Darren O&rsquo;Gorman and Russel Bryce attended lecture addresses in an effort to promote their campaigns.\n\nWednesday was a big campaigning day for our candidates as they all visited James&rsquo; (again) as the nurses&rsquo; protest at the pay cuts took place. Russell remarked again how this shows the student body is becoming\nmore politically active and so needs a politically active welfare officer. Each candidate commented on the palpable sense of anger that they all felt while talking to the nurses. They all agree that the Welfare office is going to play a massive role in advising and liasing with current nursing students about their future careers. Darren O&rsquo;Gorman canvassed in Halls where he received a warm welcome.\n\nThursday was a &ldquo;brick wall day&rdquo; as Darren put it. Fatigue was setting in on all candidates and the lack of a stunt from any candidate meant that interest was transferred over to the now simmering Ents race.\n\nOn Friday tumbleweed could be seen rolling around the Arts Block as the place turned into a ghost town. Hannah Cogan, one of Darren&rsquo;s campaign managers, was not worried however as the week&rsquo;s canvass- ing had been highly successful. This was similar for Louisa Miller. Caroline Keating seemed to be content too. Here&rsquo;s hoping for the exciting stunts promised by some of the candidates on monday as all camps re-group and head for the home strait.\n\nGavin MacDermott", "Imageurl": "1434", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1406", "Heading": "Dull race for an important position"}
