While there are quite a few different spices, I do think they are worth the investment. Or, alternatively, you could cook this in a kitchen that already has all the necessary ingredients (Hi Mum!), freeze it and use it during the week. \u00a0As with all curries, they taste even better when they&rsquo;ve had some time to mellow so making it at the weekend works well.\n\nThis sauce is veggie friendly, gluten free and very versatile - you can add anything to it including vegetables such as cauliflower, chopped up potatoes or peas which work very well. Meats, too, like diced chicken or lamb are delicious!\n\nYou can cook it in a medium sized pan or wok with a lid on the hob. One word of warning, turmeric will stain anything it comes into contact with so avoid all things white.\n\nFor a mild curry, leave the chilli whole and remove from the sauce before serving. For medium heat, add one seeded and chopped chilli. And for hot hot hot, add two seeded chopped chillies. Cook enough rice to feed six (or four very hungry) people and serve with mango chutney.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong>\n<em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em>\n<em>2 onions, chopped</em>\n<em>2 garlic cloves, chopped</em>\n<em>1-2 green chillies, whole or seeded and chopped</em>\n<em>2 teaspoons garam masala</em>\n<em>2 teaspoons ground coriander</em>\n<em>1 teaspoon chilli powder</em>\n<em>\u02dd teaspoon ground turmeric</em>\n<em>60 gram coconut block, dissolved in 300ml vegetable stock</em>\n<em>1 tin chopped tomatoes</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Method:</em></strong>\n<em>- Heat the oil then soften onion, garlic, chillies and spices in the pan</em>\n<em>- Add coconut, stock and tomatoes</em>\n<em>- Cover and simmer for 30 minutes</em>\n<em>- Take out the chilli now if you&rsquo;re making a mild curry</em>\n<em>- Blend with a hand whisk if you have one, then empty the sauce out of the pan and leave to one side.</em>\n<em>- Cook up your vegetables and/or meat in the clean pan, then stir the curry sauce back in.</em>\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "12793", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Curry3", "ID": "12792", "Heading": "Kerry's Kitchen: Comforting Curry"}
