The decision was outlined in Budget 2014, announced earlier today by Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin.</span></p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">USI President Joe O&rsquo;Connor said:</span>\n<blockquote><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&ldquo;This budget marks a turning point. After four cuts to the maintenance grant in four consecutive budgets, the Government has accepted that struggling students and families can take no more.\"</span></blockquote>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&ldquo;Throughout our campaign we have highlighted the fact that education is a public investment, not public spending,\" he continued. \"The maintenance grant, meagre as it is, allows those who wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise have the opportunity to attend third-level, to earn a degree, to have improved career prospects and contribute to our economic recovery.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Further news that the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) has been retained and enhanced is &ldquo;an encouraging sign that the government is listening to what people have been pressing for, education that gets people back to work,&rdquo; said O&rsquo;Connor. \u00a0</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Moreover, the new budget reconfirms that the student contribution charge for third-level institutions will increase by &euro;250 to &euro;2,750 next year. However O'Connor has vowed to &ldquo;continue to campaign for this fee to be bench-marked against economic recovery and reduced to pre-crisis levels.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Vulnerable young people who are not in third-level education have faced a hit as there is to be a lower dole rate of &euro;100 per week for under-25's; critics of the government have labelled this a policy of forced emigration. Furthermore, the much-discussed Youth Guarantee has been granted &euro;14 million in the budget, widely regarded as being insufficient to provide work for the 53,800 officially unemployed youths in Ireland.</span>\r\n\r\nElsewhere in the budget, NAMA is to invest &euro;2 billion for the purchase of commercial property and fund the construction of 4500 homes; however O&rsquo;Connor has pointed out that the student accommodation crisis in Dublin and other areas such as Maynooth should also be addressed as part of NAMA developments.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Excise duties faced a predicted increase: a packet of twenty cigarettes and a pint of beer or cider will go up by 10 cent while a bottle of wine will increase by 50 cent. However there will be no increase in excise duties on petrol, heating, oil or gas.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">At the end of his speech Minister Noonan said the country was &ldquo;well along the recovery path and it is time for us as a nation to look forward to the future.&rdquo; However opponents have described the budget as anti-elderly, anti-women and anti-young people.</span>\n<em>Photo Credits: Benedict Shegog</em>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/benedict-shegog.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20441", "Heading": "Silver Lining for Students as Maintenance Grant Escapes Further Cuts"}
