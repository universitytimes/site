Just over ten years later the word google was added to the Oxford English Dictionary as a verb meaning, &ldquo;to use the Google search engine to find information on the Internet.&rdquo; This is just one example of how Google have time and again managed to change the world and the way we communicate. Their latest effort to do just this is certainly one of their most ambitious to date.</p>\n<p>Google Wave was announced in May with the modest goal of replacing email, instant messaging and most other tools we currently use to communicate online. Google describes their new product as a tool for &ldquo;real-time communication and collaboration&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>Users of Google Wave will be able to create and share &lsquo;waves&rsquo; with one or more of their friends. Waves are part-conversation, part-document and incredibly flexible. Depending on the way a wave is used it can function like a traditional email conversation, with parties replying to each other in their own time. Waves update in real-time though, so if two people have the same wave open at the same time they can use it like an instant message conversation. The same can be done if three people are using a wave or four people or five or &ndash; you get the idea.</p>\n<p>Waves can also be used to create collaborative documents, similar to the already existing Google Docs though with a few improvements, where users can edit each others&rsquo; work.

If you can get through the less-than-perfect presentational skills of Google&rsquo;s developers, you will realise that Wave has the potential to do exactly what they say it will: it could completely change the way that we communicate and interact.</p>\n<p>Google have good reason to want to create something to replace email. The email protocol used today was developed in 1982 for a very different Internet, one that didn&rsquo;t even have web pages. Over the last three decades the ways in which we communicate via the Internet have changed drastically yet we still use email, a communication method that is highly susceptible to spam and fraud.<br />On top of the basic functionality of Wave as described earlier, there are plenty of bells and whistles to attract the masses &ndash; a vital step in the process of replacing email. Web developers are able to write their own &lsquo;robots&rsquo; for Google Wave.</p>\n<p>These robots are little applications that can be added to waves to perform certain functions. Some robots already demonstrated with Wave include polls for Wave users to vote, Google Maps that can be inserted and collaboratively edited, and an automatic translator that can translate conversations between forty different languages in real time.</p>\n<p>Anyone with the skills can develop a new robot for Google Wave. Accounts were given to web developers this June and so far they have developed a plethora of widgets. Some of these independently developed applications include the Ribbit Conference Gadget, used to conduct real-time audio conference calls in a wave, LabPixies&rsquo; Sudoku Gadget, used to collaboratively solve Sudoku puzzles in a wave, and Mediawiki Wave, used to make edits to Wikipedia articles via waves. There are countless other uses for these robots, including having widely-used web applications such as Facebook and Twitter integrated with Google Wave.</p>\n<p>One of the most promising parts of Google Wave, and the part that guarantees its potential to usurp email, is that Wave is what is known as an open protocol.
