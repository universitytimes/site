{"Body": "Tommy Gavin, Deputy Editor\n\nIn a poll of 1,248 university students conducted in a collaborative effort by student media across the country, it has emerged that Labour have much greater support among students than among those polled for the Irish Times and the Independent. Students from TCD, UCD, DCU, UCC, UL and NUIG took part in the opinion poll, coordinated by UCD&rsquo;s <em>College Tribune </em>in association with <em>The</em> <em>University Times </em>and other student media outlets across the country.\n\nThe results from each individual college were weighted by dividing the number of students in each college by the total number polled, and multiplied by each result, so that colleges with comparatively larger student populations were represented accurately.\n\nIrish students on average prefer Eamon Gilmore to Enda Kenny, as the Labour leader is thought to be the best candidate for Taoiseach to 23% of Irish students, compared to Enda Kenny&rsquo;s 20%.\n\nMiche\u00e1l Martin polls much lower among students than the national average, with only 13% considering him to be the best candidate for Taoiseach, compared with 28% in a Sunday Independent/Millward Brown Lansdowne opinion poll. Fine Gael is still seen as the party in the lead with 34%, but is followed closely by Labour with 30%, with the next-highest polling party for first preference votes being miscellaneous independent candidates with 13%.\u00a0 Fianna F\u00e1il trails with 10%, beating only the Green Party, Sinn F\u00e9in and Other.\n\nThe poll also demonstrates a level of political attentiveness amongst students, with 73% saying they will be voting, of whom 24% are undecided, dispelling the myth of youth voter apathy.\n\nThe Green Party fared extremely poorly in the poll with 4% intending to vote for them, and only 3% of students think that John Gormley would be the most capable Taoiseach, as students have apparently come to see the Green Party as not being worthy of consideration following their inglorious time in government with Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nThis will no doubt cause some annoyance to the Greens, claiming that it was Paul Gogarty\u00a0 (who infamously quipped &ldquo;With all due respect, in the most unparliamentary language, fuck you Deputy Stagg&rdquo; during a debate in the D\u00e1il in 2009) that kept tuition fees off the table as chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science. If that was the case, it evidently is not enough for student voters.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in are also below national average figures when compared with students, as only 6% of those polled intend to vote for them, and a mere 4% think that Gerry Adams would be the best Taoiseach.\n\n14% thought that none of the candidates offered would be a desirable Taoiseach and 23% don&rsquo;t know.\n\nUSI President Gary Redmond said to <em>The University Times</em> that &ldquo;One thing that this poll shows is that voting intention for students is much higher for the Labour Party than in older generations.\n\nI would imagine that this is because the Labour Party have come out very strongly in favour of free fees, and indeed have said that they would reduce the Student Services Charge. This is obviously incredibly important to students and that&rsquo;s factoring in strongly in their voting intentions.&rdquo;\n\nHe blames the lack of support for Fianna F\u00e1il on their failure to deliver on student issues, commenting that &ldquo;with Fianna F\u00e1il at around 8% lower than in national polls, it&rsquo;s clear that students feel very strongly about what Fianna F\u00e1il have done in government. They cut student grants, raised the registration fee hugely and did nothing to tackle graduate unemployment.\n\n&ldquo;At the National Student Protest, we said that parties who failed to tackle these issues would pay the price at the ballot box, and it&rsquo;s clear that this is the case. Trinity and other Students&rsquo; Unions around the country have been registering students to vote for the last few months and parties that don&rsquo;t respect students&rsquo; needs will be punished come election day. Every opinion poll shows that students are more politicised than ever and that their voices will be heard in this election.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "1627", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18201", "Heading": "Fine Gael are students&#039; pick in all-Ireland campus survey"}
