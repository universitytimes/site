{"Body": "Hannah Vero\n\nI love clothes, I&rsquo;m practically obsessed with all things textile. I&rsquo;m certainly not saying that this aesthetic fixation of mine is healthy or beneficial, for either my sanity or my bank balance, but regardless, it is an obsession all of my own. I could spend all day wandering through stores and not even notice time pass by. I don&rsquo;t need to buy anything, but I like to put my favourite pieces together in the fitting rooms, standing back and appreciating my work. They don&rsquo;t have to be pieces that suit me, because I like to shop for other people too; it&rsquo;s my job. Department stores are like galleries to me; Brown Thomas representing the Louvre, Topshop being the Met. Grafton Street is a veritable catwalk as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. And as for our Trinity? Well for me, it&rsquo;s backstage at Fashion Week.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2134\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"200\" caption=\"Agyness Dean: innovator of the feminine-masculine look\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/595856_f260.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2134\" title=\"595856_f260\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/595856_f260-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nYet, even though I love dresses and skirts as much as the next gal, there&rsquo;s times when I would really like to be a boy. I know what your thinking, that this article just took a strange turn, or the above sentence is some sort of accidental expression of my inner monologue, and now any one who can access the internet knows that I have secret penis envy. That, my dear reader, is not the case.\n\nPenis envy, not so much, but I am plagued by total fashion envy. I feel that if I was attending any other college in this city, this envy probably wouldn&rsquo;t have embedded itself in my psyche. Even if I was to be in another block of my beloved campus this secret longing of mine wouldn&rsquo;t be so manifested in my mind! But no, I am in the arts block of these hallowed university grounds, easily, undoubtedly the most fashion-conscience branch of this college. It is without question that the boys of the arts block are the best dressed of us all. That&rsquo;s what I love about Trinity; our fashion intellect matches our academic prowess.\n\nThe boys of Trinity, namely those of the Arts Block, are making me reconsider by entire wardrobe. God damn, if I could look that good in skinny jeans, I would be a happy woman. The boys clothing inventory; skinny jeans, smart trousers, plaid shirts, blazers, bow ties (I&rsquo;ve noted this, you know who you are, it&rsquo;s fabulous), boots or neat leather shoes.\n\nEven stepping away from the block, the city centre is full of men who wear their business attire with such panache that I don&rsquo;t believe the inhabitants of this fair city have ever looked so suave. Women don&rsquo;t get to embrace the vigour of the suit, but nothing makes an impression quite like a crisp, well cut twinset. According to a dear man-friend of mine, the key to exam confidence is to &ldquo;suit up&rdquo;. He consistently, without fail, at every Junior Freshman exam, stated his mantra, over, and over&hellip; and over. Whilst I never took his advice, I did attempt a similar logic and donned a maxi-dress and a full face of make up for my Italian history exam; I tripped at least four times on my way to Gold Smith and channelled the aura of free-spirited flower child rather than that of a quick thinking, intellectual, power player.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2137\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"194\" caption=\"Leighton Meester rocking the pants suit\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Leighton+Meester+IFP+20th+Annual+Gotham+Independent+UwLSXOah7Srl.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2137\" title=\"Leighton+Meester+IFP+20th+Annual+Gotham+Independent+UwLSXOah7Srl\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Leighton+Meester+IFP+20th+Annual+Gotham+Independent+UwLSXOah7Srl-194x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"194\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nI love girly dresses, flower prints, high waisted shorts, knee highs (I am an avid knee-high collector), body-con skirts, maxi-dresses, hair accessories, costume jewellery, beachwear. I love it all. Yet from time to time I would like to wake up in the morning, don a smart business man inspired look, with a feminine twist of course, and feel the power of a well cut suit. Boys, oh boys, how you inspire me! I feel its time for an androgynous wardrobe re-vamp.\n\nLadies, venture forth, get shopping, inject a little testosterone into that closet of yours, and feel the energy of (in the words of the very talented Jessie J) doing it like a dude.\n\nThe Key Piece List:\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">1. White Shirt and Neat Blazer - Penney&rsquo;s has plenty of inexpensive work wear\n2. High Waisted Shorts or Trousers (if feeling daring, suspenders with high waisted shorts helps keep it sexy and feminine)\n3. Bow Ties and Braces - lots to be found for 12.00 euro or less in Georges St. Arcade.\n4. Panama Hats- Perfect for when the sun comes out, looks best with a black bow around it.\n5.
