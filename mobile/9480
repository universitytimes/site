It&rsquo;s here! Up early and into the bookies of Pearse Street to make my selections and prepare for the day ahead. I made out my Yankee first, which included Steps to Freedom, Sprinter Sacre, The Package and Hurricane fly. My other two bets were Sizing Australia and Hunt Ball both each way.\n\nI think it&rsquo;s fair to say that the bookies are extremely happy today after skinning most Irish punters in particular. In the first Steps to Freedom got a poor start and made serious progress coming up to the third last but faded away from the leaders to leave the 10/1 shot Cinders and Ashes and stayed on from the favourite Darlan who contested well. My first thought- accumulator &ldquo;defunked&rdquo;, long day ahead.\n\nSprinter Sacre ran a very impressive race in the second and won quite comfortably to settle the ship on the remaining treble, doubles and singles in the Yankee. Things started to look up when The Package in the next looked very much in contention jumping the last but landed a bit awkwardly and just couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the pace towards the post after losing his stride. He stayed on to achieve fourth and added to regaining some of my place money for the Yankee but things were looking grim.\n\nThe next race was most certainly one that left the bookies smirking and punters reeling. Hurricane fly was the &ldquo;banker&rdquo; for today but his run left the punters rocked. He was held up in mid field by his pilot Ruby Walsh and bowled along comfortably for the first half of the race. He pushed on into third place three out behind Overturn and the eventual winner Rock on Ruby (11/1). He was shaken up by Walsh and came within three lengths of the leading pair jumping the last but could make no impression. Cheltenham fell silent, the Irish, and most of all Willie Mullins, devastated.\n\nThe next race was the exciting Cross Country Chase, but needless to say I, and many others, were still feeling a little dejected. I had Sizing Australia in this one who got a decent start and had every chance jumping the second last. Unfortunately lacked the gas on the flat and only stayed on for fourth which gave me my money back plus shrapnel.\n\nI didn&rsquo;t get involved in the mares hurdle which saw Quevega run on impressively to win the race for the fourth time, which undoubtedly restores pride to the Closutton team. Gloomy and all as my situation was I managed to drag myself to watch the last race. I was beginning to get pessimistic and had little hope in my each way punt on Hunt Ball. As they jumped the third last I looked up and I saw the red cap and pale blue sleeves of my lad. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s jumping well&rdquo; muttered a learned Niall Collins to me, and with that he was in the lead coming to the last and stayed on to save the day. It&rsquo;s a funny game, but that&rsquo;s why I love it. It brings you back the next day. I was up a few quid for what was looking to be a disaster of a day!\n\nWe regroup and look to tomorrow&rsquo;s card for inspiration! Before we do, however, I would like to just say that I got a phone call just before the mare&rsquo;s race from Cheltenham. A good friend of mine attending the races told me that he saw some of Mullins&rsquo; horses today and he said that he thought they look a bit out of sorts. He suggested a bit of sickness but I can&rsquo;t confirm anything. I would say though that this man does know his horses and would take from it what you will.\n\nThe first race tomorrow is the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Diamond Jubilee National\u00a0Hunt</strong></span>\u00a0<strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Chase</span></strong> for amateur riders over four miles. Willie Mullins presents two very good horses in, the favourite, <strong>Allee Garde</strong> and, the Denman lookalike, <strong>Soll</strong>.\u00a0 Allee Garde&rsquo;s most recent score was beating Son Amix in Clonmel on heavy ground and ran very well. Soll also scored on his last run in Down Royal and has a chance here. I would be inclined to look for a bit of value all day tomorrow as the racing is a lot more open than today&rsquo;s. The Mouse Morris trained <strong>Four Commanders</strong> is good each way value and, with Nina Carberry aboard, will be in with every chance.\n\nNext up is the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Neptune Investment Novice</strong>&rsquo;<strong>s Hurdle</strong></span> over two mile five. The favourite here is Nicky Henderson&rsquo;s <strong>Simonsig</strong>, and has a very strong chance here. His jumping form is immaculate with two wins and one place from his three starts all on similar ground to what he will encounter tomorrow. However, I think the second favourite <strong>Monksland</strong> will provide a very sturdy challenge. The Noel Meade charge has a perfect record of two wins from two beating a good horse in Lyreen Legend last time in Naas. The other option is the Gigginstown horse <strong>Make Your Mark</strong>. This horse was bred by George Williams of Kilkenny and he rates this horse very highly. He last won at the Christmas Novice Hurdle at Leopardstown and he will be in with a shout tomorrow.\n\nThen we have the <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">RSA</span>\u00a0<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Chase</span></strong> over three miles half a furlong.\u00a0 David Pipe provides the favourite here in Grand Crus, and is the deserved favourite at 6/4 everywhere. I fancy the mount of Davy Russell, <strong>First Lieutenant</strong>, to at least get into the money here if not to cause an upset. He won the Albert Bartlett last year on similar ground by beating today&rsquo;s Champion Hurdle winner Rock on Ruby. Well worth a look.\n\nAfter that is the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Queen Mother Champion Chase</strong></span> over two miles. The favourite for this is Henry de Bromhead&rsquo;s <strong>Sizing Europe</strong> and odds on everywhere. The last confident tip I received from Mr. de Bromhead last Saturday was for Bucker&rsquo;s Bridge in the bumper at Naas. He sluiced home. He is generally a pessimist but I&rsquo;ve been told to take heed when he is confident and he couldn&rsquo;t be more confident about this one. The other tempting option is <strong>Finian&rsquo;s Rainbow</strong>, the ride of Barry Geraghty. This horse will like the ground and should be there thereabouts. Don&rsquo;t rule out the seasoned campaigner <strong>Big Zeb</strong> either, this horse has won me a lot of money over the years!\n\nFour o&rsquo;clock sees the <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Coral Cup</strong></span> which, this year, I deem to be a bit of a lottery. Pick a name, pick colours or stay out of it, which is probably what I will do. However if I do have a bet here I would have to go for <strong>Third Intention</strong>. I watched him win at Fontwell last time out and thought he was very impressive. I think he is great value at 18&rsquo;s. If his price shortens in the morning online get to a bookie&rsquo;s because he just might be gambled in tomorrow. Ground could be a bit softer for him thought.\n\nThe <span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle</strong></span> is another tough one to call. As I look at the market the prices on nearly every horse are currently drifting, and I think it&rsquo;s because the layers don&rsquo;t know too much either. <strong>Vendor</strong> is the favourite but I&rsquo;m not convinced by him as he has only run twice and I can&rsquo;t find out too much about him. <strong>Edeymi</strong> shows decent form and beat a good horse, Chasing Shadows, at Clonmel last time. The fact that Davy Russell has chosen to ride him over his other options would also be a good indicator of his chances. My advice, however, would be to box clever and stay away or keep it very small.\n\nThe last is the <strong><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Champion Bumper</span></strong>, which is always a great race. The favourite tag has been swapped a few times between <strong>New Year&rsquo;s Eve</strong> and <strong>Moscow Mannon</strong> both in and around the 6/1 mark. Both have considerable claims to make and won&rsquo;t be far off the pace. The horse I am a huge fan of is <strong>Champagne Fever</strong>. We were up in Fairyhouse with the TCD Horse Racing Soc the day he won his bumper comfortably, making all the running under Paddy Mullins. He is by a relatively young stallion which stands near our farm in Kells, Co. Kilkenny, by the name of Stowaway. The critics say the Stowaway progeny require heavy ground to run well but this horse won in style on good to soft. I think Stowaway&rsquo;s owner, Mr. Ronnie O&rsquo;Neil, and all at Whytemount stud will agree with me when I say that his offspring are more versatile than given credit for. Jessica Harrington&rsquo;s <strong>Jezki</strong> represents value at 14&rsquo;s having won very impressively at Naas last Sunday week.\n\nTomorrow is a slightly tougher day and all bets should be carefully thought about. Keep the faith and I hope you skin them.
