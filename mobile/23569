The decision comes after Coca-Cola's refusal to withdraw sponsorship for the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.</span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Moira O'Brien, Catering Manager in Trinity, the intention is to withdraw Coca-Cola products from all catering outlets on campus for the two-week period of the Olympics. Ms O'Brien stated that this was in response to pressure from customers, the majority of which are students.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">College catering outlets include The Buttery Food Court, the Dining Hall, the Arts Caf\u00e9, the Hamilton restaurant and the \u00c1ras an Phiarsaigh coffee area.</p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">TCD Students' Union has taken similar steps, suspending sales of Coca-Cola and Proctor &amp; Gamble products in its commercial outlets for the duration of the Sochi Olympics. A previous long-term ban on Coca-Cola was overturned last year, but a Students' IUnion Council motion in December caused the two-week reintroduction of the embargo.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">TCDSU also aims to hold a series of protests against the major corporations that continue to lend support to the Olympics. The first of these will take place on Wednesday February 5th outside the Russian Embassy, prior to the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics. A second protest is set to be held at a later date, with the venue to be confirmed.</span>\r\n\r\nRussia has been internationally condemned following laws banning gay &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; that were passed last year. Other major brands, including McDonald's, Samsung and Visa, have also been severely criticised for their support of the Olympics and their refusal to condemn these laws.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/11967689673_e5bb13028a_z.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23569", "Heading": "TCD Catering to Ban Coca-Cola during the Winter Olympics"}
