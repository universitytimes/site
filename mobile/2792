{"Body": "Bronagh Feehan\n\nYour dad; the omnipresent male figure in a girl's life.\u00a0 It is a relationship akin to no other, sometimes tempestuous but always ardently caring.\u00a0 Whether your knees are bloodied or your heart is shattered your dad will be on hand with hugs.\u00a0 Undoubtedly he may not always employ the use of the myriad of cliches your mother or friends might in times of heartache or trouble, but when he does say something it is frequently the only advice you need to hear.\u00a0 Fundamentally it is a relationship which we all take for granted. \u00a0 It is a relationship which permeates much deeper than one might, at first, realise.\u00a0 Dad's the one who's always there, he's the one who taught you how to drive, who taught you how to stand up for yourself, who taught you how to have belief in your capabilities.\u00a0 So what happens when you think your dad is in trouble.\n\nIt was last summer when the idyllic little world I inhabited as a nineteen year old girl was catapulted into chaos. \u00a0 As discussions with your parents go, it began in quite a mundane manner.\u00a0 I was eager to book a holiday with friends for later that summer.\u00a0 Perhaps it was the fear and emptiness in my parents eyes that told me something was about to alter my plans.\u00a0 Multifarious tears fled down my parents faces as my dad endeavored to explain prostate cancer to my sisters and I.\u00a0 In that moment there is nothing else.\u00a0 You are engulfed by the immense fear of losing your dad.\u00a0 People rallied round my family and helped in every way possible.\u00a0 The consistency of the phone calls and texts received told us that people understood.\u00a0 Cancer.\u00a0 A word saturated with ominous and universal fear.\u00a0 Everybody can comprehend it; a physical disease which is so fervently rampant and curbs us all to some degree.\u00a0 At some stage of our lives we all know we will encounter this volatile visitor in some manner.\n\nHowever,\u00a0 over the recent years a new invader has emanated from the economic disarray we have found ourselves in.\u00a0 For years we fought with potent zeal for independence.\u00a0 For years we hoped our culture would survive invasion.\u00a0 For years we anticipated freedom.\u00a0 Freedom ensued and with that freedom, prosperity and success followed.\u00a0 We were unstoppable, unbeatable and we believed the good times would never end.\u00a0 The idyllic world that this wealth and prosperity concocted enthralled us.\u00a0 We became obsessed with money and its power.\u00a0 The pressure was quietly but arduously building for the bread-winners in every household.\u00a0 Our lavish lifestyles only became more and more lavish.\u00a0 There was no limit. \u00a0 People took risks.\u00a0 Some of these risks resulted in yet more wealth, others resulted in devastation.\u00a0 Embezzlement and gambling on stock markets were both rife.\u00a0 The pressure of maintaining a certain lifestyle had become too trenchant.\u00a0 The colossal losses that ensued ignited a treacherous flame of mental health issues, nervous breakdowns and, in some cases, suicides.\u00a0 Dad's around the country were in trouble.\n\nThis time however, the illness was not as conspicuous.\u00a0 Understanding a mental health issue is overwhelmingly difficult if you have never experienced the lows that a person suffering with depression has, or the unremitting despair and lack of any glimmer of hope that abounds a person who is suicidal.\u00a0 It is undeniable that the families of those suffering from mental health illnesses are submerged in a circle of despair and the feeling that there is nobody who can understand is rife.\u00a0 It is not a physical disease sprung upon you by nature over which you have no control.\u00a0 It is much less straight forward than that.\u00a0 It is a disease which consumes your being, plights your self confidence and in many cases puts your physical well being in serious peril.\u00a0 The glaring reality of losing your job due to your illness and past mistakes only catapults those suffering into deeper depression.\u00a0 As cancer can riddle you physically, mental health illness riddles your mind.\u00a0 When you lose the identity you had from being in the workplace the detriment can be blatantly apparent in your self confidence and the effect of this is huge, especially on your relationships.\u00a0 The lack of understanding of mental health problems is a growing epidemic which needs to be addressed.\u00a0 Those suffering should not feel ashamed or afraid to speak out about their experiences and we as a nation must become more accepting and understanding.\u00a0 Losing your dad to a physical illness is no different to losing your dad to a mental health illness.\u00a0 They both have the same capability of turning your world upside down and changing the person in your life who you thought would forever be there.", "Imageurl": "2793", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2792", "Heading": "Mental Health - Know the Risk"}
