{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Fionn O&rsquo;Dea</strong> | Senior Staff Writer</p>\r\n&ldquo;Chronic&rdquo; underfunding and staff shortages may lead to the introduction of a nominal fee for use of the College Health Centre according to Director of the College Health Service, David McGrath. The centre currently employs 3.2 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) GPs \u00a0(a ratio of 1:5,312 students) down from 3.8 FTE GPs (a ratio of 1:4,032 students) when McGrath&rsquo;s tenure began in 2006. Free on-campus primary health and psychiatric care is offered by the centre between 09.30 and 16.30 on weekdays, catering for approximately 110 students on daily basis.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;We have always resisted charging for the basic consultation but in the wake of our fellow Universities going down this road it is difficult to see how we can avoid the imposition of a charge,&rdquo; McGrath told The University Times. UCD, for instance, introduced a payment system for use of its Health Centre in September 2009 to &ldquo;enable [it] to maintain [its] current level of medical services and also provide a platform for additional services&rdquo; after the position of providing free care became untenable.\r\n\r\nThe current economic difficulties are also reflected in the increased waiting time to avail of the service here. &ldquo;The implication is obvious and is reflected in the average waiting time for a routine appointment rising from two and a half days in 2006 to almost two weeks in 2013.&rdquo; This also represents a week longer on average than three years ago. &ldquo;Another factor is the changing demographics of the student population, with an increased proportion of international students and students from non-traditional backgrounds. These students, in particular the International Post-Graduate students, are disproportionately higher users of The Health Service.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nSpace shortages and potential administrative cut-backs are also of grave concern to McGrath. &ldquo;Administratively, the Service struggles to cope with a huge administrative workload and are currently awaiting a decision on Maternity Cover for a Senior EO who represents 0.9 FTE of a total of 2.6 FTE. Losing over a third of the resource is simply an untenable position.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMinutes from the final College Board meeting of the last academic year, meanwhile, reveal that the Director of Buildings has received several proposals for an expanded centre though &ldquo;premises for the College Health Centre were not in the present capital projects portfolio as there was no money for the project.&rdquo; The current Health Centre was built 25 years ago to cater for a college community of no more than 10,000. The service currently caters for a combined population of over 20,000 students and staff.\r\n\r\nOf the proposed charge, McGrath said that &ldquo;should it be imposed on us, it would certainly be critical to align any such charge with the provision of premises.&rdquo; He continued that although &ldquo;college has provided excellent modern facilities for Student Counselling and Careers in recent times, the Health Service has been left behind.&rdquo; He suggested, based on support given by previous Student Unions, that SU support for the introduction of a nominal consultation fee in the region of &euro;10 could be considered &ldquo;were College to match this funding in the shape of modern premises.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMinutes from a Student Services Committee meeting held last February confirm that: &ldquo;The Trinity Foundation had been asked about financing but there was no agreement for fund-raising as yet.&rdquo; It was determined that &ldquo;a well -functioning health centre was essential to student well-being in College&rdquo; and that the issue of the Service&rsquo;s premises should become a priority item for the Committee. Dean of Health Sciences, Professor Mary McCarron, agreed on this date to champion the proposal.", "Imageurl": "http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/College-Health-1000px.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20574", "Heading": "Health Centre Faces Introduction of Service Fee Due to Lack of Funding"}
