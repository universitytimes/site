{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>Weezer are a tricky little band, straddling two worlds in opposites. They ride high in the public consciousness due to their ubiquitous single &ldquo;Buddy Holly&rdquo;, the stoner anthem &ldquo;Hash Pipe&rdquo;, and the radio-friendly track &ldquo;Island in the Sun&rdquo;, yet despite their mainstream popularity, they also occupy a large space in the heart of every once-geeky hoodied rock fan due to their much-loved 1996 album Pinkerton, which achieved cult status and is highly regarded by their ardent fans. These die-hard fans, in fact, have had to prove their loyalty to the Church of Weezer ever since then really, because the LA band have taken a much different musical route in recent years. And this leads us neatly up to their new record, Ratitude.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s ten tracks of sing-along sunny choruses, guitar-driven verses and simplistic male-seeking-female lyrics. That&rsquo;s right, you read correctly, just ten of the same song again and again. The stand-out track is definitely the lead single, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Your Daddy&rdquo;, which is ever so slightly grimier than the other feel-good upbeat tracks. I have to say, after song after song of repetitive identikit riffs and choruses I did fact get slightly bored, so the frankly bizarre song &nbsp;&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Stop Partying&rdquo; (which features Li&rsquo;l Wayne) was a welcome &ndash; if not to say technically brilliant &ndash; interlude. Overall, it&rsquo;s just a little uninspired &ndash; and thus uninteresting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s definitely still the same old disappointing Pinkerton-departure for most fans, but in my reckoning it&rsquo;s just an inoffensive slice of mindless pop-rock and what harm? It&rsquo;s sing-along and infectious, but ultimately completely forgettable &ndash; most certainly nothing to set the fanboys&rsquo; hearts racing. In fact, the only outright offensive thing about the whole affair is a group of forty year olds crooning about being &ldquo;boys&rdquo; and trying to slow dance some &ldquo;girls&rdquo;. One of the songs is called &ldquo;In The Mall&rdquo; and repeats those same words endlessly, for crying out loud. Grow up, guys.</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>Weezer are a tricky little band, straddling two worlds in opposites.
