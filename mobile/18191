{"Body": "In an attempt to expand the readership of my fledgling blog beyond me, my dear Editor and my Ma, I have decided to use this medium to provide the candidates in the SU election with a chance to expand on some of their policies.\n\n<em>Here&rsquo;s how I envisage this working:</em>\n\nI am going to read the manifestos of each of the candidates in each of the races.\n\nI am going to post a series of questions based on the promises and proposals in the manifestos.\n\nThe candidates can then respond through the comments feature below.\n\nI will not be editing or censoring the comments in any way (unless it is defamatory, which my dear Editor is a bit cautious about since, eh, <em>the</em> incident), although if I think a candidate is talking crap I reserve the right to say so.\n\n<em>Why am I doing this?</em>\n\nAs a former (failed) SU election candidate, I was dismayed (but not surprised) by how little the policies, qualifications or abilities of candidates seemed to matter. The campaigns are far too much of a popularity / beauty (no wonder I lost) contest. This is my modest attempt at redressing some of the balance.\n\nAlso, I am not doing this to catch any candidate out. Far from it. I know how tough it is to put oneself before ones peers and potentially end up making a total tit of oneself. Nearly every candidate I have come across in my experience of SU elections (even many candidates I wouldn&rsquo;t vote for in a fit) has been in it for the right reasons rather than any sort of personal gain.\n\nIn the interests of full disclosure, I am actively supporting two candidates in these elections, Russell Bryce (welfare) and Eleni Megoran (communications). I am also personally friendly with Ryan Bartlett (president), Elaine McDaid (ents), John Cooney (education) and Ronan Costello (communications). Indeed, Ronan presumed I was supporting him and so added me to his private supporters group on Facebook. Ronan, you&rsquo;re a good guy and you would make a good Communications Officer, but next time ask me for my vote first ;)", "Imageurl": "In an attempt to expand the readership of my fledgling blog beyond me, my dear Editor and my Ma, I have decided to use this medium to provide the candidates in the SU election with a chance to expand on some of their policies.\n\n<em>Here&rsquo;s how I envisage this working:</em>\n\nI am going to read the manifestos of each of the candidates in each of the races.\n\nI am going to post a series of questions based on the promises and proposals in the manifestos.\n\nThe candidates can then respond through the comments feature below.\n\nI will not be editing or censoring the comments in any way (unless it is defamatory, which my dear Editor is a bit cautious about since, eh, <em>the</em> incident), although if I think a candidate is talking crap I reserve the right to say so.\n\n<em>Why am I doing this?</em>\n\nAs a former (failed) SU election candidate, I was dismayed (but not surprised) by how little the policies, qualifications or abilities of candidates seemed to matter.
