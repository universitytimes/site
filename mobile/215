Since his first year in college the fourth year Mechanical Engineering student has been involved in activities on campus.\n\nLast year he represented his school as Engineering School Convenor and Deputy Faculty Convenor for Engineering, Maths and Science. One of his more notable achievements was the founding of EMS Day, an annual event which has raised over &euro;9,000.\n\nThis year Cooney claims to have minimised his SU involvement in order to focus on his academic work. This has allowed him to gain some perspective on the work the SU does. With first-hand experience of being on the grant, failing exams and taking out a welfare loan, Cooney claims that he has seen how SU services can be delivered more effectively and efficiently.\n\n&ldquo;In general, I think the Students&rsquo; Union needs to be much more approachable, transparent and efficient,&rdquo; says Cooney. &ldquo;I found it surprising that a lot of students I&rsquo;ve talked to didn&rsquo;t even know who some of their Sabbatical Officers were. The SU can often be seen as a clique - this must change as it could discourage students from seeking its assistance when they really need it.&rdquo;\n\nLike almost all Education Officer candidates in recent years, Cooney maintains that the SU should keep students better informed of its policies and encourage ordinary students to participate in SU Council\n\nThe usual bugbear of all Education Officers is the relatively poor library services offered to Trinity students. As Cooney says, &ldquo;We have the biggest library in Ireland, however we still have the lowest opening hours of any University in the country, even with the current Sunday opening!&rdquo;\n\nOn the course the college should take in the future, Cooney notes that the country will more than likely have a new government by late Spring and Trinity will have a new Provost in August, making student involvement in the policy-making process, particularly in regards to the issue of fees where there is broad consent that fees should be avoided but also a growing recognition of the fact that an increased student contribution of some sort is unavoidable.", "Imageurl": "<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: right; font: 13.0px 'Helvetica Neue'} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 10.0px; font: 9.0px 'Whitney HTF'} span.s1 {letter-spacing: -0.1px} -->John Cooney\n\nSS Engineering\n\n<strong>Education</strong>\n\nIt came as no real surprise that long-time SU activist John Cooney will be contesting the election for Education Officer.
