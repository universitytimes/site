The Cambridge version of\nthe competition has seen winners get as far as Singapore, Hong Kong and San\nFrancisco. Organised by the Law Society and St. Vincent De Paul, funds raised by\nparticipants will go towards helping Amnesty International and Trinity&rsquo;s Vincent De\nPaul branch.\n\nHere we go through the runners and riders of the 2013 and try figure out who could\nbe winning the first ever Trinity College Jailbreak.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_15291\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/03/08/trinity-jailbreak-the-leading-contenders/lf/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-15291\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15291\" title=\"Louise Courtney and Finn Murphy - The Hot Favourites\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/lf3-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a> Louise Courtney and Finn Murphy - The Hot Favourites[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFinn and Louise are the firm favourites of Trinity Jailbreak 2013 and it all comes\ndown to connections. Finn&rsquo;s dad is a pilot and Louise&rsquo;s mum works in the United\nNations. This lethal combination will be very hard to stop. Both DU Snowsports\ncommittee members they know all about organising big trips away. Rumours abound\nof them having already arranged their passage out of Dublin could they have won the\ncompetition before it has even started?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHannah McCarthy and James Ringland &ndash; <em>The Stable Select</em>\n\nThe odd couple of this year&rsquo;s Jailbreak, they have home field advantage, as both are\nmembers of the Law Soc committee. They&rsquo;ve both put in serious hype spade work.\nRingland attracted minor internet fame posting on various airline Facebook pages\nlooking to blag free flights using nothing but the power of the &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button. Hannah\nhas also worked her charm getting retweets from Roisin Ingle and arranging an\nappreance on the John Murray Show. They&rsquo;ve got to be fancied to keep the trophy at\nhome and win for Law Soc.\n\nMollie Guidera and Caroline Von Konig &ndash; <em>The Serious Contenders</em>\n\nA very visible duo of Jailbreak this year, they burst out of the traps with the first\nFacebook page and donations coming in left, right and centre. The trouble is can\nthey last it home or are they a spent force before the competition has even begun?\nThe first 6 hours will be crucial for Mollie and Caroline.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_15293\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/03/08/trinity-jailbreak-the-leading-contenders/cb/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-15293\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15293\" title=\"Claire McCabe and Brian 'Fogo' Fogarty &ndash; The Peoples Champions\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cb3-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> Claire McCabe and Brian 'Fogo' Fogarty &ndash; The Peoples Champions[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter masterminding a victory for Trinity FM as Best Overall Society at the CSC\nawards, Claire McCabe alongside Brian 'Fogo' Fogarty is attempting an ambitious\ndouble. Despite their victory, they haven&rsquo;t let up in trying to win the Jailbreak crown\nwith repeated pleas for help all over Facebook. Their use of radio contacts could be\ncrucial to deciding their performance.\n\nJack Cantillon and Tommy Browne &ndash; <em>The Dark Horses</em>\n\nI won&rsquo;t be saying anything about mine own chances but we could be the dark horses\nto emerge from the pack if a strong Saturday performance comes into fruition.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_15294\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"200\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/03/08/trinity-jailbreak-the-leading-contenders/581828_166268596860407_106607617_n/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-15294\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15294\" title=\"Rosie Goulding and Nicole O' Sullivan - The Likeable Chancres\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/581828_166268596860407_106607617_n3-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a> Rosie Goulding and Nicole O' Sullivan - The Likeable Chancres[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRoise &amp; Nicole have gained a great deal of attention with their &ldquo;USIT Let Us Fly&rdquo;\nvideo appeal. If they get 10,000 likes USIT will fly them to eastern Europe along with\nFull InterRail passes to go even further. Currently at 1,500 likes it seems unlikely\nthey&rsquo;ll reach their target. Still, with such ambition already who&rsquo;s to say they couldn&rsquo;t\npull a rabbit out the hat yet. Dismiss at your peril.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_15295\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/03/08/trinity-jailbreak-the-leading-contenders/581719_166255286861738_2127446213_n/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-15295\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15295\" title=\"David O&rsquo;Carroll and Eden Hoey &ndash; The Each Way Squeak\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/581719_166255286861738_2127446213_n3-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a> David O&rsquo;Carroll and Eden Hoey &ndash; The Each Way Squeak[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDavid and Eden are trying to win for 4th year Law. They&rsquo;re making a good attempt at\nit too. David has been very active on Twitter and even received advice from Graham\nNorton on how to win the competition via Twitter. They&rsquo;ve created a lot of hype but is\nthere any substance?\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_15296\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/03/08/trinity-jailbreak-the-leading-contenders/602845_166252963528637_52934542_n/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-15296\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-15296\" title=\"Timmy Crowley and Callum Swift 9/1 &ndash; The Outside Bet\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/602845_166252963528637_52934542_n3-300x212.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"212\" /></a> Timmy Crowley and Callum Swift 9/1 &ndash; The Outside Bet[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe final contenders that need highlighting are Crowley and Swift. Two video pros,\nexpect their whole journey to be chronicled GoPro in hand. They&rsquo;ve been frantically\nmessaging other contenders to see if anyone has made pre plans. Are they confident\nor are they trying to think of options? Tomorrow morning we&rsquo;ll have our answer.\n\nThe best bet you can make about Jailbreak 2013 is that the winner will probably\nnot come from these favorites. With 40 contenders surely some unknown has\nperformed a minor miracle and got an airline to come on board and support such\nworthy causes. Regardless of the result huge praise must go to Law Soc and VDP\nfor putting together such an exciting and original event. Let the mayhem begin.
