SU outsider Seb LeCocq is struggling with 10% of the vote.\n\nVDP Vice President Louisa Miller leads the pack in Welfare with 43% of the vote in the four-hourse race, with LGBT Auditor Darren O'Gorman in second place on 30%. Russell Bryce and Caroline Keating pick up the remainders with 9% and 6% respectively.\n\nThe greatest margin lies between University Times News Editor, Ronan Costello (60%), and Trinity News Sports Editor Eleni Megoran (28%) in the battle for Communications Officer and Editor of The University Times.\n\nSU Assistant Campaigns Officer Rachel Barry (54%) has a strong lead ahead of EMS Day co-founder John Cooney (32%), with 14% of students preferring to Re-Open Nominations (i.e. none of the above) at this stage in the campaigns.\n\nTom Lowe, Editor\n\n<em>It should be noted that the methods used for this poll are non-scientific and they should be used as a guide only. </em>", "Imageurl": "1049", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1048", "Heading": "UT Poll: Pres, Ents, neck and neck after two days' campaigning"}
