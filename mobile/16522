The move stems from recommendations in the Hunt report, which suggested that 'there may be a case for facilitating the evolution of some existing institutes [of technology] following a process of consolidation, into a form of university that is different in mission from the existing Irish universities.\n\nA number of ITs submitted proposals for Technological University status to the government last year. It is understood that Galway-Mayo, Sligo and Letterkenny institutes have been unsuccessful in their bid for TU status as the cluster failed to match criteria set by the Higher Education Authority.\n\nThe government's technological university model is heavily informed by the European Commission's 'Innovative Union' strategy and the TU structure aims to transform institutes into centers of technological innovation, through the sharing of knowledge capital and industry linkages.\n\nIn a statement released today, the Union of Students in Ireland said the student experience must be the top priority in technological university mergers. &ldquo;Students' Unions in the relevant institutions have campaigned alongside College authorities for this development, recognising that the creating of technological universities will likely improve the student experience, academically and otherwise.\n\n'If these mergers are carried out successfully, they will better focus the resources allocated to our third-level institutions, reducing waste and duplication across colleges.", "Imageurl": "16526", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "16522", "Heading": "Landscape of higher education to shift as technological universities receive green light"}
