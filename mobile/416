{"Body": "<p>The full title of Paula Byrne&rsquo;s biography of Evelyn Waugh, Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead, threatens a book of easy solutions to a difficult subject. The languid nostalgic ambience of Oxford is so evocative, that when dealing with a subject connected to the elite university it can be tempting to dwell on this and this alone. Similarly, the sprawling country estate awash with clich&eacute;d rolling hills and stereotypical frivolous homosexuals is provocative enough to hold sway for an entire book. But Byrne pushes past the somewhat obvious amber hues of Waugh&rsquo;s time in Oxford and Madresfield (the real life Brideshead) and produces a portrayal that is astute without being analytical, and sympathetic without being sentimental.</p>\n<p>With such emphasis on the story of Brideshead and its somewhat chaotic, though always eclectic and endearing, inhabitants, it can be difficult to disassociate Waugh from the persona of an intellect steeped in snobbery and a social networker obsessed with pedigree. During his lifetime he was often criticized for being in awe of the aristocracy and all too readily wielding a sharp tongue. To us this may seem fitting for a supposed socialite and dandy in possession of a cutting wit, but Byrne is adamant that this common misconception is not only unjust, but alludes to a wilful misunderstanding of the author. Byrne&rsquo;s book acts as both historical companion and confidential intimate, all too willing to disclose to us detail after detail that finally culminates in an image of a man whose primary concern was &ldquo;The day is wasted on which we have not laughed&rdquo;, greatly lessening the stereotyped persona that perhaps matches the oeuvre more than the individual.</p>\n<p>Byrne mirrors her subject in skilfully churning out anecdotal character sketches. A sense of every cast member is achieved (and there are dozens) with a quickness and agility that gives the text the kind of liveliness associated with Waugh&rsquo;s own fiction. Byrne has managed to immerse herself seamlessly into a world that though in terms of decades is not long gone, is deeply marked with nostalgia and a melancholic sense of loss, with the second world war acting as an irrefutable bookend. Without her ability to conjure up the lively, engaging and often inebriated personalities, the book would run the risk of all historical biographies where a great deal about the subject is known i.e. reading as simply one long list of diary entries and quotes. Her skilfully animated caricatures capture, for us, the mood of a changing and ruptured era. This tendency to caricature extends to descriptions of Waugh&rsquo;s novels, which appear always with affection and sometimes with a certain star struck quality.</p>\n<p>Despite the specific nature of the title, Waugh&rsquo;s biographer doesn&rsquo;t weigh down the reader with constant connections and links. In reading about Waugh&rsquo;s relationship with Elmley and Hugh Lydon, we are not forced into multiple contrived comparisons with &ldquo;Bridey&rdquo; and Sebastian Flyte. The reader can flesh out the anecdotes and associations for themselves, (very rewarding for lovers of the novel) and so despite the abundance of historical and personal detail the amount of information is never stifling. The flow of the text is lively and exuberant, an absolute must in dealing with such a vivacious and spirited character.<br />Although Byrne can never be said to indulge in sentimentality or indeed to gush with praise for Waugh, there are at times hints of aggression, or a refusal to believe anything less than savoury about the comedic author. Such statements as &ldquo;Ann Fleming killed Evelyn Waugh&rdquo; weaken the strength of the author&rsquo;s voice, when after reading on a few lines we discover her role was to relay an insult said behind his back years before his death. There are also plural incidents of Waugh describing sexual encounters with child prostitutes, and though it&rsquo;s the task of the biographer to maintain an objective stance, the pointed lack of comment in such instances reads as an unwillingness to delve deeper.
