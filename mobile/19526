{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Italian-born Valeria Nicolosi, nanoscientist at Trinity College, has been awarded a &euro;150,000 grant from the European Research Council to pursue the research and development of an energy storage device using nanomaterials. The grant will enable her to develop the product, and to test its viability in the technology sector.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Professor Nicolosi\u00a0is the only Irish-based researcher to be awarded the grant, which is part of the ERC&rsquo;s \"Proof of Concept\" initiative. In allocating a total of almost &euro;5 million to selected researchers who responded to the first call for proposals, the ERC seeks to bridge the gap between research and marketable innovation. An array of research fields, from the engineering sector to that of neuroscience, has received financial backing under the initiative.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nicolosi&rsquo;s research centres around creating the supercapacitor, a form of electronic storage device, using nanomaterials. Availing of a process called &ldquo;ultrasonic spray deposition&rdquo;, she envisions constructing the device using two-dimensional sheets no thicker than an atom. The high power density which the supercapacitor offers would enable the storage of more energy than regular capacitors. It would also be ultra-thin, durable and heat resistant.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Improved energy storage systems are of particular importance with the sustained use of renewable energy sources such as solar panels and wind farms.</p>\r\nProfessor Nicolosi&rsquo;s research, funded by the ERC initiative, could uncover real potential for the exploitation of nanomaterials in the context of energy storage, and more. The \"Proof of Concept\" initiative represents a positive step in maintaining a competitive European market, encouraging job creation, and fostering a spirit of entrepreneurship within the EU.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/val1.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19526", "Heading": "TCD Nanoscientist Awarded &euro;150,000 Grant for Innovative Energy Storage System"}
