Part-booklet, part-virtual manual, the TCDconnect service outlines more than a dozen individual steps which, if followed attentively, will furnish the diligent seeker with &ldquo;fast, secure internet access&rdquo;, so that they may enjoy glorious virtual boons on the TCD campus.</p>\nWith regard to Irish Universities at large however, it should be noted that this torturous &ldquo;Fort Knox&rdquo; style of authentication practice is unusual to say the least. UCD striplings, for example, need only supply a college username and password, and bob&rsquo;s-your-uncle they&rsquo;re away and connected to their student network. Indeed one such stripling, upon reading the lengthy online portion of the &ldquo;TCDconnect guide for students&rdquo; that I showed him, was heard to remark &ldquo;surely, a joke?&rdquo; as he shook his head in disbelief, and continued to enjoy his unrestricted McDonalds Wifi.\n\nA probing of the mass outpouring of grief that surrounds this network, along with a few other little gibes at IS Services, now follows.\n\nSome time, take a spell to go and find the TCDconnect network clinic (199 Pearse St.&mdash;take the humble, bunker-like side entrance with the green door). Here you can sit, gaze, and marvel at the hordes of nervous, sometimes tearful, Trinity students waiting like addled drug addicts for a cyber-fix from the I.S. pros. Overwhelmed by the labyrinthine task of connecting to the network, these poor, exhausted souls have had to &ldquo;book in&rdquo; to one of the four network clinics (also known as &ldquo;troubleshooting clinics&rdquo;) that take place in 199 Pearse St. every week. For many this is not their first time, nor their last.\n\nI spoke to one of them. We stepped outside the clinic. I extended a magnanimous hand. Here&rsquo;s a tasty gob from the interview with this troubled female adolescent that followed. Sadly she refused to be indentified for the purposes of the interview:\n\n&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I asked punchily.\n\n&ldquo;Remember; I can&rsquo;t tell you&rdquo; she replied, calmly.\n\n&ldquo;Ok&rdquo; I conceded. &ldquo;What brings you here?&rdquo; I quizzed her.\n\n&ldquo;I think my Anti-Virus software must be out of date or something, because I can&rsquo;t get connected to the Trinity network at the moment. I&rsquo;m here to get it sorted, but it takes so long! First you have to book it around your schedule, and then when you get here there&rsquo;s only two staff working here!&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;First timer?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;I wish!&rdquo; she chuckled noiselessly. &ldquo;No, I had to go through the same rigmarole as everyone else in getting connected to the network in the first place, but in fairness the network clinics have come a long way since then, the queues used to be a lot worse. Still though, I just don&rsquo;t see why it should be so difficult to connect in the first place! It&rsquo;s just Wifi, but they&rsquo;ve made it so complicated that it seems that half the students trying to connect have to come to this clinic before they get on, and that&rsquo;s just wasting everybody&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;\n\nWhispering, I provokingly asked her what words she would use to describe this TCDconnect network service, and suddenly her brow furrowed and she rapidly spat out the words &ldquo;atrocious, dire, shoddy&rdquo; with astonishing vitriol.\n\n&ldquo;Anything else to add?&rdquo;\n\n&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s just about everything.&rdquo;\n\nJust as she thought she was free to leave, however, I hit her with it. &ldquo;What about the rumours?&rdquo;\n\nShe looked baffled. &ldquo;What rumours?!&rdquo;\n\nIt is no great secret, and lies beyond the scope of this article, that rumours of ink-fanged, over-sized &lsquo;Comp Doctors of Death&rsquo; repeatedly subjecting defenseless Junior Freshman students to hideous, unspeakable cyber-rituals have been spreading across college like wildfire over the last few months. I posited it to her.\n\n&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;the people that I&rsquo;ve come in contact with have been kind, helpful and of a distinctly average size. &lsquo;Comp doctors of death&rsquo; is certainly not a term I would use.&rdquo;\n\n&lsquo;Comp Doctors of death&rsquo; or no, this anonymous female adolescent&rsquo;s complaint of TCDconnect torment is hardly an isolated incident. Indeed in a survey among Trinity Students undertaken by I.S. Services pertaining to the TCDconnect service, 65.8% of the 820 students surveyed found it either &ldquo;moderately difficult&rdquo; or &ldquo;very difficult&rdquo; to register to the network, while a threadbare 6.7% found it &ldquo;very easy&rdquo; to register. And despite the recent I.S. services initiative of online booking for the Death Camps (I should say network clinics), of the 349 students surveyed for &ldquo;How did you register to attend a TCDconnect service troubleshooting clinic?&rdquo; a whopping 70% said that they had done so &ldquo;via the helpdesk walk-in service&rdquo;, while only 30% said they had done so &ldquo;via the online TCDconnect booking service.&rdquo; Let us now examine about the miserable fate of the whopping 70%.\n\n18 minutes. Let me repeat that once more for emphasis. 18 minutes. According to the IS Services &ldquo;Key Performance Indicators&rdquo;, that was the average queuing time for the I.S. services &ldquo;helpdesk-walk in service&rdquo; in the month of January 2012. That&rsquo;s a LONG time. Factor this into the shambolic, puzzlingly irregular opening hours (mon, wed, fri 10am-1pm; tues, thurs, 2-5pm), and you get risibly low averages: 10 people seen per day, 40 people seen per week, many of whom are redirected to one of those god-awful &ldquo;troubleshooting clinics&rdquo; in any case.\n\nBut what is there to do to pass the time while you wait 18 minutes? Amusements are, admittedly, few and far between. Two friendly vending machines are worth a look, as is the white Is Services screen displaying sapless, inoffensive bulletins, while light banter with the ever-present \u00c1ras an Phiarsaigh security personnel can make 5 of the minutes seem like 4. On the whole, however, it is an extraordinarily dull affair, and queuers with a growling stomach should be warned that the modest canteen is best described as a poor relation to the two vending machines; a packed lunch is advisable.\n\nSo what lies in store for the next generation of Trinity youngsters thirsty for effortless network connection? With the hacking abilities of a certain Junior Freshman student grabbing international news headlines last week (mug-shot and all!), one can only speculate that a sadistic IS Services cyber-tome, packed full of cryptic, void TCDconnect steps, is to follow.", "Imageurl": "9662", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "9647", "Heading": "Sigh: IS SERVICES"}
