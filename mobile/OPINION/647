I&rsquo;ve taken up study and the gym, now it&rsquo;s time to give up alcohol, give up cigarettes, and give up the hedonistic days of first to third year. But not necessarily give up all hope. I don&rsquo;t see the point of eradicating all semblance of a social life in the name of exams. While of course it&rsquo;s never the best idea to spend every night getting trashed a week before your final exams, neither is it healthy to restrict yourself to fourty minutes of social interaction a day.

Continuous assessment was introduced to scare the hell out of the wasters.

As I made my way to &ldquo;The Zimmer Room&rdquo; you can imagine the reservations running through my head. While I&rsquo;m all for active elderly, putting a room they can dance in down two flights of stairs seems a little sadistic.
