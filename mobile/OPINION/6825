There had been people talking about this mysterious figure called Monti, but at that time the possibility of a government led by him was a rumour that circulated around like an urban myth. However, the unsettling economic situation in which Europe has found itself, especially in more recent times, required a big a change, and a sudden one.\n\nBut who is this mysterious figure set to save Italy's economy and pride? He is a very influential economist, an important academic (having served as both rector and president of Bocconi University in Milan) and has worked with the EU as European Commissioner in the field of competition and internal market, services, customs and taxation. Described as &ldquo;unlike an Italian&rdquo; by EU commission president Jacques Santer, he appears to be antithetical to Berlusconi, being serious, a non-party animal and extremely protective of his privacy. He was given the task to find a way to solve the critical economic moment, in which Italy finds itself at the moment, forming a technocratic government.\n\nTechnocracy. A new word, which first brings to mind sinister images of robots and machines mercilessly ruling over people, or maybe a government in which people are experts in technology. The actual meaning however is a government formed by people who have a high degree of expertise in the various governmental fields. So that&rsquo;s it, no machines nor robots ruling. At least for now.\n\nSince the appointment of the new executive, the whole situation has been very unclear; Italy needs some serious reforms on pensions, fiscal policies, and growth. Tax evading is another big issue that needs to be tackled quickly and seriously. And finally there is the issue of the endless privileges enjoyed by the various politicians, ranging between useless expensive cars, double salaries and the perks and subsidies that make the average Italian increasingly sceptical of all politicians regardless of which party they belong to.\n\nThe lack of trust that people have in their elected representatives, not only in Italy but in other countries as well, is symptomatic of the problems that politics faces today. The difference is however that whilst in Spain and Greece the main political parties or even the previous prime minister, tried to find a way to solve the problem within the legitimacy of a democratic government, in Italy the main parties preferred to continue to quarrel on matters of little importance, while failing to look at the bigger picture: the impatient markets and the economic crisis.\n\nOne hopes that new Italian PM, will find a way to ensure that the necessary reforms go through without further aggravating the economic situation of those families that struggle daily. One hopes as well that the parties will find the necessary strength to support the decisions of the new government, forming a cohesive front. Italy has a history of crisis and rebirths, the Renaissance being one of them; it faces an uphill and rocky road ahead but I am positive that it can, and will rise again, but to do so it will need the help of every Italian regardless of economic condition or political belief.", "Imageurl": "6826", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6825", "Heading": "Berlusconi no more"}
