I hope to work on issues that affect students from the lecture theatre to the work place, allowing them to have the student life they deserve, making college an unforgettable experience, as it should be. It is essential for students to be involved in campus life and to reach those who are not to create a positive experience for each student. Off-campus hours is the beginning of my commitment to including all students in the college experience. Most importantly I want revive the feeling that the SU is for everyone and works for everyone. From national campaigns to local issues such as keeping the health centre open at lunch time.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px;\">I am currently in final year Medicine and have enjoyed a long history of involvement with the SU. From being class Rep to School\u00a0</span></span>Convenor,<span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"line-height: 19px;\">\u00a0 Health science Faculty convenor, sitting on Faculty Executive and college councils. I am currently the Assistant Campaign Officer for the Union. By bringing all this experience to the table I am sure I will be successful in making a difference in college and achieving all my aims.</span></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Housing has been an on-going issue for many incoming students and working on making it an easier and time effective experience is vital. I want to help the accommodation service in creating easily accessible housing listings in hot spots around the city and matching up students in similar courses. This way student will no longer need to search for weeks for a place to stay or a house mate to share with.</span>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_14834\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/02/07/why-i-should-be-su-president-lylas-aljohmani/lylas/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14834\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-14834\" title=\"lylas\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/lylas3-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> Aljohmani at Tuesday's Dining Hall hustings.

I want all students to have the opportunity to be mentored by someone who has completed their course. Knowing what graduates have achieved in different sectors will give you a broader idea of what opportunities are available and who you can get there. These will be course specific and duration will of course vary on what we can gain from willing Alumni. This will prove to be invaluable to students in the long term.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Along with working on local issues affecting students I am dedicated to fighting for improvement in the education system. An effective way of lobbying with government officials will undoubtedly need to be backed up by students. A way that student can produce this support is by voting in local and general elections. I would like to bring voting to campus to make it easier for student to do so.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">There are many aspects of the union that need to be addressed and improved. I believe I am the person that will bring the union forward with some hard work, enthusiasm, and experience. No mater what the issue is, big or small, I will work to find the best solution possible for all students.\u00a0</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Read Rosa Langhammer's article <a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/02/07/why-i-should-be-su-president-rosa-langhammer/\"><strong>here.</strong></a></em>\n<em>Read Tom Lenihan's \u00a0article\u00a0<strong><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/02/07/why-i-should-be-su-president-tom-lenihan/\">here.</a></strong></em>", "Imageurl": "14834", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CoverPhoto423", "ID": "14832", "Heading": "Why I Should Be SU President - Lylas Aljohmani"}
