{"Body": "Matt Turner\n\nThe media cites us as another &ldquo;lost generation&rdquo; struggling to find a place within Irish business and economic circles, whilst others regard us as a generation left with the unrelenting task of picking up the leftovers from the Celtic Tiger...&rdquo;The Celtic Tiger Cubs&rdquo;. Where then do we turn? Do we find voice in another political party or is there a new vibrant alternative? We have probably heard about the 1960s, 70s and 80s in Ireland from other generations as a time of social unrest and economic inequality with high unemployment and emigration. Irish students&rsquo; experiences and prospects during that time were therefore not greatly different to that of ours today, but instead of relying on politicians to change things, students became aware of creating a new environment for themselves; their actions and attitudes to such issues involved sending a message independently of the political system.\n\nThat era brought with it the rise of a new popular culture, led by names and artists we still listen to and praise today The 1960s and 1970s was no doubt the beginning of something new and exciting: a counter culture revolution led in large by a united student body from all four corners of the globe. This revolution aimed at changing conservative society for a more open and equal society. Interestingly though it was not the politicians or governments that were reshaping old habits and asking for a fairer society, but from a united student front.\n\nDemonstrations enacted by students from Beijing to San Francisco were something new and special, never seen or repeated before. In the 1960s students at University California Berkeley organised a free speech movement aimed at promoting civil rights to formerly unrepresented minorities. Many believed this kick-started the civil rights campaign in America due to the coverage and extent of the demonstrations and protests. In 1989 students in China held mass demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, passionately voicing the need for political and economic reform. These students put themselves on the line, many dying for a cause they believed in.\n\nIn Ireland too students were organising the &ldquo;gentle revolution&rdquo; to protest against the way the Irish university system was run. Boycotting lectures, mass meetings and widespread demonstrations were organised in an effort to reform a university sector which many believed was highly undemocratic placing those running at the top and everyone else at the bottom. Students at Queens University Belfast campaigned vigorously for civil rights in Northern Ireland and architecture students from DIT organised a successful nation-wide campaign to prevent the demolition of Georgian Dublin.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1783\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Student protests, a historical affair\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/photos-to-change-the-world-paris-student-protests-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1783\" title=\"photos-to-change-the-world-paris-student-protests-1\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/photos-to-change-the-world-paris-student-protests-1-300x201.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"201\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nHistory tells us then students from all over the world were able to organise effective nationwide campaigns which fundamentally raised awareness on pressing issues of the day and they did this largely without the help of their political representatives! How?  Through a united student front characterised by common principals and values which still holds true to this day, although arguably to a lesser extent.\n\nIt would seem then that the most successful student campaigns were supported by a student population that were largely united in terms of ideology, interests and background. The student population of Ireland today is more powerful and larger than ever before. It can therefore reconfigure and recreate the voice of students in Ireland, by showing that we can positively impact on national issues for the better. We can provide a new alternative for those that are disillusioned with the political establishment, political reform need not come from the inside but from the outside; and this is where the future role of the student body lies, in re-establishing the student body as an energetic force, with an ability to represent and solve local and national issues. However all this requires an ability to connect with each other and as a veteran of the college scene, I believe from experience that we are largely unified on issues relating to the country as a whole and this gives us the ability to organise mass campaigns and demonstrations in favour of the society at large. We therefore provide a new voice and alternative for those disenfranchised with politics!\n\nTherefore we must awake our ability to lead by impacting positively for change. Ireland is a small country and more students are finding a common ground to approach difficult issues. The commitment and enthusiasm is there and this is most evidently showcased by the Nursing and Midwifery students who continue to campaign unrelentingly for equal opportunities and working conditions. The students rumble whilst the politicians fade away; not voting? Don&rsquo;t worry your student body is here to stay!\n\nMatt Turner", "Imageurl": "1784", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1782", "Heading": "Panic on the streets of Dublin: Student Power"}
