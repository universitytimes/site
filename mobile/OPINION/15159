Progression in the areas of understanding and acceptance has now been jeopardised for future generations of Russians due to what the Bill entails. It seeks to outlaw public events based around the LGBT community as well as banning the dissemination of information about LGBT issues to minors. The punishment for not following these proposed rules would be a monetary fine ranging from 5,000 roubles (&euro;120) to 500,000 (&euro;12,000).\n\n&nbsp;\nThe crux of the problem is the fact that the Bill enjoys popular support in Russia, which might come as a shock to our Western palates. The Bill itself passed by a clear majority with the aid of the current ruling party, United Russia, by 388 votes for, with one against and one abstention. This displays how this regressive legislation has achieved cross party support, an achievement which is a rare occurrence in Parliaments across the globe.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe sense of ignorance in Russian society is overwhelming. The developments in Russia contradicts an age which must be applauded for its increasing action on the issue of LGBT rights. \u00a0The language of the Bill is backward and unenlightened. However, the language of the Bill reflects not only the preferences of politicians, but a collective mentality.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the past 20 years Russia has undergone a gargantuan and difficult policy of liberalisation, both in the economic and social sense. This progression has not been possible without a series of sacrifices and the International community has noted the miraculous turn around Russia has achieved in such a condensed period of time. The Bill is just the latest development in the long and difficult journey which the Russian LGBT community has had to endure.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHomosexuality was legalised within the nation in 1993; however, the government only formally recognised that homosexuality was no longer a mental condition in 1999. As a result of the recent decriminalisation, discussion of issues which affect the LGBT community or homosexuality in general is still considered to be a societal taboo.\n\n&nbsp;\nA 2010 study by the Moscow based polling firm, The Levada Centre, found that 84% of those polled opposed the concept of gay marriage, 41% didn&rsquo;t feel homosexuals deserved the same rights as other Russians and most worryingly, 18% felt that homosexuals should be isolated from society in an attempt to save children.\n\n&nbsp;\nFor too long now the Russian LGBT community has been has had to endure repeated discrimination fuelled by misinformation and backward beliefs. Part of the issue for the gay community is the fact that such legislation is enjoying a high level of popular support, in particular from Russians who consider themselves to be nationalists and Russian Orthodox. This legislation will further solidify the inherent ignorance as now anti-gay groups will have an unhindered ability to continue their campaign of misinformation as any effective opposition may be easily silenced.\n\n&nbsp;\nAttempts by the LGBT community to raise awareness about the issues affecting the community have been frequently met with violence from various right-wing and religious groups. Moreover, due to the frequently violent nature which surrounds them, events such as Moscow&rsquo;s Gay Pride Parade have been banned indefinitely. In the case of Moscow, legislation currently in place has resulted in an official ban on any Pride Parades taking place until 2112 at the latest.\n\n&nbsp;\nOpposition groups to the proposed Bill have voiced their concern at the loose wording being used. Some are worried that this would be interpreted loosely and could result in fines being imposed for acts like promoting opinions on LGBT rights in the media or the simple act of hand holding in public. These concerns have highlighted just how discriminatory this law could be.\n\n&nbsp;\nEvidently, this does not appear to be a problem just located within Russia. Similar legislation to what was just passed has also been proposed in other nations within the region, such as Ukraine and Lithuania, the latter being a current EU member. Such proposals are just the most public example of the strong undercurrent of homophobia which appears to be widespread throughout the region. With the rise of nationalism, particularly in Russia, such issues have appeared to have worsened, not solely based upon their ideology but more upon the levels of violence which is displayed by a sizeable minority of these groups. Such violence has not been targeted just at members of the LGBT community but anyone who is a vocal opponent of their ideals.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe issue which arises from this is that we now have a clear piece of evidence which proves the &ldquo;undemocratic&rdquo; democracy which is in place in modern day Russia. For years there have been talks of mass voter fraud and intimidation, which has been conducted by a variety of parties, including the current ruling United Russia party. However, we have not had such a brazen and clear attempt to completely silence an active opposition movement. The enacting of such a Bill would result in a further consolidation of the taboo that discussion of homosexuality by removing the only method in which such a social barrier may collapse.\n\n&nbsp;\nWith this law, the members of the State Duma have decided to once again select inaction over addressing the real issue that is affecting the LGBT community within Russia, which is that the people of Russia are unaware of the issues which affect the community, especially in the case of the young people in Russia. The result of this is not only a horrific loss in a people&rsquo;s freedom of expression but also that the Russian Duma has now decided to pretend this issue doesn&rsquo;t exist rather than actively legislating and properly dealing with it.\n\n&nbsp;\nThe Bill is expected to be debated in the Russian Upper House, the Federation Council, where a United Russia majority is expected to pass it on for a final approval by President Putin, which is set for some time in mid-June. Supporters of the Bill are confident on its passing with only minimal alterations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf the Bill is passed then the Russian LGBT community will be forced to accept that their society and elected representatives have cast a blind eye to a new era of acceptance and understanding. It passing will ensure that the rights of the LGBT community are, once again, destined to have a bleak outlook for the foreseeable future.", "Imageurl": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/russia-gay-rights3.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15159", "Heading": "Ten Steps Back for LGBT Rights in Russia"}
