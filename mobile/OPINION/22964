{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Ciar McCormick</strong> | Staff Writer</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since Martin O&rsquo;Neill and Roy Keane were appointed to manage Ireland in late 2013 there has been a shuffling of cards within the Irish squad. With new management come new tactics, new formations, and hopefully better results. But For O&rsquo;Neill and Keane getting the best possible players to play for Ireland will be essential; one of the players to be considered is Stephen Ireland. Since the appointment of new management there have been calls for Stephen Ireland&rsquo;s return to the Irish squad.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">Stephen Ireland has had a changeable career in football so far.</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stephen Ireland has had a changeable career in football so far. He began his career with Cobh Ramblers before joining English club Manchester City in 2001. He made his professional debut in September 2005 and soon established himself as a regular at the City of Manchester Stadium. He scored 23 goals in 176 appearances for City predominantly under the management of Mark Hughes. His performances saw him earn international recognition when he was called up to the Ireland squad in 2006. In 5 international appearances he scored 4 goals including the first goal in Croke Park against Wales on 24th March 2007. However a row with Steve Staunton saw his international career come to an abrupt end, &ldquo;I left under bad circumstances,&rdquo; he told the BBC&rsquo;s Ivan Gaskell. He has also played for Aston Villa and Newcastle before joining Stoke City on loan this season.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Encouraging signs have come from the Cobh native recently after he is reported to have said to the BBC&rsquo;s Ivan Gaskell: &ldquo;This new management has excited me. We&rsquo;ll have to sit down and talk. I&rsquo;ve a lot to think about. We&rsquo;ll have to have a sit down and talk, and see what we can do. It&rsquo;s something that appeals to me. To return and play a few campaigns. I&rsquo;d like to go back and see how it goes&rdquo;. As vague and non-committal as a football press conference usually is, like being played along by a non-committal lover it is still full of hope for the future.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ken Early interrogated Roy Keane on the potential second coming of Stephen Ireland in which he said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s great to see him back playing&hellip; there&rsquo;s loads of areas that I&rsquo;m sure Martin will look at players that have been on the scene. I know a few lads that have been off the scene &mdash; people like Stokesy &mdash; so you know if Ireland is any bit interested in coming and playing for Ireland again and Martin gets involved and he wants me to get involved then we&rsquo;ve got to get these players back involved, absolutely.&rdquo; The pieces seem to be coming to together for a return to Irish national football for Stephen Ireland, but Mark Hughes may want Ireland (the player that is) to be a bit more cautious.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">Surprise, surprise the man appointed manager of Stoke City on 30th May 2013 and currently at the helm of the midland club is in fact Mark Hughes.</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stoke City manager Mark Hughes has said Stephen Ireland is not ready to return to international football just yet and must focus on his Premier League career with the Potters. Hughes officially was reported to have said \"Stephen&rsquo;s doing OK but he's is not quite at the level that he was at two or three years ago\".</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It has to be noted that Stephen Ireland&rsquo;s return to form as of late at Stoke City may be down to the management of Mark Hughes. It would appear both Ireland and Hughes have a close relationship. Hughes managed Ireland at the peak of his playing career between 2008 and 2009 at Manchester City. In September 2010 Ireland was transferred to Aston Villa in a swap deal with James Milner. After a slow start to his Villa career he was loaned out to Newcastle United where he only played twice. \u00a0This dip in form gradually ended when in the 2011&ndash;12 season he improved and won the Fans Player of the Season award. However he fell out of the first team under Paul Lambert and in September 2013 he joined Stoke City on loan. Surprise, surprise the man appointed manager of Stoke City on 30th May 2013 and currently at the helm of the midland club is in fact Mark Hughes. After signing the Cobh man on a loan deal he has played him consistently this season making 11 appearances and scoring 2 goals, one against Swansea and the other in the shock win against Chelsea.</p>\r\nThere is no doubt that Ireland is a skilful and talented player that would add to the ranks of the Irish squad. It appears Stephen Ireland may be coming ever closer to putting on the green jersey once more. If he can reach his potential at Stoke City, it would be fantastic to also see him back playing for <em>the boys in green</em> once more too.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Stephen-Ireland-001.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22964", "Heading": "Ireland's Second Coming?"}
