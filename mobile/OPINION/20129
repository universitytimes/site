{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Jemma O'Leary</em> \u015a <strong>Contributing Writer</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It seems like we&rsquo;ve all seen the words &lsquo;misogynist&rsquo; and &lsquo;anti-feminist&rsquo; bandied around a lot in the press lately, whether it&rsquo;s to do with the reaction to Miley Cyrus&rsquo; performance at the VMA&rsquo;s or the antics of the anonymous &lsquo;Slane Girl&rsquo; at Slane Castle during the summer. What worries me is that the &lsquo;ultra-feminist&rsquo; faction of our society seem increasingly to be using these words as part of a dubious defence for what, when it comes down to it, is illegal and inexcusable public behaviour.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0Writing this article as a woman, and a feminist at that, I&rsquo;m prepared for the amount of abuse I&rsquo;m about to get from the hardcore bra-burning ultra-fems who are going to brand this article as an educated attempt at slut-shaming. Let me state from the beginning that I am not an advocate of calling 17-year-old girls &lsquo;whores&rsquo; online or making my peers&rsquo; sex lives the subject of derision. I am writing this article to explore one question: has &lsquo;ultra-feminism&rsquo; given women a mandate to act in a way that is both legally and morally unacceptable?</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0I&rsquo;m going to use the still-controversial subject of Slane Girl as an example. While it&rsquo;s clear that the two - the girl and the boy - were equally at fault, the majority of Tweets and Facebook statuses I saw chose to focus on the fact on the boy had not been blamed for any of it - while simultaneously blaming him and only him. These pseudo-feminist broadcasts chose to skirt around the issue that both boy and girl had broken not just some sort of moral code which the ultra-feminists which would no doubt call &lsquo;outdated&rsquo;, but the actual law. Yes, as many issues as I and others might have with our Constitution, it still holds firm, and the law on indecent exposure clearly states that &ldquo;any person who commits, in public, any act in such a way as to offend modesty or cause scandal or injure the morals of the community shall be guilty\".</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The fact that this girl, although a minor, had broken the law of course went over the heads of the ultra-feminists, who managed to turn the whole affair into an anti-misogynistic tirade against the internet trolls who targeted the girl. This, and not the actions of the boy and girl themselves, has been the subject of most of the debate surrounding the whole story. Certainly in my Facebook circle, the whole affair got to the point where it was tantamount to heresy to suggest that the girl had been at fault in any way. And this is where modern feminism begins to grate on me. I would be the last person to say that those internet users (male and female, by the way, something which also receives little attention) abusing Slane Girl were anything more than cruel and disgusting trolls. The level of personal abuse which the girl received was unwarranted in any way.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But I resent the fact that modern ultra-feminism has brought us to the point where taking a woman to task for actions which are both legally and morally reprehensible has become something that we should be almost ashamed to do - because we are being &lsquo;misogynistic&rsquo; and &lsquo;anti-feminist&rsquo;. God forbid that anybody should pare back the whole Slane Girl situation to the basic facts - that this girl performed an oral sex act on a boy in a public place, and that this is unacceptable behaviour by what should be anybody&rsquo;s standards. Should we as a society actively encourage this, or at best tolerate it with a smile, for fear of seeming outdated or conservative? Am I a fascist for not thinking that this is OK? Am I repressing women, denying them their sexual freedom?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"\u00a0Before everyone leaps on me for being a cold-hearted bitch condemning this girl to a lifetime of guilt and ridicule, let me say that for her personally, I feel a lot of sympathy.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&rsquo;m sure that the ultra-feminists would tell you that I am. It saddens me that ultra-feminism has eroded society&rsquo;s values to such an extent that I would probably be labelled &lsquo;anti-feminist&rsquo; for thinking that it&rsquo;s perfectly all right to admit that &lsquo;Slane Girl&rsquo;s actions were wrong.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before everyone leaps on me for being a cold-hearted bitch condemning this girl to a lifetime of guilt and ridicule, let me say that for her personally, I feel a lot of sympathy. I obviously understand that what happened was a drunken mistake that was unfortunately captured on camera; something she wishes had never happened. It is not her behaviour which appalls me as much as society&rsquo;s treatment of it - using her unfortunate mistake as another platform for pseudo-feminist self-righteousness and another chance to take a swing at &lsquo;misogynist&rsquo; values. One has to wonder if the ultra-feminists care as much about the plight of this seventeen-year-old as they do about having another opportunity to stick the sexually liberated boot in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Underneath their &lsquo;outrage&rsquo; at the Slane Girl scandal, they relish the opportunity to once again bombard the media with their message - that men are the great big baddies of the world and that us poor girls shouldn&rsquo;t get blamed for anything\"</p>\n</blockquote>\r\nWe as a society are obsessed with feminism. We don&rsquo;t like to admit it, but we are, and I don&rsquo;t like what feminism has become. Feminism used to mean giving women choices and opportunities - the opportunity to cast their own votes, hold their own properties, to earn the same amount of money as men in the same level jobs. The choice to smash the glass ceiling in their chosen field or stay at home to raise children. But the ultra-feminists out there, who wish not to put women on an equal level as men but to raise them on a higher pedestal on which they can do no wrong, have begun to use feminism as nothing more than a scapegoat for behaviour which is immoral and quite frankly illegal.\r\n\r\nUnderneath their &lsquo;outrage&rsquo; at the Slane Girl scandal, they relish the opportunity to once again bombard the media with their message - that men are the great big baddies of the world and that us poor girls shouldn&rsquo;t get blamed for anything. Does that sound like gender equality to you?
