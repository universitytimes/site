If people reward charity by looking upon the individual more favourably, there is less &rsquo;social status&rsquo; to go around and less to be gained in other ways.

Basically: why bother trying to be the funniest guy in the class when Johnny Do-Gooder gets all the girls? Better to spend that time and effort elsewhere.</p>\n<p>So a philanthropic society that rewards altruism may end up being less funny, less smart, and more ugly than a self-interested Hobbsian wilderness.
