Alcohol flows more freely than on a wino&rsquo;s birthday, there is an abundance of new and interesting people to meet, and the thrill of finally being independent is a feeling difficult to even articulate. Yet in spite of the initial buzz of moving away for University, after a certain period of time a lull sets in. It may take a week, or two, or maybe even a month, but the inevitable strain of homesickness catches every first year student eventually.\n\n&nbsp;\nWhat exactly triggers this incredibly unpleasant sensation differs from person to person. Some, after quickly discovering that one or more of their new randomly assigned flat mates is an imbecile, miss the company of their friends or significant others. Others realise after their third failed effort of attempting to prepare an edible omlette that they severely require their mother&rsquo;s home cooking. And nearly all encounter distress at the foreign concept of washing their own clothes. The resultant feeling, however, is the same &ndash; an overwhelming desire to escape the alien surroundings to the warm and welcoming setting of your own home. This curious blend of nostalgia, boredom and loneliness is unquestionably common among freshman students, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop the upsetting feeling that nobody else quite gets it.\n\n&nbsp;\nHow you deal with this problem will largely shape the rest of your student life. A few people I knew last year decided that the best way of overcoming their blues was to stick it out in halls, enjoy the fun, and try and wait for the wistfulness to fade in time. You may take the opposite approach entirely and come to the conclusion that it isn&rsquo;t something you have to endure. One of my neighbours in the flat across from me opted to make a four-hour train journey home every Friday afternoon. Most decided that a fortnightly trip would suffice. The truth is that there isn&rsquo;t any correct way to combat homesickness. Some might say that you&rsquo;ll never truly experience independence unless you stick out those difficult winter weekends when halls are dead and the flat is a mess. But not everyone is able to cope with this sadness in the same way, and many find that the welcome sight of friends and family on a regular basis helps them get through the year. That being said, trains and buses can be expensive on a student budget, so be sure to be frugal with your money if you&rsquo;re planning on being a city-hopper.\n\n&nbsp;\nMissing home is one of the most common things that will happen to first year students, and it would be untrue to say that these feelings will be all but gone by second year. You will, however, have a much better idea of how best to deal with them. Foreign students have it somewhat harder, even though it should be noted that Christmas and summer holidays are significantly longer than they were at school. But if you do still live in Ireland, don&rsquo;t be afraid of travelling back every now and again for some freshly washed clothes and a well-cooked meal. After all, home is where the heart is.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "12406", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12404", "Heading": "There's No Place Like Home"}
