But the full picture is something much more complex, heavily laced with the influence of our colonial past. Generations of suffering, violence and neglect produced humour, mournful music and alcohol as crutches.

The Irish people<em>&nbsp;knew&nbsp;</em>that this was happening, had happened and would continue to happen in our country. And we let it go. We made it acceptable practice for large numbers of our elected officials, business leaders and public figures. The brown envelopes, the private islands, the offshore bank accounts, the dodgy planning deals, the tribunals; the book of Irish corruption would run into many volumes. And in the Celtic Tiger years we simply adapted this to a new set of institutions, making ourselves the Wild West of European finance and bringing the&nbsp;<em>slibh&iacute;n</em>&nbsp;into the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century with a three-piece suit, a briefcase and a tie clip.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">But the apathy, connivance and collusion that framed our political ideology particularly in the good times &ndash; when lone voices of dissent were cast off as begrudgers &ndash; is now playing a very different role.

Very few can claim a comprehensive knowledge but the lack of even a basic understanding of the factors and events that directly contributed to our failure is tangible. The hatred directed towards the fraudulent bankers, the fears about our bonds, vague discussions about regulation and the criticism of politicians have swirled around the less-than-vigorous national debate without anyone believing that the nation as a whole has a good grasp of what is happening.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Times;\">In the good times our apathy allowed us to accept a media that fed us the tranquilising drugs of superficiality and reassurance.
