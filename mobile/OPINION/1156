{"Body": "By Declan Harmon, University Times columnist\n\nI know of at least three Fianna F\u00e1il candidates who are warning voters on the doorsteps of the danger of Sinn F\u00e9in being the largest opposition party after the election. It would be easy to dismiss this as desperate spin from desperate candidates, but the facts suggest otherwise.\n\nThere are five factors which were crucial to Fianna F\u00e1il&rsquo;s success in the 1997, 2002 and 2007 elections:\n\n1)\u00a0\u00a0 A popular leader\n\n2)\u00a0\u00a0 A reputation for economic competence\n\n3)\u00a0\u00a0 Tight candidate selection strategy\n\n4)\u00a0\u00a0 Good vote management\n\n5)\u00a0\u00a0 An ability to attract transfers\n\nOther than the leadership, which has been resolved in the last three weeks, the other ingredients in the winning recipe are not present for Fianna F\u00e1il on this occasion.\n\nThe decline in the party&rsquo;s reputation for economic competence is obvious and does not require analysis.\n\nFianna F\u00e1il is running too many candidates. Don&rsquo;t take my word for it &ndash; it has been stated by Sean Donnelly, who previously advised Fianna F\u00e1il on polling and candidate strategy. As a result, a diminished share of the vote may end up being split between two candidates, with the result that both end up losing out.\n\nVote management has gone out the window, as every candidate seeks to maximise his or her own personal vote.\n\nFianna F\u00e1il was never a party that attracted transfers in large numbers from other parties or candidates. Voters tended to be either for or against Fianna F\u00e1il. The lack of transfers is part of the reason why Charles Haughey never achieved an overall majority, despite achieving over 45% of the vote in each election in which he led the party.\n\nBertie Ahern realised and recognised that, at a time when the Fianna F\u00e1il core vote was declining, he could use his own personal popularity to draw transfers from across the political spectrum. This contributed to Fianna F\u00e1il&rsquo;s &lsquo;seat bounce&rsquo;, where the party gained a higher proportion of seats than its share of the vote.\n\nFianna F\u00e1il is transfer toxic in this election and this could mean that the party suffers a reverse seat bounce, where its share of the seats declines disproportionately to its share of the vote. This is what happened to Fine Gael in its meltdown election in 2002, where it&rsquo;s share of seats fell from 32.5% in 1997 to 18.6% in 2002, while it&rsquo;s share of the vote only fell from 27.9% to 22.5%.\n\nIt is this factor that perhaps could prove most damaging to Fianna F\u00e1il in this election. It is also the factor that could benefit Sinn F\u00e9in most.\n\nWhen one looks at some of the top target seats for Sinn F\u00e9in in this election, the gains Sinn F\u00e9in are seeking are all at the expense of Fianna F\u00e1il:\n<ul>\n<li>Mary Lou McDonald - Dublin Central &ndash; seeking to unseat Fianna F\u00e1il&rsquo;s Cyprian Brady</li>\n<li>Dessie Ellis - Dublin North West &ndash; seat currently held by Fianna F\u00e1il&rsquo;s Pat Carey (Fianna F\u00e1il is guaranteed to lose at least one seat in this constituency, as it is only running one candidate following the retirement of Noel Ahern)</li>\n<li>Larry O&rsquo;Toole - Dublin North East &ndash; seat held by the retiring Michael Woods in the outgoing D\u00e1il</li>\n<li>Sean Crowe &ndash; Dublin South West &ndash; seeking to take one of the two seats Fianna F\u00e1il currently holds</li>\n<li>Peadar T\u00f3ib\u00edn &ndash; Meath West &ndash; Fianna F\u00e1il held two seats here in 2007, but is vulnerable following the retirement of Noel Dempsey</li>\n<li>Brian Stanley &ndash; Laois / Offaly &ndash; it is virtually certain that Fianna F\u00e1il will lose one seat here, following the retirement of Brian Cowen, the only question is which party will gain at Fianna F\u00e1il&rsquo;s expense</li>\n<li>Maurice Quinlivan &ndash; Limerick City &ndash; Fianna F\u00e1il&rsquo;s Peter Power is extremely vulnerable to the challenge from Quinlivan, who was famously defamed by Fianna F\u00e1il&rsquo;s other sitting TD in the constituency, Willie O&rsquo;Dea</li>\n<li>P\u00e1draig Mac Lochlainn - Donegal North East &ndash; Fianna F\u00e1il is guaranteed to be down one seat here from its 2007 total as it is only running one candidate</li>\n<li>David Cullinane &ndash; Waterford &ndash; Fianna F\u00e1il held two seats in Waterford in 2007 but is only running one candidate this time and Sinn F\u00e9in have a strong chance of picking up the extra seat.</li>\n</ul>\nSinn F\u00e9in also have an outside chance of taking a second seat in Cavan / Monaghan, with Caoimhgh\u00edn \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in bringing in a running mate.\n\nWhen one combines Fianna F\u00e1il&rsquo;s unpopularity, it&rsquo;s lack of ability to attract transfers, the potential for it to lose a disproportionate number of seats and the fact that Sinn F\u00e9in is likely to win many seats currently held by Fianna F\u00e1il, it becomes clear that it is far from impossible that Sinn F\u00e9in could overtake Fianna F\u00e1il to become the largest opposition party.", "Imageurl": "1175", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1156", "Heading": "It's not just spin, Gerry Adams could be leader of the opposition."}
