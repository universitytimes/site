Rolling marbles across a table, sitting on your mothers lap, the world may have been explained in a light different to your future classmates. Your mother maybe showed you how to play a marble game, perhaps she showed how the seemingly still light glints and shines atop the rolling glass sphere, perhaps she named them, painting a colourful story - or perhaps she pointed to them, naming each marble 1, then taking three marbles she named their collective 3 and removed a marble naming this new collective 2.\n\nA few years later you may have found yourself in the kindergarten being introduced to numbers and simple arithmetic. Because of your parent&rsquo;s interaction you have formed the subconscious ability to thrive in this new mathematical environment - or perhaps not. Perhaps you were the student sitting beside the maths wizz, unable to achieve that competency so easily, yet you better him or her in the literary arena being taught reading and writing from a young age. Or maybe you were the first to be picked for the football team to practice your valuable experience in the world of sports.\n<div>Mathematical competency is not an impossible wish for those who did not have a marble counting mother. Maths, like most subjects, is mastered through practice. In my own school I have witnessed the wizzes unwizzing and the wizzless being wizzified - purely on the basis of their practicing habits.</div>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>The Rising Tide</strong></span>\n\nWe live in a society drowning under useless information and commercial indulgence. With or without PISA and its sister-studies, it was and is evident that\u00a0 math scores will fall. Our thoughts are forced into the context of cheap media, lazy satisfaction and financial reasoning. There is hardly a sense of culture in Ireland&rsquo;s society of today - no awareness of the limits of human imagination, the expressions of sublime and intense beauty - we are simply being led through the shallow waters of statistical interpretation.\n\nIt has become overwhelmingly obvious that we as a society are unable to analyse statistics, yet politics government and industry are fueled by these measures. One has only to reach for a newspaper to find the reliance society has on these abstract figures. But it is not our ability to interpret statistical results which is of greatest concern, it is our assumption that these results should steer society. It is as if we have lost our intellectual independence - our ability to peer past the momentary facade of a problem and acknowledge the inherent truth. By the very nature of statistics they do not describe the truth, only approximate a measure that may be related to the truth.\n<div>The art of statistical analysis is however essential for scientific analysis - when married with the most basic principle of experimentation; change only one parameter with respect to the control. We do not have a replica of planet Earth and human civilisation to use as a control, but even if we did, the chaos of society would make it impossible to keep everything bar the parameter of interest constant. Either way statistics do not usually reveal the truth, but a shadow if it.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Even just one strict logical phenomenon in the world of physics, which can be isolated in a proper experimental environment, can take decades or even centuries of experimentation and critical analysis from the most prominent thinkers of our history before a true understanding is captured - and even then these truths are uncertain. And still it is not the statistical information which solely inspires this understanding, it takes an independent intellectual like Einstein, Heisenberg or Schroedinger\u00a0 to capture the light behind the shadow.</div>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>The Falling Blind</strong></span>\n\nThe Irish government is introducing a new second level mathematics curriculum named &lsquo;Project Maths&rsquo;. This is being done through the NCCA (National Council for Curriculum and Assessment) in response to the falling Irish second level maths competency, as implied by several international studies.\n<div>According to the project maths website,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.projectmaths.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">www.projectmaths.ie</a>:\n\n&ldquo;Project maths aims to provide for an enhanced student learning experience and greater levels of achievment for all. Much greater emphasis will be placed on student understanding of the mathematical concepts, with increased use of contexts and applications that will enable students to relate mathematics to everyday experiences.&rdquo;\n\nStudying a few sample questions I realised that the NCCA have a strange taste for context. The more interesting of these seemed to be easier versions of applied maths questions, another and rather excellent\u00a0 Leaving Certificate course. In fact the entire paper seemed to be a perverted, dumbed down, stats heavy version of the course I studied four years ago.</div>\nI recently had an <a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=8489\">article published </a>on the University Times website describing my impression of maths in society. A 6th year Leaving Certificate student responded:\n<div>&ldquo;Project Maths is akin to &lsquo;giving-in&rsquo; to an obsessive thought... in that we&rsquo;ve a national situation in which some students are not applying themselves and statistics show that teachers are insufficiently trained. This has lead to a simplified course which is being described as &lsquo;more student friendly and practical&rsquo; rather than the [Government] improving the national approach to and fear of maths.&rdquo;\n\nIn the same comment he describes the poor curriculum of project maths and his wish to learn the abstract concepts that &lsquo;real maths&rsquo; can offer. Contrary to the claim of the NCCA that higher level project maths is geared towards those who wish to study 3rd level mathematics, project maths contains the minimal amount of the pure maths studied at third level.\n\nThe focus of project maths is statistics, a skill which according to the NCCA &ldquo;...has a value far beyond mathematics wherever data is used as evidence to support argument.&rdquo; But statistical analysis wont reveal the real reason why Irish maths competency is falling - that the fundamental assumptions and culture of our society are becoming dictated by a commercial media, shallow politics and false government - this vision requires intellectual independence.</div>\nWe are allowing a confused culture influence a broken education system, we should be fighting for an honest education with the power to heal a confused culture. The irony is that the same problem which inspired this new curriculum makes it all the more difficult to see the problems and dangers of a cosmetic solution.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbFM3rn4ldo\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n<em>This article is the second installment of a series titled 'The Dying Animal'.
