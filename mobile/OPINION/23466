{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">As my final term in Trinity College grows nearer I have discovered that I am more enthusiastic about entering the tritely referenced &lsquo;Big Bad World.&rsquo; I have developed an emerging eagerness towards leaving, not only university, but from the Emerald Isle. This desire has arisen due to a growing indifference towards what has become the mundane. After spending many years here the characteristics that define this country as being Ireland have turned into dull traits. The regular surroundings of the city, the repetitious commute into college and the recurrent topics of conversation have left me with an appetite to experience other surroundings and cultures. I have begun to do what most individuals in my scenario would do: apply for everything that is available abroad - jobs, Masters programmes, internships, etc.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As I research and prepare applications for my hopeful departure from this shore I am struck by the fact that not one individual has stated that I am planning to &lsquo;emigrate&rsquo; but rather that I am &lsquo;going abroad&rsquo;. Despite the identical nature of the two acts a negative connotation has developed around Irish emigration.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">It is important to remember that emigration possesses an equally positive overtone as well</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For a long time the words &lsquo;necessity&rsquo; and &lsquo;employment&rsquo; have been associated with Irish emigration. While this association may be deemed reasonable given the nature of the Irish economy over the past century and the traditional foundation for the development of the Irish Diaspora, it is unhealthy for Irish people to label this act negatively. Some Irish have had no alternative but to explore abroad for their career development, but it is important to remember that emigration possesses an equally positive overtone as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While the premise for emigration is generally due to the need for employment, there is also the wonder of experiencing the unknown that comes with living in a new environment. I am not suggesting that people do not realise the benefits of living abroad permanently or temporarily, but individuals never equate the positive qualities of living abroad with the act of emigrating.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While articles in national newspapers tend to review emigration statistics with a degree of pessimism, they should also view them as a signal of the international opportunities being taken up by individuals to further their knowledge. In some cases this can be seen as a loss to the Irish nation, but most intend to return with their international education and foreign knowledge. While the general media and the national statistics will define us as &lsquo;emigrants&rsquo;, and thus, will insinuate that we are members of Ireland&rsquo;s lost generation, we will view ourselves as &lsquo;emigrants&rsquo; and members of Ireland&rsquo;s future generation.</p>\r\nA lyric from an American song has remained with me as I research and plan my voyage: &ldquo;If you never leave home, never let go, you&rsquo;ll never make it to the great unknown.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/USI_Knock-7.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23466", "Heading": "Redefining 'Emigration'"}
