{"Body": "<p>The results for the sabbatical team of 2010/2011 were announced on the February 18. &nbsp;The count was held in the Mont Clare Hotel on Merrion Square. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>First to be announced was Education, with Jen Fox deemed elected after reaching 3090 votes. Dave Preston, her contester, and a joke candidate, received a total of 418 votes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next to be announced was Communications, the only uncontested race, with Tom Lowe being declared winner over Reopen Nominations (Ron). Lowe received a total of 3084 votes, with RON getting just 495. These two elections were announced in quick concession, with the other races taking more time due to the fact that there were more votes to count as more people were running.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Welfare, which was the closest race in the whole election process, saw Steph Fleming deemed elected over the incumbent, Cormac Cashman. With a difference of just twenty votes between them, it was the closest race since 2007 when Nicholas Longworth beat Dave Byrne by just two votes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fleming, who only decided to run on the day nominations closed, ran a well-organized campaign, despite leaving it so late to assemble a campaign team. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The next race to be announced was Entertainments. Three candidates ran, Darragh Genockey, Keith Florea and Conor O&rsquo;Toole. Genockey was elected with a total of 2129 votes, surpassing the quota of 1789.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>O&rsquo;Toole, who claims to have run as a joke candidate, reached a very even 1000 votes, much to his liking. This race held no surprises as Genockey was the favourite from day one, yet O&rsquo;Toole did have his supporters, many of whom were anti-Bess or did not want another club promoter as Ents Officer. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The final race to be announced, and the most hotly contested, was that of President. Four candidates ran, Declan Harmon, Fearghal Hughes, Dan Reilly, and Nikolai Trigoub-Rotnem. &nbsp;Reilly, a joke candidate, was eliminated after the first count, with just 145 votes in his favour.</p>\n<p>However during the second week Trigoub-Rotnem appeared to have the lead, with growing support. Harmon, a non-union candidate was eliminated after the first count with 911 votes. Between Hughes and Trigoub Rotnem the second count saw further votes being transferred to Trigoub Rotnem, eventually being deemed elected after the third count with 1798 votes to Hughes&rsquo; 1515.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the two weeks candidates did their best to gain favour amongst the student body, with a few memorable stunts being pulled. Hughes for example had a flash mob and a human pyramid in the Arts Block, Trigoub-Rotnem had his manifesto advertised on the can-crusher outside the Pav, Fox had a fox costume, yet perhaps the most memorable was Genockey&rsquo;s Captain America&rsquo;s bus, in which he and his team arrived for the Halls hustings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fines were of course given out for these stunts and many other ploys which teams used to gain votes. &nbsp;Each candidate is allowed a total of 60 credits. If they surpass this number they would be struck from the ballot. The Electoral Commission has final decision on this, and throughout the election they oversee the fair running of all the races.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There was some controversy surrounding the supposed sending of an email in one of the races. One team is alleged to have sent an email out to first year science on their facebook page just an hour after campaigning began, which is not allowed under EC regulation.
