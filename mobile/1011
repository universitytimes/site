{"Body": "Eleni Megoran\n\nSS BESS\n\n<strong>Communications Officer</strong>\n\nEleni Megoran&rsquo;s decision to join the race for Communications may have been last minute but she&rsquo;s hardly unprepared. The 21 year old has some impressive experience under her belt, ranging from work in PR to internships with her local paper and the BBC, and believes she has the &ldquo;best qualifications for the job.&rdquo; The originally uncontested role of Communications Officer has some feisty competition, and she&rsquo;s not afraid of a bit of &ldquo;mud-slinging&rdquo; either.\n\nIn final year studying Political Science, Eleni is proving her editorial aptitude as the first ever female Sports Editor of Trinity News. She is also president of Trinity Lacrosse and plays for Ireland. Breaking more new ground, she became the first Sports Editor to make front page news, with her article revealing the lack of transparency in the allocation of &euro;1 million\u00a0of student funds by DUCAC, proving her confidence in exposing controversy within college administration. She is adamant about maintaining the editorial independence of the University Times and is also dedicated to building a relationship with the national media to ensure student issues are publicized on a national level.\n\nShe plans to encourage a culture of journalism in Trinity, through workshops with esteemed journalists and professionals, helping student writers perfect their skills. This, she believes, will further enhance the University Times and, most importantly, the quality of news coverage delivered to students.\n\nIn response to her competition, already well established in the University Times, Eleni claims &ldquo;I&rsquo;m different, fresh and creative, with a new perspective.&rdquo; She ensures &ldquo;no cliques&rdquo; and believes in making the paper more accessible to aspiring student writers, so as to provide a multiplicity of voices and fully represent the student body.\n\nIntent on &ldquo;bridging the gap between the SU and you&rdquo;, Eleni plans to improve transparency, setting up an online forum where students can voice their opinions on SU policies and developments. She plans to make information as quickly and easily accessible as possible through the SU and UT websites, with audio and video podcasts, as well as live tweets from SU meetings.\n\n&ldquo;I have the passion for it&rdquo;, Eleni ardently assures. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dedicated to producing a quality newspaper, but also to bringing student issues to a national level. I want to make sure that talent within the University Times, and college, is nurtured through workshops and seminars, by getting people from RT\u00c9, from the BBC, experts from the world of journalism, to help us make the paper the best it can be. It&rsquo;s important to nurture the established talent within the University Times, but also to encourage new and young talent through an open, meritocratic system that&rsquo;s not just about who you know, but devoted to finding the right people for the right job.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "1025", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1011", "Heading": "SU ELECTION CANDIDATE: Eleni Megoran"}
