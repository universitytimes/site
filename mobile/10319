{"Body": "Below is a statement from Ents Officer Chris O'Connor in which he gives an explanation for the cancellations of two Trinity Ball acts, Marina and the Diamonds and Labrinth.\n<blockquote>Once again we wish to apologise for the unforeseen circumstances that have led to the withdrawal of Marina &amp; The Diamonds and Labrinth from the Trinity Ball 2012 Line-up. Please note that it was by no means easy for us to have heard of these withdrawals knowing that people might be let down. These are events which were completely out of our control.\n\nWith regards to the comments on the note we can only say what we know and we always strive to inform the students of what is happening at all times. What we know is this:\n\nAfter seeing her ENT (Ear Nose Throat) specialist this afternoon Marina has been ordered on full vocal rest for one week. In light of this, she regretfully had to cancel the Dublin Trinity Ball show on Friday. Marina would like to apologize to her fans and all involved in putting on the show, she promises to return to Dublin as soon as she can. She recently tweeted her hope to make up for this in some way in the not too distant future.\n\nLabrinth was forced to cancel his appearance at the ball due to scheduling issues which arose following his already agreed performance at the ball. Having recently been selected to support Drake on his Tour he was posed with a conflict of interests. While it was hoped that this would be resolved by him being able to perform both shows on the same night (Birmingham support to Drake followed by the Trinity Ball), we were informed this morning that this is impossible. Labrinth was equally disappointed to let down his fans who were eager to see him perform at the Trinity Ball.\n\nWith limited time replace the acts we worked tirelessly to find a top quality act to replace those who cancelled. Luckily we managed to secure The Coronas at very short notice who are massively popular amongst students in Ireland. Following their sold out performance in Marlay Park and their impressive six night stint at The Olympia Theatre, Dublin last December, They are also set to headline a show in the O2 this coming December. We have done our very best to live-up to the standard of acts which have withdrawn and we were delighted to secure The Coronas as a replacement who are one of the top Irish acts.\n\nWith regards the other questions we will work hard to seek answers for you in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Trinity Ball is a very special occasion every year and we hope that each and every one of the attendees this year has a fantastic night. We have a brilliant line-up this year which is unrivaled by any University ball in Ireland once again.\n\nAfter a hectic day at the office I hope this answers as many questions as possible. Apologies for the delay in getting back to you all and I hope that this answers some questions at least.\n\nEnjoy the ball. I hope you all have a blast and a memorable night.\n\nChris O'Connor\nTrinity Ents Officer 2011/2012</blockquote>", "Imageurl": "10320", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10319", "Heading": "Statement from Ents regarding Trinity Ball act cancellations"}
