As predicted by many, the Dutch defence proved\u00a0 their incompetence at the highest level against the admittedly lucky Danish. Elsewhere, although far from perfect, Germany&rsquo;s class prevailed as they edged a tense opener against a Portuguese side whose big names once more failed to live up to their potential. The old adage concerning a team being more than the sum of its parts has seemingly been forgotten in Portugal, many of them seem to think that there is only one, tall, greasy part to their team. Ronaldo aside, Portugal, like Holland had a lot to do going into the second round of games.\n\n<strong>Portugal 3 - 2 Denmark </strong>\n\nThis one was a real thriller. Like in many memorable games, bad defending dominated and space was aplenty. An attacking mindset that would have Trap squirming in his seat afforded left gaps at the back and gave both sides a bucket of goal-scoring opportunities. Few, if any, predicted anything but slaughter for the Danish when they were drawn in the so-called &lsquo;Group of Death&rsquo;. However they seem to have drawn on a combination of old Nordic fighting spirit and the element of surprise, as well as a solid, well balanced squad, to emerge as potential qualifiers from Group 2. Their qualification hopes have taken a dent after this loss, but they are very much still in the hunt. Competent finishing from Pepe and Helger Postiga seemed to have put the game beyond doubt, until Nicklas Bendtner&rsquo;s brace of goals almost earned the Danes a famous point. It wasn&rsquo;t to be though, Silvestre Valera&rsquo;s fluid finish won the game for Portugal, meaning that if Denmark are to qualify they will have to do it the hard way.\n\nArguably the most entertaining of the tournament thus far, this game threw up a number of talking points, many of which centred around a familiar topic; the performance of Cristiano Ronaldo. Or, more aptly, the non-performance of Cristiano Ronaldo. Although his face filled a large proportion of the breaks in play, Ronaldo&rsquo;s in-game activities were far less appealing. There is no more ardent admirer of CR7 at his flowing best than this writer, however it has to be said that he has been severely lacking in the opening two games of the Euros. Although his disgraceful attitude to defending is lamentable, it is accepted because of his devastating attacking play and match-winning ability. When this attacking threat is misfiring, the Real Madrid star is nothing more than a petulant child. Ronaldo wasted a ridiculous amount of opportunities against Denmark and even tried his best to prevent Varela from winning it instead.\n\nTherefore, without the golden boy strutting his stuff, there was a noticeable void and a number of players did their best to fill it. Bendtner, despite his inability to keep the ball in the stadium while playing for Arsenal, has a commendable record for his country, one which he boosted to 20 goals in 50 games with two headers in this game. Varela was lively when he came on and Postiga surprised many with a very smooth finish that left keeper Anderson had no hope of saving. All in all, an entertaining game that blew Group 2 wide open.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Holland 1 - 2 Germany</strong>\n\nAs predicted by the <em>University Times</em>, Mario Gomez&rsquo;s goals have proved the difference between Germany and the rest so far in this tournament. The big Bayern striker nailed two penultimate nails in the Dutch Euro coffin to add to the sublime header he scored against Portugal, it remains to be seen whether or not they can resurrect themselves against Denmark in round 3. It does not look likely. In contrast to the thoroughbred German performance, the Dutch were ragged and tetchy. Van Persie was ineffectual, comparable even to Ronaldo until he scored a beautiful, drilled right-footer in the second half. Schweinsteiger, another <em>UT </em>pick, was imperious, assisting both of Gomez&rsquo;s goals and running the midfield area with aplomb. Germany have so far slipped through the Group of Death unharmed and were never really threatened once they went ahead. Germany coach Joachim Low must surely be expecting to see his side to progress. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve taken a major step and opened the door to the quarter-finals,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Now we have our destiny in our own hands.&rsquo;\n\nCertainly last night Germany looked like a team that will only get better. They might have had a problem had Van Persie taken one of two early chances. But the first &mdash; a volley when a pass from Mark van Bommel dropped over his shoulder &mdash; and the second &mdash; a shot on the run from a Robben pass &mdash; never looked like beating Manuel Neuer. From that point, Germany managed to take hold of the game. The standard of goals matched the standard of players on the pitch, each of the three was worthy of winning any game, it just happened that the Oranje did little else worthwhile. Reports of the now traditional infighting in the Dutch camp during the week manifested during the game; Robben didn&rsquo;t take being substituted kindly, while both Sneijder and Van der Vaart supplied their customary pettiness to proceedings. Although the Germans were superior, the Dutch did show some fighting spirit, particularly in the second half. Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk shook up his attack after the break by bringing on Tottenham Hotspur's Rafael van der Vaart for captain Mark van Bommel and Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for Barcelona's Ibrahim Afellay.\n\nThe Oranje upped the pace and created several chances before Van Persie put them back in the game when he turned Germany defender Mats Hummels to fire an unstoppable shot past Manuel Neuer's left hand. It wasn&rsquo;t to be though, and Holland are left with it all to do next on Sunday evening. In contrast, Low&rsquo;s team can afford a draw against the plucky Danes and still top the group.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn tonight&rsquo;s games Croatia take on Italy, while Ireland go to battle with reigning World and European Champions, Spain, in a must win tie.", "Imageurl": "10903", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10902", "Heading": "Euro 2012: Germany safe, Holland, not so much"}
