{"Body": "<strong>Conor Bates |\u00a0</strong>Sports Editor\r\n\r\nTrinity&rsquo;s senior men&rsquo;s footballers take to the field against IT Blanchardstown tomorrow in an effort to kickstart their stalling season. The forerunners of the GAA club will need a win over their Dublin rivals, as they have succumbed to two losses in their opening two fixtures. The situation is somewhat reminiscent of last year&rsquo;s league campaign, in which Trinity won a relegation playoff to maintain their Division 1 status. A victory against Blanchardstown will go a long way to preventing a similar scenario in this campaign.\r\n\r\nDespite suffering two defeats, the signs have not been all negative for Trinity. Aside from a comprehensive beating from DCU, the team played remarkably well against reigning Sigerson Cup champions, DIT, losing by only four points at the final whistle, 0-18 to 0-14. Blanchardstown could be the game which will help the footballers turn their season around, as the west Dublin college are also yet to win this year.\r\n\r\nPositive signs are also emanating from other echelons of the GAA club, notably the men&rsquo;s intermediate team, who recorded a 7-9 to 2-5 win over NCI. The inters now take on Carlow, in Carlow, on Thursday, to bolster their league position.\r\n\r\nFor the last few years, the fresher&rsquo;s teams have carried a great amount of potential in the college, and have won notable successes for the club. While last year was a great year for the fresher&rsquo;s footballers, this year appears to be the year of the hurler, with the college team putting Queen&rsquo;s University to the sword in their opening match, 3-15 to 2-13. They play Jordanstown's freshers this evening.\r\n\r\nThe fresher&rsquo;s footballers are also in Division 2, but have as of yet, only played one game. On that occasion they were bested by St. Patrick&rsquo;s College, but with a number of games in hand there is still a lot of football to be played for them this year.\r\n\r\nThe senior camogie team and senior hurlers took to the field in a double header last week, both matches being played against St. Mary&rsquo;s. The cam\u00f3gs were narrowly defeated on the evening, while the hurlers walked away with a hard fought win, 3-5 to 0-9. The hurlers made up for their opening loss to Queen&rsquo;s University with this win, and have only table-topping Jordanstown left to face in their Division 2 group. The two senior hurling teams meet on Thursday.\r\n\r\nWhile the overall picture for the club is mixed at the moment, there is no doubt that the positive aspects of the league campaigns will be taken into the new year, when the Championship draws are made.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Trinity-Hurling.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21535", "Heading": "GAA League Roundup"}
