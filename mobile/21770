{"Body": "<strong>Hannah Ryan\u00a0</strong>| News Editor\r\n\r\nCollege has withdrawn a legal threat made against The Trinity College Dublin War Memorial Project, a campaign to commemorate the Trinity alumni who fought and died in World War Two. A solicitor's letter was sent from the college to the project last week, concerning its\u00a0use of Trinity's name - a registered trademark - and unsolicited correspondence sent to the provost by campaigners.\r\n\r\nThe campaign temporarily changed its name to \"The University War Memorial Project\" but the coordinator of the project, Peter Mulvany, asserted that he was the legal owner of the website address tcdwarmemorialproject.com, and so refused to remove the domain.\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">&ldquo;Trinity takes very seriously the role that many of our former students and staff have played in key events in the past, including in conflicts.\"</blockquote>\r\nHowever, last night Provost Patrick Prendergast gave the campaigners permission to use the names \"TCD\" and \"Trinity College Dublin\" for promotional purposes.\r\n\r\nA statement issued to <em>The Irish Times\u00a0</em>on behalf of the university said that this decision came as a recognition of the difference between the use of Trinity's name for \"public interest causes\" and its use for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Trinity takes very seriously the role that many of our former students and staff have played in key events in the past, including in conflicts,&rdquo; the statement continued.\u00a0&ldquo;In the front square of Trinity, there is a hall of honour bearing the names of all those Trinity staff and students who lost their lives in the first World War.\"\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\"It&rsquo;s a marvellous breakthrough. I respect the provost for making this step.\"</blockquote>\r\n\"How best to remember those who died in wars was a matter of considerable public debate after the second World War. That debate continues today.\u00a0As an academic institution, Trinity believes that public debate on these matters is both worthwhile and important, and we are very open to suggestions on ways in which we should remember the role of those who died in conflicts, including people connected to the university who fought in the second World War.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nMulvany announced his delight at the college's decision, stating: \"It&rsquo;s a marvellous breakthrough. I respect the provost for making this step. It is great to see that Trinity is prepared to take a lead on these issues.\"\r\n\r\nThe website calls on people to submit a petition to the provost requesting that a statue be erected on Trinity's grounds in memory of those who died in the war.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/tcdmem.png", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21770", "Heading": "College Withdraws Legal Threat Over War Memorial Campaign"}
