{"Body": "<p>Societies were in disarray in the run-up to Freshers&rsquo; Week as College authorities blocked the mailing of some flyers, brochures and adverts by student societies to incoming Freshers.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">An argument over the fees charged by The Hist to Law Soc, who were ultimately excluded, got nasty on Friday of last week, with fiery Law Soc Auditor Grace O&rsquo;Malley threatening to sue the Hist over the &euro;300 charged.
