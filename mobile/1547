{"Body": "Congratulations to the five Sabbatical Officers elected on Thursday night. I know some better than others, but having met all of them during the campaign I am confident that they all have the capacity to do a good job for the students of Trinity next year.\n\nCommiserations to those that lost out. I know your pain! It may be some consolation to know that any of the good ideas in your manifestos will probably be implemented anyway and those that are not will almost certainly feature in the manifestos of next year's candidates!\n\nThis will be my last involvement with TCDSU elections. My record is pretty grim. Of the three campaigns I have been involved in (my own presidential campaign and the two campaigns I advised this year), all have lost. Amidst all the other worries of election time, at least prospective candidates next year will not have to worry about me offering to help them!", "Imageurl": "1557", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1547", "Heading": "Never mind the Curse of Cathal Horan, beware of the Curse of Declan Harmon"}
