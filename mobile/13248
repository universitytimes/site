And with getting up in the dark and going home in the dark comes the cold bite of November and early Christmas lights on Grafton Street. Well. There&rsquo;s only one thing to do, and that&rsquo;s go home and burn up under a blanket. Or, you could head to down to your nearest society room and learn something new. Here&rsquo;s my list of the top five societies to check out for those days when you&rsquo;re feeling the winter chill and need to do something about it. From taking pics of wintery trees to ditching stress for a bit of meditation, there&rsquo;s something for every cold-weather-clam to enjoy.\n\n<strong>1. Knit Soc</strong>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/13/5-societies-to-beat-the-winter-blues/knit-soc-old/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13256\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13256\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/knit-soc-old3.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"160\" height=\"160\" /></a>\n\nAn obvious choice for the months when you&rsquo;ll be wearing sweaters and cardis, whether you want to or not. Head to knit soc for your weekly dose of stitching and bitching, and who knows, you could be walking around with your own Ravenclaw-imitation scarf before you can say Advent calendar.\n\n<em>Where?</em> The Eliz Rooms, House Six.\n\n<em>Why? </em>Because knitting is cheaper than shopping.\n\n<em>What?</em> Weekly Stitching and Bitching sessions. They even made little hats for Smoothies (you know the ones). That&rsquo;s cool.\n\n<em>Who?</em> For a society that states its products on Facebook as &lsquo;enthusiasm&rsquo;, I think you can expect suitably bubbly knit folk.\n\n<strong>2.\u00a0Film Soc</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/13/5-societies-to-beat-the-winter-blues/du-film/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13250\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-13250\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/DU-film3-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" /></a></p>\nWinter can be slightly boring. You&rsquo;ve got essays, you&rsquo;ve got Schols, you&rsquo;ve got whatever you&rsquo;re having yourself. If you want some entertainment head over to the lovely chaps at DU Film and get involved. If nothing else, editing a film or writing a script will give you an excuse to stay inside all day with your &lsquo;creativity&rsquo; and hot chocolate. Win-win situation.\n\n<em>Where?</em> House Six.\n\n<em>Why?</em> Because filming is better than watching.\n\n<em>What?</em> Submissions for scripts have just closed but you can still get involved with the productions when they start production. If you fancy styling your first movie on another one, there&rsquo;s always next month&rsquo;s Be Kind Rewind in association with Players. The deadline to submit a 60 second script based on any film you like is the 14th of November. Get copycatting.\n\n<em>Who?</em> Pick your own team and borrow a camera. Easy as.\n\n<strong>3.\u00a0Meditation Soc/Yoga Soc</strong>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/13/5-societies-to-beat-the-winter-blues/yoga/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13251\"><img class=\"wp-image-13251 alignnone\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/yoga3-239x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"143\" height=\"180\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/13/5-societies-to-beat-the-winter-blues/meditation/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13252\"><img class=\"wp-image-13252 alignnone\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/meditation3-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"143\" height=\"143\" /></a>\n\nSometimes running around in the cold just isn&rsquo;t an option. For those times, there&rsquo;s always Yoga Society, or the Meditation Soc. Besides the fact that they operate inside (phew!), they offer a little bit of calm during a time when there&rsquo;s always another deadline looming. Perfect for November, then.\n\n<em>Where?</em> Check out their Facebook pages for details on when and where you can get your yoga/meditation fix. On the Yoga page they&rsquo;ve got loads of wholesome winter recipes and the odd quirky pic, too. Cool.\n\n<em>Why?</em> Because everyone can do with a winter destressing.\n\n<em>What?</em> Yoga offers Pilates and loads of different types of yoga, some incorporating music. That&rsquo;s nice. Meditation offers Tai Chi, too. Very international.\n\n<em>Who?</em> Beginners, intermediates, and anyone who fancies a go.\n\n<strong>4. DUPA</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/13/5-societies-to-beat-the-winter-blues/dupa/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13253\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-13253\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/dupa3-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"144\" height=\"144\" /></a></p>\nPhotography might not seem like an obvious option, but then again, winter photography is practically an entire genre of its own (note: this has not been verified by anybody remotely involved with photography). Anyway. As if being involved with Fashion Soc&rsquo;s upcoming show wasn&rsquo;t enough, DUPA are running various workshops over the next two months to help you get that perfect Christmas shot.\n\n<em>Where?</em> Check out their Facebook page for details on events.\n\n<em>Why?</em> Because taking pictures in the cold is better than freezing in it.\n\n<em>What?</em> Free masterclasses, exhibitions, and photoshoots. The next masterclass is all about getting to grips with digital photography, and the deadline for submissions to the next exhibition is Friday November 9th. So get snapping. That&rsquo;s a sure way to keep wintery blues at bay.\n\n<em>Who?</em> Nice people who take pics. Not the paparazzi.\n\n<strong>And... one to watch:\n</strong><strong>5. ScanSoc</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/13/5-societies-to-beat-the-winter-blues/real-scan-soc/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13254\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-13254\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/real-scan-soc3-212x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"127\" height=\"180\" /></a></p>\nWhat better way to get into winter than with the Scandinavian Society? They listen to Norwegian bands at Whelan&rsquo;s! (November 14th - it&rsquo;s happening). They watch Scandinavian movies called Troll Hunter! (GMB, in October) They had a Halloween freaky fest! That&rsquo;s good enough evidence that these kids will come into their own come late November. Last December saw them take a trip to IKEA. That&rsquo;s the kind of awesomeness I&rsquo;m talking about.\n\n<em>Where?</em> House Six, but check the Facebook for events.\n\n<em>Why?</em> Because you don&rsquo;t have to be Scandinavian to make winter your own.\n\n<em>What?</em> Quirky events, like band-supporting and IKEA-shopping.\n\n<em>Who?</em> People who just love the Scan culture. It could be you.\n\nIf you want more information on any of these societies, Facebook is your go-to solution. And if you want to get involved with any of the events, a quick email or even just a look into their rooms will sort you out.", "Imageurl": "13249", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13248", "Heading": "5 Societies To Beat The Winter Blues"}
