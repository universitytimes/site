{"Body": "<strong>Una Kelly</strong> | Online News Editor\n\nThe second annual LGBT Hustings for SU candidates took place on Wednesday evening in a packed Thomas Davis theatre. Introduced last year, the event provides an opportunity for candidates to discuss their policies specifically relating to LGBT issues facing students. The format, differing from the traditional Dining Hall Hustings, was a question and answer session moderated by former Q Soc auditor David Doyle.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_14802\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/02/07/candidates-perform-strongly-at-lgbt-hustings/education/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14802\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-14802\" title=\"education\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/education3-300x198.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"198\" /></a> Education candidates take questions at last night's LGBT hustings. Photo: Owen Bennett[/caption]\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>President</strong></h3>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">If elected, how do the candidates see their role in relation to LGBT issues?\u00a0</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Lylas Aljohmani spoke about the enthusiasm that already exists in the relationship between the SU and Q Soc and that she would like to see the society have a deeper involvement with the SU if they wish it.</span>\n\nRosa Langhammer said she would focus on campaigns, particularly Trans-awareness and ensure that there is equality throughout SU policy.\n\nTom Lenihan emphasised that there is all too often still a stigma attached to LGBT issues and that the President must address this. He pointed out that many students who &lsquo;come out&rsquo; may suffer &lsquo;minority stress&rsquo; and be more prone to mental health problems. He would like to work with the Ents officer to create gay nights out that are publicised in the weekly college-wide SU email.\n\nShould the SU have policies on such divisive issues as civil marriage rights?\n\nAljohmani believes it is a person&rsquo;s inherent right to marry whoever they chose and that SU officers should continue campaigning for it. She pointed out that the SU must consider how they can have influence on a national scale and that throughout history change was often instigated by students.\n\nLanghammer said she would work on getting the college behind SU policies and that she would work with other student unions in Ireland to create a national agenda on marriage equality.\nTom echoed the other candidates when he asserted his belief that everyone should have the right to marry who they want, and joked that the college chapel could be a real &lsquo;cash cow&rsquo; if allowed to host civil weddings.\n\nWhat are the candidates&rsquo; opinions on the SU gender referendum which will be held alongside elections?\n\nRosa believes it is necessary to bring it into SU policy but questioned if now was indeed the right time for it, since the importance of the issue may be lost among the sabbatical elections.\n\nLylas questioned if the wider student body understood the issues in the referendum and would like in the future to have more opportunities for students to have conversations with members of Q Soc.\n\nTom hopes for a good turnout in the referendum and believes it will pass, but also that we should not over-celebrate it, as it is only a first step.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Education and Welfare</strong></h3>\nSince Stephen Garry is the sole candidate in the Welfare race he took his questions alongside the Education hopefuls.\n\nHow do the candidates see their role in relation to LGBT issues?\n\nStephen Garry pointed out the relevant policies already existing in his campaign. He would like to run a &lsquo;Labels are not for people&rsquo; campaign, an Equality Week, build upon the Union&rsquo;s strong links to Q Soc and ensure that those people working in the JCR and peer mentoring service in Halls are educated and supported in their dealing with relevant issues.\n\nJohn Curtin would like to run a relevant Education clinic in Trinity Halls and brought up the point that students are still part of the Union when they are studying abroad. He would like to see these students supported more, and would work with the international office to help LGBT students in their choice of which foreign cities to study in.\n\nJack Leahy has produced a specific manifesto with regard to LGBT issues and pointed out issues the Union will have to overcome, such as gender neutral bathrooms. He believes students must also be informed on workplace discrimination and best practice codes so they are educated in this respect when they leave college.\n\nEric Tebay mentioned the personal self-acceptance he found in Q Soc and said he would use his position to tirelessly promote any and all LGBT issues as college should be a place of acceptance.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ents</strong></h3>\nConor &lsquo;Shmeesh&rsquo; Gleeson declined to attend the LGBT Hustings as he believed it would not be appropriate. However, if his campaign becomes more serious by Friday he will gladly sit down and be grilled on the issues by moderator David Doyle.\n\nCameron McCauley said he was &ldquo;vehemently opposed&rdquo; to Q Soc as he could not believe any society could promote queues. His response was received with laughter from the audience as he went on to question what the state of the family would be if people were queuing all over the place. He has an issue with &lsquo;Rainbow Week&rsquo; as he feels there should be a week that focuses on LGBT issues and not spent looking at rainbows.\n\nCian Mulville said he would create LGBT nights out involving all the colleges in Dublin and that he has already spoken to DIT about this.\nSean Reynolds said he would also create at least monthly nights out in collaboration with Q Soc to ensure that college is as inclusive as it can be. He would create a specific Ents committee for Rainbow Week.\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Communications</strong></h3>\nLeanna Byrne said she would produce University Times supplements relevant to LGBT issues written by students who identify themselves as such, and mentioned that contributors and editors must be well versed in the issues and language surrounding LGBT debates. She wants to introduce an interactive calendar which could highlight Q Soc events. In her role as Communications officer she would facilitate debate and ensure that UT remains professional, balanced and fair regardless of the issues. Byrne also pointed out that when surveys are taken students should not have to identify themselves as a specific gender.\n\nTommy Gavin highlighted the disconnect he feels exists between the SU and students and would work on correcting this as the Communications officer leads on social issues. He wants to implement a message board where students can have a say on SU policy, which would force the Union to reconsider whether or not policies have the support of the student body.\nRicky McCormack feels LGBT issues are the main issues of our generation and that the communications officer should constantly be putting out relevant information. He said UT should highlight the thriving diverse community in Trinity and question whether certain stances are just hate speech or adding to discourse.\n\nMatthew Taylor began by stating that LGBT acceptance is often taken for granted in Trinity, while in wider society it is usually only tolerated. In his role he would continue to strive for acceptance and would not shirk controversy as editor of UT. Commenting on a particular controversial article on gay marriage which he chose to publish last September, he said his reasons were because he believes the newspaper has a duty to expose ignorance and that he felt the writer&rsquo;s intention had the opposite effect, in that it was the best argument for gay marriage he had ever read.", "Imageurl": "14802", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14801", "Heading": "Candidates Perform Strongly at LGBT Hustings"}
