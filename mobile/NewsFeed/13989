{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Colm O'Donnell</strong> | Features Editor</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By now most of you are probably aware of the accident in which a man was struck by a Dublin Bus after he was pushed or fell onto the road following an altercation with two other people, both of whom fled the scene following the incident. The incident occurred on Thursday evening at around 5.45pm at the junction of Nassau street and Dawson street. The entire area was cordoned off as the Gardai conducted a full forensic examination of the scene. Traffic diversions were in place until Friday morning and the Trinity Nassau Street entrance was closed for several hours while Gardai examined the scene.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The man was identified following the release of a detailed description of him. He died having suffered severe head injuries after falling under a number 145 bus en route from Kilmacanogue to Heuston Station. The driver and passengers were treated for shock following the incident.</p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13990\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"510\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/12/11/shock-as-man-killed-on-trinitys-doorstep/dsc_0058/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13990\"><img class=\" wp-image-13990     \" title=\"DSC_0058\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/DSC_00583.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"510\" height=\"338\" /></a> The intersection of Dawson street and Nassau street, where the incident occurred.

He appeared in court number one at the criminal courts of justice on Parkgate street yesterday at 10:30am.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gardai are still appealing for anyone who witnessed the event to come forward and help their investigation and you can do so by phoning Pearse Street Garda station on 01-666-900.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ciar\u00e1n Nolan, a third-year student of Business, Economics, and Social Studies (BESS) was one of a number of Trinity students who were in the immediate surroundings of the incident when it occurred. He spoke to The University Times about his experience of the incident:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&lsquo;Myself and friends were sitting for coffee in Insomnia when we heard the commotion outside with fire engines, ambulances and guards etc all outside. The scene was a bit crazy, really chaotic I think the guards were shocked at the scene themselves and naturally it took a few minutes to get everything under control.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&lsquo;Everyone around was visibly upset and the street was really like a scene from a horrible horror movie, something you would never actually expect to see acted out in real life in the day time. I suppose like everyone else, myself and friends felt quite traumatised by the whole thing, it was a horrible thing to have to see and to see so many adults and especially children in such shocked states.</p>\n&lsquo;Literally a few minutes later Trinity security came outside and ushered many people in off the street, it was like something from Titanic trying to get into the grounds before the gates were closed.&rsquo;", "Imageurl": "13990", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13989", "Heading": "Shock as Man Killed on Trinity's Doorstep"}
