Leader Pelosi will deliver an address entitled &ldquo;E Pluribus Unum - Out of Many, One&rdquo; as part of the first Phil Inaugural Ceremony since 2006, when it hosted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Her address will focus on the democratic traditions and ideals shared by the United States and Ireland. Leader Pelosi is set to accept the Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage for her excellence in public life and outstanding contribution to politics.\n\nLeader Pelosi was the highest ranking female politician in American history when she served as 60th Speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011, during which time she helped to spearhead the early legislative efforts of President Obama. Her most notable legislative achievement as Speaker was the passing of Obama&rsquo;s health care legislation which is set to increase insurance coverage to over 30 million Americans and increase coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nSpeaking about how Leader Pelosi&rsquo;s visit came about, Phil President Eoin \u00d3&rsquo;Liath\u00e1in said, &ldquo;The Phil sent the invite to Leader Pelosi's office in the summer of 2011. We were delighted to receive her acceptance letter and have over the last few months been liaising with her staff in preparation for the visit.&rdquo;\n\nThe visit of a politician of Leader Pelosi&rsquo;s stature naturally raises some security concerns. \u00d3&rsquo;Liath\u00e1in said that &ldquo;the Phil has had many meetings with college officials about security concerns. We are currently working together to ensure everything goes as planned.&rdquo;\nPlanned events for the day include a tour of the college for Leader Pelosi and her delegation. This will be followed by a lunch in the College dining hall, with a string quartet from Trinity Orchestra setting the mood. Students representing a cross section of student life will be in attendance at this.\n\nLeader Pelosi will then meet with the Taoiseach in the evening, returning at Trinity at 7pm for her key note address.\n\nDetails of Leader Pelosi&rsquo;s entourage: There will be 27 people, including eight congressmen, four secret service men, a doctor and attending staff.\nDemocratic Leader, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-CA-08)\nMr. Paul Pelosi\nRep.
