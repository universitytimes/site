{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Documents obtained by <em>The University Times</em> indicate that the recommendations made by the mid-term review team, Profs. Luc Weber and Sybille Reichert, in regards to College restructuring will not be implemented.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">College began an academic restructuring process midway through the last decade. This resulted in a series of new academic structures being put in place by September of 2008. As promised at the time that these structures were introduced, a mid-term review was conducted to &ldquo;provide an independent evaluation of [their] effectiveness&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The review was preceded by a damning internal academic survey, published by <em>The University Times</em> after attempts at suppression by College, which showed high levels of dissatisfaction with the new structures and the process of restructuring which had put them in place.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The findings of the report were also critical. In its analysis it pointed to widespread inefficiency, poor communication, an overly centralised and &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; system of governance, poorly constructed executive job descriptions and serious flaws in the new structures which made them incapable of achieving the goals for which they were created.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The report also made a series of recommendations, which it summarised under twelve headings relating to the areas where changes were needed. These were: multi-disciplinary schools, faculties, the Heads of schools forum and Council, Vice-Provost and other annual officers, Chief Operating Officer, revised resource allocation model, strategy development, central administration, role of the Provost, information system, planning the re-launch of the reforms and communication.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">These findings were presented to the Board over two meetings on June 30th and July 2nd, 2010. The Provost, in a recent e-mail to staff about the report on restructuring, said that the Board &ldquo;accepted the overall thrust of the reviewers&rsquo; recommendations&rdquo;. Board meeting minutes from the two days indicate an acceptance of both the analysis and the recommendations by Board members, with only one person expressing strong reservations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In response to the report the Board established a Review Taskforce to consider in particular the recommendations made. This Taskforce contained two members of the Steering Committee which had conducted the aforementioned academic survey and brought in the mid-term review team, Prof. John McGilp and Academic Secretary Ms. Patricia Callaghan. The other members were Prof. David Singleton&nbsp;</span>as Chair, Profs. John Parnell and Dermot Kelleher as heads of multidisciplinary schools and Dr. Howard Smith as head of a single discipline school.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">This Review Taskforce ruled out &ldquo;implementing any further substantial structural changes&rdquo; reasoning that there was &ldquo;little appetite in College&rdquo; and a &ldquo;growing financial crisis&rdquo;. This meant, they said, that &ldquo;the risk of implementing [these substantial changes]&hellip; far outweighs the risk associated with modifying the current faculty-school structure&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">These structural changes were considered significant enough by both the mid-term review team and the Review Taskforce to make them the first and by far the largest sections of their reports.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The initial report had recommended that &ldquo;all schools with one only subject and under 40 academic staff should look for the most promising partner&hellip; within a maximum of three months&rdquo; for amalgamation into multidisciplinary schools. Various incentives were suggested to facilitate this process but &ldquo;where no agreement can be found&rdquo; it recommended that &ldquo;TCD leadership should decide on the school formation&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The end date for the maximum length of time for this process, counting from the submission of the report to the Board, would have been the beginning of October. The recommendations of the report continued that &ldquo;at the same time as new merged schools are formed, the faculties should be disbanded.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Review Taskforce considered four possible scenarios changes to the school-faculty structure. In descending order of degree of change they were: &ldquo;flat structure of 24 schools, 7-8 faculty structure, modified faculty-school structure and status quo&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Taskforce did not accept &ldquo;the recommendation that College should move quickly to establish&hellip; a small number of multidisciplinary schools.&rdquo; While it accepted that the recommended structure &ldquo;had its merits&rdquo;, it felt that &ldquo;given the current state of morale in the institution&hellip; any attempt to impose a policy coercively would be seriously damaging&rdquo;. It also described the costs involved as &ldquo;prohibitive&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Taskforce suggested instead the option to &ldquo;modify the faculty-school structure&rdquo;. While describing the problems highlighted in the analysis of the original report as &ldquo;tangible&rdquo; and an &ldquo;impediment to good governance&rdquo;, it felt that these could be dealt with as effectively by a modification of existing structures as any further restructuring.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Taskforce departed less from the original report&rsquo;s recommendations on the reorganisation in the Research Committee and schools in the Faculty of Health Sciences. It also endorsed the recommendation that the Vice-Provost should &ldquo;retreat from the undergraduate committees&rdquo;, in future the Undergraduate Studies Committee will be chaired by the Senior Lecturer.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">The Taskforce also endorsed the view of the mid-term review team that &ldquo;too much power is concentrated at the centre [in the] Executive Officers Group and Planning Group&rdquo;. It echoed the original report&rsquo;s recommendation for a &ldquo;two-way flow of ideas&rdquo; by saying that College should &ldquo;henceforth proceed on the basis of informed engagement&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">One method suggested to achieve this decentralisation was to reinstitute the &ldquo;Head of schools forum&rdquo; as the &ldquo;primary policy making forum&rdquo;. The Taskforce itself suggested a committee along these lines be established that would &ldquo;participate centrally in major decision-making&rdquo;. However, the e-mail distributed by the Provost on measures taken by the Board indicated that this body would only be a &ldquo;point of reference/sounding board&rdquo; for the Planning Group.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Further points of agreement were found on more minor issues such as the role of faculty deans and annual officers, with consensus on the need for clarification and debate on the role of the Provost likely to impact the upcoming Provostial elections. The Taskforce also fully &ldquo;endorsed the recommendations in respect of administration&rdquo;, which provided a five-point plan to achieve greater flexibility, efficiency, clearer reporting lines, reform of central administration, cross-school co-operation and identifiable role boundaries.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A promise was also given by the Board to take up the recommendation to institute a &ldquo;fit-for-purpose information system&rdquo; that spans students, staff, research and finance. No timeline was given, however, for when this is expected to be in place. The original report said this system is likely to take &ldquo;2-3 years at least&rdquo; and gave a &ldquo;word of caution&rdquo; about the possible &ldquo;derailment&rdquo; of this project through &ldquo;bad planning or over-ambition&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Given the rejection of the mid-term review team&rsquo;s central recommendations of renewed restructuring that should proceed &ldquo;urgently&rdquo;, the section on &ldquo;planning the re-launch of the reforms&rdquo; is absent from the Taskforce&rsquo;s document and the Provost&rsquo;s e-mail. No indication could be found in the Board meeting minutes of any intention to reject the most significant recommendations of the mid-term review team and their reaction remains to be seen.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">A review of effectiveness of any changes made will take place after one year &ldquo;in cases where there has been significant change to current operations&rdquo;.</span></p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Documents obtained by <em>The University Times</em> indicate that the recommendations made by the mid-term review team, Profs.
