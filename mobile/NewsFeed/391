{"Body": "<p>Trinity college is currently without a Chair of Theology and a Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English, an issue raised at the University Board meeting held on September 16th last. While efforts have been made to fill the positions none have been successful with the preferred candidates for both positions declining the respective Chairs. The Board of the University has now decided that there is no appointable candidate for the Chair of Theology and the Chair is to remain vacant for the present. The Board has now moved onto pursuing the second appointable candidate for the Chair of Medieval and Renaissance Literature.&nbsp; <br />A source connected to the Centre for Medieval and Renaissance English has told University Times that they understand from colleagues in the UK that the chair has been offered to a Milton specialist. This a controversial move when a Milton(1608- 1674) specialist would not be considered to have expertise in the Middle Ages or, arguably, the Renaissance.</p>\n<p>According to Dr Alyn Stacey, founder of the centre for Centre for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, said that it was vitally important that the Chair be filled swiftly but only by an exceptional specialist in both Medieval and Renaissance literature. Dr Alyn Stacey would like to see Dr Gerald Morgan (School of English, TCD) take the position, whom she called an obvious candidate for the post in light of his outstanding service to the subject and the College. However, Dr Morgan has not applied for the position.</p>\n<p>The College appointment system is in disarray. The new College appointment system allows for a maximum of 30 posts to be made available in the college as a whole each year. This system requires that college departments compete against one another to secure an appointment. This means that departments who had appointments ready to be filled this year lost out on the opportunity to appoint to the still vacant Chair of Theology and Chair of Medieval and Renaissance. Even after the 30 posts to be appointed have been decided, the appointment process remains vague with even senior academics uncertain about who is being invited to fill positions in their departments and are hearing about appointments on the academic grapevine.</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>Trinity college is currently without a Chair of Theology and a Chair of Medieval and Renaissance English, an issue raised at the University Board meeting held on September 16th last.
