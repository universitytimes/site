He highlighted the successful amendment made to the 1997 Universities Act by Senator Joe Lee and himself, which enshrined the responsibility of Universities to &ldquo;preserve and promote the traditional principles of academic freedom in the conduct of its internal and external affairs&rdquo;. This amendment formed the basis for Swedish legislation on the issue soon after.\n\nThe initial recommendation of the meeting was that academics should petition their respective governing bodies to call for a declaration on academic freedom, similar to the one passed by the Board of Trinity College Dublin earlier this year. If the passion evident at the meeting is replicated in opposition to the Croke Park reforms, University managers could find it increasingly challenging to keep finances in the black without looking at cutting pay again.", "Imageurl": "<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 9.0px 'Whitney HTF SemiBold'} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 10.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; font: 9.0px 'Whitney HTF'} p.p3 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 10.0px; font: 9.0px 'Utopia Std'} span.s1 {font: 9.0px 'Whitney HTF'; letter-spacing: -0.1px} span.s2 {letter-spacing: -0.2px} span.s3 {letter-spacing: -0.1px} -->By Barra Roantree -\u00a0College Affairs Correspondent\n\nAs the national press descended upon Merrion Street to hear Brian Cowen deliver his resignation last Saturday, a very different gathering was taking place in the Gresham Hotel.
