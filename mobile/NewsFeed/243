The Bill states the government&rsquo;s intention cut-back on tax relief for student charges. The Bill states, &ldquo;Tax relief for student charges and fees will be curtailed also - there will be no tax relief on the first &euro;2,000 of charges for full time students, the first 1,000 for part time students.&rdquo; In reality, this means that a full-time post-graduate student will lose 400 euro a year and part-time post-grads will lose 200 euro in relief.

The survey consisted of questions across a broad range of topics such as student health and welfare, individual student well-being and the perception of SU policy issues. In total 1711 students responded to the survey.\n\n82% of students who took part in the survey said they are generally happy with the job TCDSU is doing, with 6% disagreeing. 72% of respondents said they agreed with the statement, &ldquo;The Students&rsquo; Union accurately reflects the general opinion of the student population in its policies.&rdquo; The survey also revealed a very high level of student satisfaction in the newly introduced SU Deal of the Week, with 71% of respondents stating that they have availed of it as of week ten of last term. The results also showed that 78% of surveyed students had attended at least one Ents event last term with only 7% complaining of a lack of variety in the events. The TCDSU Communications Offcer, who tabled the motion at SU council said, &ldquo;This is a hugely important step for the Students&rsquo; Union to take, and I&rsquo;m glad it received such support from reps.&rdquo; He went on to say, &ldquo;The Union and its elected representatives will be forced to evaluate themselves in the eyes of the student population - if you were worried that the SU was operating in a bubble before, this new mandate has burst it.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "By Ian Curran - Deputy News Editor\n\n<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 22.0px 'Utopia Std'} --><strong>A fresh <em>Discovery </em>for Trinity Orchestra\n</strong>Continuing on their trend of adapting the music of contemporary artists, the Trinity Orchestra will perform Daft Punk&rsquo;s 2001 album, &ldquo;Discovery,&rdquo; live in the exam hall on Friday the 18th of February.
