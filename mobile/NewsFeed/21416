{"Body": "<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><strong>Aisling Curtis</strong> | Contributing Writer</span>\r\n\r\nAlmost two-thirds of this year's 60,000 third-level grants have been paid to students, according to\u00a0Ireland's student grant body, Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI). As of the 1st November, 43,000 grants have been awarded and 39,000 students paid.\r\n\r\n23,000 first-time applicants and 20,000 renewal students have been informed that they have been\u00a0awarded grants, compared to only 6,000 this time last year. Improvements to its system following an\u00a0independent review have allowed SUSI to process grants more efficiently. Students who met priority\u00a0processing deadlines and provided correct documentation have already received their grants.\r\n\r\nSUSI has implemented additional payment runs in order to award grants to the remaining 17,000\u00a0applicants as quickly as possible. These will run weekly throughout November until all grants have\u00a0been processed. Students who have yet to be awarded grants will receive any back money in their\u00a0first grant payment.\r\n\r\nSUSI stated that 4,000 students who have been awarded grants but are awaiting payment will\u00a0receive their grant as soon as their college confirms their registration and they provide the requisite\u00a0bank details.\r\n\r\nThis is a significant improvement from November 2012, when only 10% of grants had been\u00a0awarded. Some students experienced major delays last year, with 565 grant applicants for the 2012/2013\u00a0academic year still awaiting processing as of July 2013.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/susi11.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21416", "Heading": "SUSI Reports 43,000 Grants Have Been Paid"}
