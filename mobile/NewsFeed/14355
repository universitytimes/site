She feels that many students are not even aware that the hub of SU activity is in House 6, pointing out that students are not likely to go there unless they are involved in a society or the SU. This is a problem she will focus on; &ldquo;I want to make the SU into a relevant body which listens to the students about the small and large annoyances of daily college life and does something about it,&rdquo; she told The University Times.\n\nShe emphasizes the failings of the SUSI grant system and wants the SU to &ldquo;be on the backs of the awarding bodies from day one&rdquo; to ensure students receive their funding on time. In her role as President she would continue to focus on ensuring the government do not make any more cuts to the grants.\n\nShe believes the SU&rsquo;s current part time jobs listing is insufficient and if elected would transform it into a dedicated online section which could be accessed by students at any time. She wants to create an SU app for smartphones so that students can easily access information such as deal of the week, library information and timetables. &ldquo;If elected I&rsquo;d make this a reality and give students a say on what they want to see on their app,&rdquo; she said.\u00a0\u00a0<strong>UK.</strong>\n<h3>Tom Lenihan</h3>\n<strong>COURSE:\u00a0</strong>JS Law &amp; Business<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/01/21/su-election-candidates-profiled/tomlen-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14359\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14359\" title=\"TomLen\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/TomLen13-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n<strong>AGE:\u00a0</strong>21\n\n<strong>CAMPAIGN MANAGER:\u00a0</strong>Jack Danaher\n\n21 year old Tom Lenihan is running for the position of SU President. The Dublin student, who \u00a0plans on being a filmmaker when he leave college, has a wide variety of experience and positions within the student community. He is Secretary of the Law Society, Film Editor for Trinity News, Legal Counsel for Fishsoc, an active member of VDP and Class Rep for JS Law &amp; Business.\n\nWhen asked about his vision for the campaign, Lenihan declared that &ldquo;Student Union elections for many are an irrelevance and often are only notable for a funny campaign poster or a promise never to be fulfilled. For others it is an opportunity to make their voice heard and have a say in the way the university is run.&rdquo; \u00a0He feels that many students doubt the competence and validity of the union in identifying and acting upon the needs and wants of its members, &ldquo;Often people groan when they are asked to vote or support a union they see that does not represent their views. Such cynicism is warranted given the widespread cuts to services and the disconnect between college authorities and students.&rdquo;\n\nLenihan believes that to change the status quo what is needed is &ldquo;a person that understands the issues students face and will not only strive to retain existing services but improve on them in order to make college life easier.&rdquo;\n\nHis aim is to represent the ideas and views that every student can offer and communicate that in a clear, accessible and achievable manifesto. He stated that &ldquo;It takes someone to have the energy and enthusiasm to bridge the gap between college authorities and the SU and share their obligation to serve the students of Trinity. I can be that person&rdquo;.\u00a0<strong>COD.</strong>\n<h2>Lylas Aljohmani</h2>\n<strong>COURSE:</strong> 5th Medicine<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/01/21/su-election-candidates-profiled/lylal/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14361\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14361\" title=\"LylAl\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/LylAl3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n<strong>AGE:</strong> 22\n\n<strong>CAMPAIGN MANAGER:</strong> Dani Hersee\n\nThis final year student has taken on an impressive amount of SU and society responsibilities since her first days at college.

To this end, she proposes holding informal clinics in social areas such as the arts block couches. She believes one the key tasks of the president is to ensure the rights of students inside and outside Trinity walls are upheld, and the issue of grant cuts and late payments need to be at the centre of future lobbying. She will continue the tradition started by Rory Dunne of donating 10% of the president salary to the Student Hardship fund.\n\n&ldquo;Making the most of the services we have is vital in improving the Trinity student&rsquo;s experience,&rdquo; states Aljohmani. She wants to improve the accommodation advisory service by setting up links with private letting offices to provide Trinity students with priority in student accommodation hot spots. She would like to see the SU bookshop used more by setting up an online catalogue, and organising college book sales in each term, managed and staffed by students.\n\nShe believes the SU needs to support students as they make their future decisions, and proposes working with the alumni office and careers advisory service to create an internships base, as this will &ldquo;insure that the SU is taking care of it&rsquo;s students even after they leave Trinity&rsquo;s cobbled streets.&rdquo;\u00a0<strong>UK.</strong>\n<h1>Education Officer</h1>\n<h3>Jack Leahy<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/01/21/su-election-candidates-profiled/jackl/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14362\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14362\" title=\"JackL\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/JackL3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a></h3>\n<strong>COURSE:\u00a0</strong>JS History &amp; English Literature\n\n<strong>AGE:\u00a0</strong>21\n\n<strong>CAMPAIGN MANAGER:</strong>\u00a0Colm O'Donnell\n\nJack Leahy is a third-year TSM History and English Literature student who is running for the position of Education Officer.

Leahy has been involved in a large amount of societies including DU History and TrinityTV, in addition to two years of peer mentoring.\n\nLeahy became sports editor of <em>The University Times</em> in his first year. He now holds the position of news editor. In keeping with his media background, Leahy is a founding co-director of the National Media Conference, held in Trinity last November.\n\nHe also has notable SU responsibilities. Leahy has been a class rep, secretary to SU Council, and is currently the Finances and Services Officer on the SU Executive. He has represented students in USI special congress on fees and to College on matters of student finances.\n\nIf elected, Leahy wants to ensure that decisions of the college are made with the students in mind. He hopes to increase student input in module assessment and ensure that valuable education resources like library hours, study space and book access are not undermined in this economic climate. He wants to capitalise upon positive developments with regards the 24hr-library facilities and increase opening hours in the Hamilton and John Stearne libraries as well as book access and LEN availability in the BLU libraries.\n\nLeahy&rsquo;s campaign is based on interaction between the students and the SU and a holistic approach to student life and equipping students with the skills will make them attractive to employers. If elected, he plans to organise courses in anything from crisis management and project leadership to basic coding and design, free of charge, for students of the College to keep Trinity students competitive in a tough market for graduates.\n\nHe aims to make the SU &ldquo;reach out and give members a sense of ownership of their Union.&rdquo; In short he plans to &ldquo;increase dialogue&rdquo;, to further &ldquo;discussion of SU policies with students&rdquo;, and increase what the &ldquo;SU can offer students beyond the confines of lectures, labs and tutorials.&rdquo;\u00a0<strong>CB.</strong>\n<h3>Eric Tebay</h3>\n<strong>COURSE</strong>: SS Biochemistry<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/01/21/su-election-candidates-profiled/erict/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14363\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14363\" title=\"EricT\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/EricT3-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n<strong>AGE</strong>: 21\n\n<strong>CAMPAIGN MANAGER</strong>: Richard Diffley\n\nTebay has been involved in student politics since his first year, taking on more responsibilities each year.

He organised Science Ball 2013 and is an active member of Q Soc, with a particular interest in all LGBT social issues.\n\nHe wants to make the Union more transparent and accessible to students, and in this respect would create an online discussion forum on an Education Facebook page, and ensure that students&rsquo; concerns and suggestions are taken back to the appropriate college committees. If elected he would bring a better focus to study skills, as he believes students find it difficult to make the transition from Leaving Cert style rote learning to independent college studying. He proposes to introduce a new Exam Skills Week into the college calendar, featuring seminars and workshops on essay writing, time management and study techniques.\n\n&ldquo;College&rsquo;s current methods for assessing courses are not as effective as they could be,&rdquo; he told The University Times. He wants to centralise how students assess their modules, believing that a single survey per term would encourage more students to take the survey and so improve the quality of their education.\n\nHe sees opportunities to improve library services, stating that the introduction of automated borrowing and returning services means the Union can push for longer opening hours and the creation of more study space, ensuring students have access to resources when they need them. <strong>UK</strong>\n<h3>John Curtin</h3>\n<strong>Course:</strong> Law &amp; French\n\n<strong>Age: </strong>22\n\n<strong>Campaign Manager:</strong> Aoife Considine \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/01/21/su-election-candidates-profiled/curtin/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14392\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14392\" title=\"curtin\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/curtin3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n\nRunning for the position of Education Officer is 4th Year Law and French student John Curtin. Curtin made the decision to run having spent last year on Erasmus in Paris where he organised a delegation from his college to attend the Model United Nations World Championships in Vancouver. He has since set his sights on organising a potential Trinity delegation to participate at this year&rsquo;s event. He began examining the current educational set-up in Trinity and the possibility of more practical work in many courses while volunteering for a new free legal aid clinic for startups and small business along with other Trinity students.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Curtin, an &ldquo;experienced debater&rdquo;, has been involved in mentoring of Erasmus students in college and has worked with Amnesty International as part of their student speakers programme.

Stephen Garry already has experience in the field of taking care of students, having been Trinity Halls JCR Welfare Officer. Garry&rsquo;s resume is extensive. He is the incumbent President of Trinity&rsquo;s Student2Student program &ndash; and a current member of the See Change Youth panel (a group outside of college that works to lessen the stigma attached to mental health issues).\n\nThe policies Garry proposes to implement reflect the work he has done in the field of mental health. He hopes to better equip Trinity Students to deal with stresses of college life by making available both education and training programs. Garry describes this as &lsquo;the cornerstone&rsquo; of his prospective office.\n\nGarry believes the Welfare Officer must be well placed to hold dialogue between the various bodies in college, identifying the role of the Welfare office as &lsquo;a collaborative one&rsquo;. Garry cites his close work with Trinity&rsquo;s Health Promotion Officer, the Student Counselling Service and the Senior Tutor as necessary experience he will bring to the Welfare office as he seeks to &lsquo;improve collaboration on SU projects and obtain college backing, finacial and promotional, for these endeavours&rsquo;.\u00a0<strong>CK.</strong>\n<h1>Communications Officer</h1>\n<h3>Matthew Taylor</h3>\n<strong>COURSE:</strong> SS History<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/01/21/su-election-candidates-profiled/matt-1/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14366\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14366\" title=\"Matt (1)\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Matt-13-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a>\n<strong>AGE:</strong> 21\n\n<strong>CAMPAIGN MANAGER:</strong> Claire McCabe\n\nMatthew Taylor is running for the position of Communications Officer.

Education isn&rsquo;t meant to be an efficient service which sees you mindlessly piloted through college before being thrown out. To me, this seems to be too prevalent a view among both educators and students. It is a large source of the ills of education, because it leads to a situation where people don&rsquo;t care for one another and cease to act in a broader interest beyond themselves.

He cites the University Times as being &ldquo;one of the reasons he came to Trinity&rdquo; and has been involved with the UT since arriving at the college.\n\nHaving been involved with college media since his first year, as deputy editor in the second volume, Gavin has held the position of magazine editor since 2011.

Having worked with The Irish Times and Orla O&rsquo;Donnell of RT\u00c9, Byrne is no stranger to the newsroom. Most recently, she was an intern in local LA newspaper, The Brentwood News.\n\nShe has been involved with the University Times since coming to Trinity and in her three-and-a-half years has held a number of positions, including news editor in the last volume, and is the incumbent deputy editor.

He wants to use the role of Communications officer to bring students back in touch with their union, to be aware of what their union is doing for them, and what it has the potential to do.\n\nIn relation to college he feels there is a lack of interaction between the student body and the college administration. &ldquo;As cutbacks increase student services continue to shrink and without direct interaction between the student body and administration we cannot hope to preserve and prioritise necessary services.

This is a small chunk of his experience, having also run events in Dandelion, Whelan's, Howl at The Moon and several other Dublin nightclubs. He tells us that in this time he has made countless connections in the Dublin nightlife industry which, added to his experience will allow him to secure the best deals for the students of Trinity.\n\nHe pledges to &ldquo;reintroduce a weekly Ents night, so that Trinity students are not left at the mercy of club promoters who often charge upwards of &euro;10 entry. A Trinity Ents club night is essential both for organising class parties and for providing a venue to book major bands &amp; DJs.&rdquo;\n\nOther ideas of his include see cheap weekend trips to some of the major European cities such as Amsterdam, Prague and Berlin. Talking to The University Times he told us that he &ldquo;would love to organise a trip to something like the Amsterdam Dance Event in October!&rdquo;\n\nThe Trinity Ball is arguably the Ents Officer's biggest responsibility, and this is an area Mulville feels the students have been let down in recent years. He says that he &ldquo;would never challenge the sanctity of the Ball; the atmosphere is unbeatable and it is always one of the best nights of the year. But last year we were essentially given the leftovers of the UCD Ball, with artists travelling straight from UCD to Trinity in order to lower MCD's costs.

One of the few things The University Times can verify is that Macauley is a student of Trinity College, Dublin &ndash; though whether he is a student of Business &amp; Arabic, as he claims, is less certain.\n\nMacauley was inspired while inter-railing in either 2009 or 2002 to &lsquo;pursue a career in quality drinks promos&rsquo;, and having already conquered UCD Ents (he claims to have been UCD Ents offer in both 2006 and 2007, a claim disputed by the UCD Ents Bebo page), he has decided to bring his love of &lsquo;getting his mates concession into clubs&rsquo; to Trinity. The core tenet of his campaign is one of transparency is Trinity&rsquo;s Student Union. Macauley promises students that he will keep abreast of the actions of his fellow officers, primarily by having them &lsquo;email, text and Facebook me what they&rsquo;re up to&rsquo;.\n\nWhat qualifies Macaulay for such heavy-duty work? As &lsquo;UCD Ents officer&rsquo; he &lsquo;brought&rsquo; such acts as &lsquo;Delorentos&rsquo; to the &lsquo;UCD Ball&rsquo; and successfully implementing a staff wristband system for the UCD Ents Exec. Perhaps more impressive than these achievements, Macaulay was voted &lsquo;Most likely to Party with Shaggy&rsquo; in his high-school year book, an accolade with which few are honoured.\n\nMacaulay hopes to use the Ents office to recapture his former glories of organizer of &lsquo;Sorority&rsquo; at Bondi Beach Club, a night which regularly boasted attendance equalling 48% of capacity - an impressive considering the girls-only policy of the night. Macauley&rsquo;s fundamental aim is to promote\u00a0 Trinity&rsquo;s entertainment side over it&rsquo;s academic side, asserting that &lsquo;people like to drink cans, not books&rsquo;. to all areas of college in a way best suited to them&rdquo;. CK\n<h3>Conor 'Shmeesh' Gleeson</h3>\n<strong>COURSE: </strong>SS BESS\n\n<strong>AGE: </strong>21\n\n<strong>CAMPAIGN MANAGER: </strong>David Egan\n\n<span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Born and raised in the harsh streets of Sligo, Conor Gleeson (more affectionately known as Shmeesh) is a Senior Sophister Business and Economics Student. He has studied both marketing and accounting, what he believes are the two fundamental attributes required to be a successful<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/01/21/su-election-candidates-profiled/smeesh/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14404\"><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-14404\" title=\"smeesh\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/smeesh3-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></a> Entertainments officer.\u00a0</span></span><span style=\"font-size: small; color: #222222; line-height: 19px;\">Shmeesh has a\u00a05 point plan he believes can revolutionise Ents.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: small; line-height: 19px;\">To further improve on the stellar work of previous Ents officers, Shmeesh has promised to introduce small screens at the Pav, as well as revolutionary new ideas such as BYOBav and BYONaggins. Shmeesh promises to introduce heaters outside as well as awnings, so students can damage their lungs in a warm and dry environment.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">When residing in Trinity Hall in first year, Shmeesh discovered it is an &ldquo;absolute trek&rdquo; from Rathmines to college, a reality he believes doesn&rsquo;t bode well for either college or nightclub attendance. The vast expanses of the rugby and cricket pitches are locations which Shmeesh sees as having huge potential for a brick-by-brick relocation of Trinity Halls. In the likely event that such plans fail to make it past the college buildings office, Shmeesh will look into providing free buses from halls to those that hold tickets for every Trinity Ents night.</span></span>\n<span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: small; line-height: 19px;\">Shmeesh acknowledges that it is important to represent students in matters other than the area of entertainment. With this in mind, and with the recent announcement that the Berkeley Library opening hours are increasing to 24 hours during exam time, Shmeesh asks the question, &ldquo;Why not have a 36 hour study space?&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: small; line-height: 19px;\">'Shmoke of the Week', Shmeesh acknowledges that not all trinity students want events involving alcohol, so he has contacted 'Maguires'\u00a0regarding\u00a0discounts on\u00a0his favourite tobaccos. This he has branded 'Shmoke of the Week'.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: small; line-height: 19px;\">Shmeesh&rsquo;s CV is very impressive, currently being the poster boy of the student union (he actually puts up the posters for the SU), having run a moderate number of relatively successful underage discos in his hometown of Sligo as well as a heavy involvement in the previous two Ents crews. Shmees believes his postering experiences gives him an edge over his rivals as &ldquo;Postering is a very risky business,\u00a0pricked\u00a0fingers and impaled toes caused by spilled thumb tacs&rdquo;. If elected as Ents officer, Shmeesh promises to nurture the talents of prospective poster boys, enlightening them in the arts of safety procedure and teaching them his 'innovative' techniques of eye-catching poster arrangement.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Shmeesh also had the 'general soundness' to have a &ldquo;Black Winter&rdquo; in his junior Freshman year. In doing so that he was able to sample all that the Dublin nightlife has to offer, while also researching various popular television series from the comfort of his bed.</span></span>\n<span style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">Shmeesh is an animal lover and promotes the protection of all animals, in particular fish, and has never been involved in a society that has been founded solely on the murder of one of god&rsquo;s creatures.</span></span>\n<span style=\"color: #222222; font-size: small; line-height: 19px;\">Speaking to UT, Shmeesh was quick to stress that more of his 'revolutionary' plans can be read in the manifesto and encouraged students to approach\u00a0his campaign team and find out more.</span>", "Imageurl": "14374", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14355", "Heading": "SU Election Candidates Profiled"}
