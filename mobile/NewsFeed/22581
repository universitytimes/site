The proposed motion comes on the back of reports of ongoing attacks on LGBTQ citizens across Russia, as well as the startling revelation that any journalist who attempts to use anything that isn't official recording equipment, such as iPads or mobile phones, or tries to to record anything that isn't Olympic footage may have their press pass revoked, and be asked to leave the country.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"It's an outward demonstration of support for the LGBTQ community in Russia by the college.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As well as this, the motion will officially condemn the discriminatory and oppressive anti-gay laws that Russia has implemented in its recent history, and will applaud the LGBTQ community and its allies at large in their continued boycott of, and actions against, the holding of the Winter Olympics in Russia.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Coca-Cola Company, one of the official sponsors of the Winter Olympics, were asked to make a comment on the issue, but declined. Similarly, the Olympic Council have refused to take a stand on whether or not they support the Russian government's condemnation of LGBTQ people.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The motion will be proposed by Students&rsquo; Union (SU) President Tom Lenihan, and is heavily supported by both QSoc and Amnesty. Katie Biggs, QSoc Auditor, said of the motion: \"It's an outward demonstration of support for the LGBTQ community in Russia by the college. We are a socially aware college, and we like to be involved and raise awareness; this is one way of achieving that.\"</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some \"may not understand the direct impact of having the Winter Olympics somewhere that supporters, athletes and the people of the country are not allowed to express their sexuality in any way.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Russian government have assured the international community that no harm will come to athletes, their teams or their supporters. However, it has been pointed out by many that it is not the government carrying out the violence, it is vigilantes in the streets of the cities. \"The problem isn't the government, it's the radical people who launch attacks on LGBTQ people in Russia,&rdquo; said Biggs. &ldquo;Most people are aware of what's going on, but they may not understand the direct impact of having the Winter Olympics somewhere that supporters, athletes and the people of the country are not allowed to express their sexuality in any way.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If the motion passes, all products produced by The Coca-Cola Company will be removed from outlets such as the SU Shop and SU Caf\u00e9 for the duration of the Winter Olympics, from February 7th to February 23rd, 2014; these include all forms of Coca-Cola, but also Sprite, Fanta and Evian.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tcdstall.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22581", "Heading": "SU Council to Hear Motion for the Ban of Coca-Cola Products During Winter Olympics"}
