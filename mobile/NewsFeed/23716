{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Leanna Byrne</strong> | Editor</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trinity College Students&rsquo; Union (TCDSU), Students&rsquo; Unions and student LGBTQ societies braved the cold and rain to demonstrate outside the Russian Embassy in Dublin at 11am today.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The demonstration takes place in concurrence with the college-wide ban of Coca-Cola and Procter &amp; Gamble products and two days before the Winter Olympic Games commence in Sochi.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Today's demonstration aimed to show solidarity with the Russian LGBTQ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer) community.The decision to protest against the Winter Olympics was made by Students&rsquo; Union Council in response to Russia&rsquo;s ongoing violations of Human Rights Law and persecution of LGBTQ people. The failing international efforts to protest for repeal of the 'Anti-Gay Propaganda Laws' in Russia owes to the inaction of the powerful and the lack of orchestration of common efforts in different countries throughout the world.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking at the protest Vice President Equality and Citizenship, Laura Harmon, called for President Putin to pledge not to arrest anyone who is shown to be supporting LGBTQ rights during the Winter Olympics, for the International Olympics Committee to honour Principle of the Code of Human Rights, for the Irish Government to condemn the treatment of LGBTQ people in Sochi and across Russia, and for Putin to lift the 100 ban on Moscow Pride.</p>\r\nTCDSU LGBT Rights Officer, Stephen Hatton, also spoke outside the embassy about the shame that is brought to members of the LGBTQ community in Russia by their own government.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We are here to show our support and stand by the queer community in Russia,&rdquo; said Hatton. &ldquo;We want to make a fuss, we want to make a ruckus. We want people to take notice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TCDSU President, Tom Lenihan commented saying: &ldquo;We want to send a message to Russia that continuing with this violence and intimidation is not acceptable and make our voices heard in whatever way possible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speakers included Vladimir Dotsenko, a Russian national working as a lecturer in Dublin; Max Kyrzanowski, Organiser with LGBT Noise; Amy Dudley, Auditor of DIT LGBT Society; and Patrick Dempsey, Co-Chair of IGLYO (International LGBTQ Youth and Student Organisation).</p>\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0222.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23716", "Heading": "TCD Students Continue Winter Olympics Protest"}
