The evening, a 'long awaited' one according to Prendergast, comprised of a host of speeches, music provided by the Traditional Irish Music Society and a wine reception.\n\nThe room, which has been open since Freshers&rsquo; Week, functions as a space for Gaeilgeoir\u00ed and Irish language enthusiasts who wish to experience Trinity life through the medium of Irish.\n\nThe room was granted by the Space Allocation Committee at the end of the last academic year following a campaign led by An Cumann Gaelach. Trinity College is now in the majority of Irish universities to provide such a space designated to Irish speakers.\n\nBreathnach spoke of his pride on hearing Irish in conversation as he passed under Front Arch earlier in the day and praised Trinity students for their fighting spirit in promoting the Irish language on campus.\n\nSeomra na Gaeilge, which can be accessed at the rear of the Buttery in Botany Bay, is open weekdays between 9:00 and 16:30. Tea and coffee-making facilities are available and the latest Irish language newspapers, magazines and books are provided.\n\nThe room will also host the weekly Ciorcal Comhr\u00e1 (Conversation Cirlce) organised by An Cumann Gaelach on Tuesdays at 7.30, as well as other events throughout the year. Trinity students are invited and encouraged to organise Irish language events in Seomra na Gaeilge.\n\nAmong those in attendance at last night&rsquo;s opening were former auditors of An Cumann Gaelach, Jen N\u00ed Mhath\u00fana and S\u00e9amus Conboy, and former TCD Students&rsquo; Union president C\u00f3n\u00e1n \u00d3 Broin.\n\nSeomra na Gaeilge has seen throngs of visitors since it first became available for use two weeks ago and it appears that the room&rsquo;s popularity looks set to flourish.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Directions to Seomra na Gaeilge can be found <a href=\" http://www.tcd.ie/gaeloifig/en/seomra-gaeilge/\">here</a></em>", "Imageurl": "12617", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12616", "Heading": "Seomra na Gaeilge Officialy Opened"}
