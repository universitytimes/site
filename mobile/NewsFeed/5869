In the 2012-2013 academic year, that figure will be reduced to\u00a050%, and that level will remain until the Department next choose to review the pay scale. The Fianna F\u00e1il/Greens government had previously decided to reduce the rate to 45% from 2013 before gradually phasing out payment entirely.\n\nHaving planned to march to the Department of Health on Wednesday November 9th, INMO members and class reps \u00a0will now convene in Dublin on the same day to consider the organisation's\u00a0response to the government's decision after the INMO executive committee meet on the preceding days. Information meetings will take place on a local basis in the following week, at which members will be\u00a0balloted on the proposals.\n\nIn his email to nursing and\u00a0midwifery\u00a0students up and down the country, Mr. Doran informed members that the proposals were subject to a previously proposed review of the undergraduate nursing degree in Ireland. He also said that the Labour Court would be considering his organisation's claim that the Department of Health and the HSE '\u00a0breached their obligations under the Information and Consultation Directive in the manner in which they introduced [the] pay reduction' at a formal hearing on Tuesday, November 1st.\n\nHe also attached an email\u00a0sent to him by Michael Scanlan, Secretary General of the Department of Health, outlining the changes made to the pay structure, all of which come into effect at the expiration of the arrangements made for 2011. Therein, Mr. Scanlan\u00a0espoused\u00a0the Department's belief that the changes were 'very favourable to the nursing profession' given the 'considerable difficulty' posed by the current economic climate.\n\nSpeaking to <em>The University Times</em>, a high-ranking representative of INMO said that the proposal still 'undervalues nursing as a profession' but that the progress made on the matter was encouraging.\n\n'I love the work and thats why I chose nursing but a move like this\u00a0devalues nursing as a profession' said the second year, 'we get paid next to nothing for work that is\u00a0very demanding, both physically and emotionally'.\n\n'At least we have some improvements and movements on the pay cuts. \u00a0All\u00a0INMO members will have a national meeting in Dublin on the 8th of\u00a0November to discuss the proposal and it will be voted on whether we\u00a0should accept this proposal or continue with the campaign.'\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "5870", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5869", "Heading": "Nurses' protest cancelled as government reconsiders pay cuts"}
