They also added that they had sent each voter registration form in individual envelopes, and had hand-delivered the forms for the local Dublin City Council area from collected on deadline day before closing time. Other forms from both drives had been posted &ldquo;in time&rdquo;, Mr. Trigoub-Rotnem said, noting that they were sent at regular intervals during voter registration periods and only those that were collected on the last day were sent close to deadline.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Speaking to <em>The University Times</em> earlier today Mr. Trigoub-Rotnem said that over two-and-a-half thousand students had registered to vote in two separate drives in November of 2010 and February of 2011. In November&rsquo;s drive for the draft register 1,932 students had been registered over three weeks. February&rsquo;s drive had taken in &ldquo;around 700&rdquo; students, he said, although the exact figures were not available at the time of asking. These figures were supplemented by approximately 150 applications for postal votes.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Mr. Trigoub-Rotnem said that there had been &ldquo;a lot of confusion&rdquo; in organising these drives. &ldquo;Different councils were telling us different things about requirements. In November, for instance, Fingal County Council insisted that we need to have a member of the Garda\u00ed present for a voter registration. We took their advice and got a Garda for the registration but later found out, upon seeking legal advice, that this was not necessary at all. From day one dealing with the councils has been a mess&rdquo;.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Students groups and councils have previously come into conflict over voter registration and the 2011 General Election. In 2010, the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) successfully sued Dublin City Council after they had refused to accept registration forms from Dublin City University (DCU). The council had objected to multiple forms being sent in individual envelopes, but agreed to settle the case and accept the forms after taking legal advice.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">In the case of one student, Lara Hand of SF Law and French in Trinity College, Dublin, she failed to appear on the register despite registering at the same time as her room-mate. &ldquo;We both registered on the same day, at the same time, for Dublin City Council. She appeared on the register and I did not. I didn&rsquo;t receive a letter telling me why.&rdquo; Ms. Hand had initially tried to register in November and did manage to get on the register at the second time of asking on the last day of eligibility on February after finding out that she had been unsuccessful the first time around. Another student, SS Law student Elaine McDaid, also found herself off the register on election day. She forwarded this paper the e-mail she sent to Dublin City Council telling them how &ldquo;furious&rdquo; she was. Two other students were turned away from a polling place in Dublin South today after being registered in the voter registration campaign, one told this paper that a worker in the polling place had remarked &ldquo;not again&rdquo; when the issue arose.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Of those who have not appeared on their local electoral register TCDSU says that only one of those students have received a letter informing them that their registration form had been unsuccessful. The student in that case was from Donegal South-West and had been applying for a postal vote. Anyone who sends in an unsuccessful application is supposed to receive a letter telling them that they are not eligible to vote. TCDSU said that they consider it particularly remarkable that this did not happen in Dublin City Council where forms were handed in personally by SU Officers.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">TCDSU also said that there were problems with the mechanism for checking the register. &ldquo;We were told by the councils to go to <a href=\"http://checktheregister.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">checktheregister.ie</a> when we asked questions about who was and wasn&rsquo;t registered,&rdquo; Mr. Trigoub-Rotnem said, &ldquo;but we found that the website was not being updated .&rdquo; He also pointed to a number of occasions where students rang up their local councils to find that they were on the register after <a href=\"http://checktheregister.ie/\" target=\"_blank\">checktheregister.ie</a> had suggested that they were not. Mr. Trigoub-Rotnem says that the SU also called Pearse Street Garda station to find a copy of the roll of electors for the locality but that the station had not received one.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Mr. Trigoub-Rotnem said that he himself had been left off the register after taking part in November&rsquo;s registration drive. He also mentioned that President-elect of next year&rsquo;s Student Union, Ryan Bartlett, was in the same position. Welfare Officer Steph Fleming had found herself registered incorrectly in Halls rather than on campus, a problem that also appears to have affected a number of students. Mr Trigoub-Rotnem said </span>\"It's disheartening to find that when you register 2,700 student voters in Ireland today, you can't guarantee that they will be able to have a say in how our country is run. The administration of the electoral register seriously needs reforming and we have taken legal advice on this matter with a view to following it up after the election. For the first time, we are seeing students realise the importance of their vote, and administrative incompetence has helped push us back towards apathy. Why would students bother registering to vote if it's going to be such a hassle?\"\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">TCDSU say that they have been told in recent days by Dublin City Council that they were &ldquo;overwhelmed&rdquo;. Mr. Trigoub-Rotnem said that this council had &ldquo;undoubtedly been the most trouble&rdquo; and also that large numbers of those registered by the SU would have gone through the franchise section of that council due to the number of students living in its boundaries. He pointed to numbers the council had given him on voter registration as suspect. &ldquo;Apparently there were only around 80 new students registered for Halls (TCD off-campus accommodation) and 30 for the campus itself.&rdquo; He also queried national numbers in this regard. &ldquo;It has been said that 50,000 new voters were registered for this general election. But we alone would have provided almost 3,000 and the other colleges also registered thousands.&rdquo; </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">A total of six students had made calls directly to this paper today at the time of writing. Two had been knocked off the register after voting in 2009&rsquo;s local elections. One had her polling card sent to the wrong location. The other three were participants in the SU&rsquo;s voter registration scheme in Trinity. One woman, Aoise O&rsquo;Dwyer, reported having had two polling cards sent to her in 2009, one to her Dublin address and another to her home in Tullamore.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Pat de Br\u00fan, Campaigns and Communications Officer for the UCDSU, said earlier today that the students there had not experienced similar problems. Their first voter registration drive happened in September and the second mirrored that of TCD in February. They too had had &ldquo;thousands&rdquo; registered but they had dealt with the forms differently. The forms from their voter registration campaign had been sent out in September, while their February campaign had asked students to post the forms themselves. </span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Campaigns in the local Dublin South-East have begun recording complaints about the voting register, with both Labour and the campaign team of Trinity student Dylan Haskins having fielded e-mails from students who had been disenfranchised.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">Dublin City Council was not available for comment at the time of writing. The number listed for queries relating to the register of electors, 01-2225010, rang out repeatedly over a two-hour period. The USI were also unable to be contacted. A glance at their recent Facebook posting relating to their 2010 and 2011 student registration drives shows comment complaints from students saying that forms were sent in late and calling for apologies to be made.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\">In response to the problems with student voter registration TCDSU have sent out updates through social media sites asking for e-mails to </span><a href=\"mailto:elections@tcdsu.org\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial; color: #0000ff; font-size: small;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">election@tcdsu.org</span></span></a><span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: small;\"> and urging students to head to the polls. At the time of writing the hashtag #notregisteredge11 was trending on Twitter and RTE Elections had reported on the story.</span>", "Imageurl": "1923", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/76168_10150294529370573_718295572_15562774_5896063_n3", "ID": "1922", "Heading": "Anger as Trinity students left off register"}
