{"Body": "The latest University Times poll of 781 students has shown Aaron Heffernan to be at the height of his popularity just as he made the decision to quit the race.\nThe presidential joke candidate, facing off against long-time SU insider Ryan Bartlett, managed to pick up 55% of first preferences in the poll.\nAs voting opened in St James&rsquo; Hospital, voters noted that Heffernan&rsquo;s name had been scratched off the ballot. Heffernan campaign sources confirmed that he would not be contesting the election and that the decision would be announced at the SU-Provostial hustings on Monday night.\nElsewhere, the hotly-contested Ents race looked to be tightening again, as Ents Secretary Elaine McDaid&rsquo;s lead shrunk to ten points over the pretender, Chris O&rsquo;Connor.\nThe ill-tempered Education battle, meanwhile, shows no signs of moving, with Rachel Barry maintaining a respectable lead over SS Engineer John Cooney, even as he publicly called her the product of nepotism in front of an audience at St James&rsquo; hospital. Barry&rsquo;s father is a lecturer in the college.\nLouisa Miller, running for Welfare Officer, made up lost ground in the poll,  getting back to the heights she had lost in the last count of voting intentions, opening an 18-point lead against the next-closest candidate, LGBT Auditor Darren O&rsquo;Gorman.\nMeanwhile in the Communications race, which also determines the editor of this paper, News Editor Ronan Costello was soundly beating Trinity News Sports Editor Eleni Megoran, with a margin of 35 percentage points.\nThe departure of Heffernan will have an interesting effect on the other races, particularly Ents. Analysis of the most recent University Times poll shows that Heffernan voters tend to vote 5:4 in favour of Chris O&rsquo;Connor - Aaron&rsquo;s quitting the race will undoubtedly lead to fewer of these voters heading to the polls.\nIf half of Heffernan&rsquo;s supporters fail to show up at the ballot box, not an unrealistic scenario, O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s share of the vote would decrease to 37%, while McDaid&rsquo;s would rise to 54%.\nThis is good news for McDaid, whose lead is certainly not unassailable. Both candidates will need to give their all in the last few days of campaigning.\nBartlett should by no means consider his race run at this point either, despite the fact that he is unopposed following the departure of both of his opponents. Voters can tick &ldquo;Re-Open Nominations&rdquo; at the ballot box. If the Presidential RON vote exceeds that of Bartlett, the SU must start the nomination process again and re-run the election. Voters have never chosen this process before in Trinity Students&rsquo; Union elections, but Heffernan has had a huge and unprecedented effect on the race, and it&rsquo;s possible that the large number of Heffernan voters will choose RON in protest at their lack of choice.\nAll told, it looks like four of our five races have a clear front-runner now, but it&rsquo;s still all to play for in the Ents race.\nThe race had been  particularly testy, not just between the candidates but also their supporters, with everything coming to a head on Wednesday night as Elaine McDaid was assaulted on the bus back from Trinity Hall by students screaming &ldquo;COC for Ents&rdquo;. O&rsquo;Connor denounced the incident, and the candidates met on Friday to make peace and call on their supporters to be civil.\n<blockquote><strong> </strong>\n<strong>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Statement from the Heffernan campaign team</p>\n</blockquote>\n</strong>\nAaron has pulled out of the race today to focus on running for Provost of Trinity College. They say you can&rsquo;t get a good man elected President, but they never said anything about electing a good man to be Provost.\nThe campaign week was very exciting, and we had a lot of fun. While this campaign started as a joke, we&rsquo;ve met so many people over the week who really care about the college and their enthusiasm has rubbed off on us. Hopefully we&rsquo;ve raised awareness about issues surrounding SU politics, and hopefully in future we will have ten to twenty Ryan Bartletts running instead of just one.\nI hope everyone has had as much fun following us on the campaign trail as we have, and that we have highlighted the important issues raised by other candidates as well as Aaron.\nWe would like to thank both Seb and Ryan who not only saw the humourous and good-natured side of the campaign, but also ran fantastic campaigns in their own right. We wish Ryan the best of luck at the polls and we will certainly be voting for him.\nWe hope that this campaign has encouraged more people than usual to pick up manifestos and read them, to watch the online debates and keep track of this very important election that really does affect them, whether they know it or not. We have certainly learned a lot this week, and we hope that other people have as well.\nDespite the fun we&rsquo;ve had on the campaign trail, there have been casualties. Dear Prudence, lifelong bodyguard and trusted adviser to Mr Heffernan, passed away as so many bodyguards have, at the hands of a roaring grizzly bear outside the Arts Block. Shadows and dust, Maximus, shadows and dust.\nWe&rsquo;d like to end this rollercoaster by saying thank you for guessing that we could.</blockquote>\nTom Lowe, Editor", "Imageurl": "1118", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1445", "Heading": "Heffernan pulls out"}
