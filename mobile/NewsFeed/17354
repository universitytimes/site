Many will be looking to Heffernan to fill the &ldquo;eye-candy&rdquo; void left after primary heart-throb Robert Sheehan was dramatically cut from the programme at the end of series three.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking to Irish Independent journalists at Dublin's Fringe Festival, Heffernan said it was both a \"scary and exciting\" experience joining the cast of the show.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When contacted by The University Times he was quick to recognise the creative atmosphere and excellent work carried out in Trinity, stating, \"The Samuel Beckett Centre and DU Players are serious spots and potent breeding grounds for very strong work. It was between there and DUBC that my collegial loyalties lay and adventures took place for me in Uni.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Series four of Love/Hate airs\u00a0later this year.</em></p>\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/NWS_20130814_ANA_003_28583280_I2.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "17354", "Heading": "Former Trinity Student Takes Up Coveted Role in RT\u00c9&rsquo;s Love/Hate"}
