The union has successfully fought on a wide range of issues, such as increases in the availability of grant aid, the abolition of tuition fees and many other social concerns affecting students.</p>\n<p>Peter Mannion, President of the USI, said: &ldquo;For fifty years USI has been demanding a better future for our students and the country.The organisation has a truly colourful past and given that the USI is fifty years old this year, it is important to mark the occasion. USI has secured real change in this country with campaigns as diverse as contraception availability, free and accessible education, and protecting the rights of students. The organisation will continue to look forward while paying tribute to those who have made USI the vibrant tool of change in Irish society.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>SDLP&rsquo;s Mark Durkan, Labour&rsquo;s Eamonn Gilmore, Pat Rabbitte, Joe Duffy and Chief Justice John Murray are all former officers of USI and played considerably significant roles in the union during their years there.</p>\n<p>However, perhaps the most famous USI incident involved RT&Eacute; broadcaster Joe Duffy who, as president in 1983, had been leading a national protest over the withdrawal of the medical card for students. &ldquo;My argument at the time was that, if they take it away and we give it up without a fight, who are they going to target next?&rdquo; says Duffy. &ldquo;Students are generally healthy &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think I ever used my medical card &ndash; but letting them take it away would have opened the sluice gates.&rdquo; Duffy and four others ended up occupying the offices of the Eastern Health Board. The students were arrested and jailed for contempt of court when they ignored a High Court injunction against them. &ldquo;In order to withdraw the medical card, they had to write to students to inform them,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;The letters were being written and sent from those offices. If they couldn&rsquo;t send the letters, they couldn&rsquo;t take the cards. We took a principled stance and we knew the consequences.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The union has always had its critics. While USI is the only national student representative body with a seat on the Higher Education Authority and other national bodies, it does not represent all students. DCU and UL students&rsquo; unions, for example, are not members and other unions reaffiliate and disaffiliate all the time. Some argue that membership of USI should be compulsory for all unions so that all students will have a national voice, but that inevitably leads on to another perennial problem &ndash; money. Most of USI&rsquo;s funding comes from the &euro;5 subscription that each full-time student pays.</p>\n<p>The organisation looks forward to many more years of campaigning for a better education system, fairer student support, diversity in access to education, and adequate funding for all students.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Union of Students in Ireland celebrated its 50th anniversary last Friday the 20th.
