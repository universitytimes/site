The best way to make sure our stance is representative is for people to tell us, and the only way people will tell us is if we ask them.\n\n'Pretty much everyone we're spoken to this year, regardless of their position, has been quite concerned about access and that's been our priority this year. I expect that that will come up again next week but we'll have to see,' he added.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "6569", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6568", "Heading": "SU to hold Town Hall meeting on fees position"}
