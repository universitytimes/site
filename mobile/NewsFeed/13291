These include issues with the SUSI helpline, a lack of communication with students' unions and the Union of Students in Ireland and, most importantly, the delays in processing student's applications.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Latest figures show that, out of nearly 46,000 student applicants, just under 16,000 have been processed. In Trinity, under 100 students have had their application successfully processed out of some 2,000 who registered with the organisation.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">USI President John Logue relayed the problems that were being experienced with the new system at a meeting with authorities last week and encouraged the eventual decision to take on the new personnel to deal with the backlog.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Mr. Logue told The University Times that SUSI will also appoint a constant point of contact to ensure that Students' Unions have a definitive contact for getting information and updates from SUSI alongside the SUSI Forum. In addition, there was an agreement that Minister for Education and Skills Ruair\u00ed Quinn should release a statement calling on institutions to accommodate students who are unable to fully register on account of delayed grant payments.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While pleased with the announcement, Mr. Logue stated that if he feels &ldquo;that significant improvements are not made in relation to the processing of applications&rdquo; then &ldquo;an escalation of action may be necessary&rdquo;. Meanwhile, Students Union President, Rory Dunne, welcomed the introduction of new staff stating the he feels &ldquo;that SUSI are making positive steps towards ensuring that the issues in grant delays are resolved&rdquo; but also remained wary. Mr. Dunne said that it must be remembered that, while SUSI only applies to Junior Freshman applicants this year, next year &ldquo;SUSI will be responsible for an additional cohort of Junior Freshmen as well&rdquo; and that these setbacks cannot persist for fear of larger numbers of incomplete applicants come the 2013/2014 academic year.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The scheme was set up in an effort to streamline the grant system upon which many students rely to pay for their living costs while attending college across the country. Its main aim was to enable the grant payouts to be centralised through the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee (VEC) as opposed to the former method of processing grant applicants through the 66 local authorities and VECs nationwide. Furthermore, the new scheme utilises an online application process in order to make it easier to claim grants. However, in the face of the recent difficulties many have come to question the efficiency of this facility and SUSI hope that the addition of new staff will re-instate applicants' confidence in the programme.</p>", "Imageurl": "13293", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13291", "Heading": "Grants authority to hire new staff to meet backlog"}
