The phenomenon of members of GMB debating societies running for positions as part of voting blocks on different committees around college, especially those of smaller journals and magazines, is starting to gain considerable notice. While this can legitimately be put down to students with a natural propensity to becoming involved in extra-curricular activities pursuing multiple interests, the fear of &ldquo;takeover&rdquo; from members of a larger society is a real one, evidenced by most societies having protection of some sort written into their constitutions.
