The headline events (including the RAG Week ball, Trinity Come Dancing and the RAG Week Closing Party) also heavily contributed to the success.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite this positivity, Reynolds was critical of the JCR in Trinity Halls claiming that &ldquo;there was little support of RAG Week from the JCR&rdquo; and that this was &ldquo;disappointing considering the relatively vast financial resources they have at their disposal.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nAccording to Reynolds, who chaired the RAG Week Committee, another improvement which could be made would be the creation of a &ldquo;standalone RAG Week website&rdquo;. He explained that the committee had hoped to introduce a website this year but that &ldquo;unfortunately due to unforeseen problems it couldn&rsquo;t be achieved in time.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nDespite the financial difficulties faced by many students, RAG Week has been growing year-on-year. In 2011 it raised &euro;12,000, which was a 300% increase from the previous year. The dramatic increase was seen as a result of students being encouraged to engage in individual projects such as Gumball challenges and sponsored fasts and silences.\r\n\r\nSarah McAvinchey, President of Cancer Soc, who completed a 24-hour silence to raise funds for RAG week, praised the support from both Ents and Trinity volunteering and commented that it was &ldquo;great to see so many individual fundraisers get involved.&rdquo; She stated that as a society the support was above that of any other year, concluding &ldquo;it was the best RAG Week we've had since I&rsquo;ve been in college.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1526914_650084798383372_801309653_n.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23548", "Heading": "RAG Week Fundraising Target Exceeded"}
