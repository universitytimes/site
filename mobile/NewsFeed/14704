The ban occurred due to the actions of a member of &lsquo;Team Tom&rsquo; who plugged the candidate on facebook before the official start of campaigning, unbeknownst to Lenihan.\n\nThe planned focus of day one of the campaign was to be students&rsquo; mental health, though with a hindered online presence, this was not possible. Lenihan instead spent the day meeting with students &ldquo;telling them what [he&rsquo;s] actually about&rdquo; while also visiting the Nursing College on D&rsquo;Olier St. &ldquo;They should be canvassed every second day as far as I&rsquo;m concerned &ndash;during the year by the SU &ndash; because we don&rsquo;t do enough of it.&rdquo;\n\nLenihan refused to pay much heed to a pre-campaigning poll by The Campanile Electoral Survey which placed him in a commanding lead. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very early days, not many people did it. I&rsquo;m not giving it that much headway&rdquo;. He also remained uncommitted with regard to tomorrow&rsquo;s agenda saying that although plans are in place, they are subject to change. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&rdquo;\n\nLylas Aljohmani&lsquo;s campaign team conducted an &ldquo;extravagant&rdquo; stunt on the opening day of campaigning in the Arts Block, set to be repeated tomorrow at 12.30 in the Dining Hall. The stunt consisted of a violinist and pianist performing a song written for campaign outlining some of the focal points of Aljohmani&rsquo;s manifesto. Despite playing the clarinet &ndash; &ldquo;but not that well!&rdquo; &ndash; the candidate&rsquo;s intention is to leave the performance to the professionals.\n\nMuch like Lenihan, Aljohmani refused to be drawn on the admittedly early polling data that placed her neck and neck with Rosa Langhammer in second place. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know who voted in it &ndash; it is representative in a way but it is still early days and people hadn&rsquo;t seen our campaign at all at that stage. Hopefully anyone that has questions about policy can come up and ask them, and we can change people&rsquo;s opinions.&rdquo;\n\nAljohmani claimed that student interest on this first day has mostly revolved around the practical side of her manifesto. Focus from students has been on her intention to continue to advance college internships and health centre services, as well as the ever-ongoing concern regarding college fees &ndash; an issue not specifically included in her manifesto. The campaign is set to go live today with a video this evening.\n\nRosa Langhammer, billing herself in lecture addresses as the &ldquo;approachable president&rdquo;, campaigned from 07:00 in Halls, handing out manifestos to students boarding buses to college, before moving to the focal points of the Arts Block and Hamilton by 08:30.\u00a0&ldquo;The main idea is to get across the idea of genuine change because that&rsquo;s the whole campaign platform. I want to fulfil my manifesto; no false promises whatsoever.&rdquo;\n\nArising frequently today for Langhammer was the issue of an apparent increase in the cost of replacing a lost student card to &euro;30. The candidate plans to see how far along that decision has gone and what can be done to reverse it.\n\nUnlike her two competitors who remained coy on the issue, Langhammer declared herself pleased with the <em>Campanile Electoral Survey&rsquo;s</em> poll. &ldquo;I was in Prague with DUBES when it was going out so I only got the chance to put my own in; most of my campaign team didn&rsquo;t actually see it.&rdquo;\n\nA Langhmmer campaign video is set to go live &ldquo;tonight or tomorrow night&rdquo;. \u00a0A stunt is set for the team tomorrow with a &ldquo;chance to get your photo taken.&rdquo;\n\n<strong>Communications - </strong><em>CB</em>\n\nThe most hotly contested of the campaigns sees four candidates battle it out for the position of Communications officer. This year the triumvirate policies of SU accessibility, accountability and editorial independence of <em>The University Times</em>, and a bigger commitment to online media (the pillars of any communications campaign) have risen to the fore, with each candidate presenting their own outlook on achieving these aims.\n\nIn the Arts Block at lunchtime, Tommy Gavin was optimistic about the first day of campaigning; &ldquo;people are receiving us well and we&rsquo;re driving our message home for the week. We&rsquo;re also planning some cool online stuff to interact with students in the week&rdquo;. Gavin&rsquo;s campaign appears to have a strong online focus from the off, as he was among the first candidates to reveal his campaign video, and we will have to wait for more through the week.\n\nSpeaking to him on the other side of campus, Matthew Taylor was positive about his campaign; &ldquo;people seem interested in what we have to say. We just have to keep everything fresh.&rdquo; Maybe the unique A4 leaflet is doing the trick. Taylor also noted the early success of the entire campaign week, in particular &ldquo;students seem to be reacting well to all of the campaigners&rdquo;, adding the proviso, &ldquo;it is only Monday.&rdquo; Taylor too has planned a number of stunts for later in the week, and a video release soon.\n\nRicky McCormick focused his day on addressing students in their lecture theatres. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a campaign on communication issues, so it&rsquo;s important to actually get out and communicate with students. There&rsquo;s only so much handing out leaflets you can do.&rdquo; He was pleased with the general campaign on day one, reflecting other candidates views of interest from the student body, and hopes that his stunts, later in the week, will capture the imagination of the students.\n\nLeanna Byrne unveiled one of her biggest campaign weapons on day one. In addition to her campaigning in lecture theatres, she revealed a prototype app for <em>The University Times</em> which is available to view from her campaign team. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of good feedback for the app through the team, and we&rsquo;re trying to keep our momentum and freshness throughout the week. Byrne will continue her online campaign with another video, and says we can expect a stunt &ldquo;on Wednesday.&rdquo;\n\n<strong>Ents - </strong><em>SC &amp; CK</em>\n\nFollowing David Whelan&rsquo;s uncontested campaign last year, all eyes were on the Ents race as the SU election campaigning got underway today.\n\nCameron McCauley entered Day 1 of campaigning with an extremely positive attitude. Campaign manager Paul Testar, commenting on McCauley&rsquo;s lack of presence in the Arts Block early this morning stated that &ldquo;Cameron assumed that by his poster looking nicest on the noticeboards&hellip; that was kind of the whole [Ents] matter settled.&rdquo; With his pledge to &ldquo;Cut the library, cut welfare, cut the bullshit&rdquo; McCauley continued to push his &ldquo;The Party CANNOT stop&rdquo; slogan with his first campaign video. Testar declared that &ldquo;Cameron will not stop running around college until the electorate is freed from the clutches of the &lsquo;Banter Vacuum&rsquo;- the Trinity Library - and it is closed permanently, forever, at 9.45PM.&rdquo;\n\nElsewhere in the race, Conor Shmeesh Gleeson was the first of the Ents candidates to release his campaign video, &ldquo;Just Shmayin&rsquo; &rdquo;, a parody on the popular &ldquo;Just Sayin&rsquo; &rdquo; YouTube phenomenon. Like its predecessor, the video has gone viral and has been picked up by JOE.ie. Campaign manager David (Shme)Egan told <em>The University Times</em>, &ldquo;[We&rsquo;ve] been getting messages from all over from people who said they loved it! Even a status from JOE.ie saying they'll vote for him [which] was hilarious!&rdquo; Amid the controversy as to whether the Shmeesh team have been &ldquo;buying likes&rdquo; for their Facebook page, Egan has stated that &ldquo;We're stunned at the Facebook page! [It] Went completely viral too, and even everyone in Sligo has gotten right behind him!&rdquo; Earlier today Newswhip reported the video as trending in Ireland.\n\nHaving topped Friday&rsquo;s <em>Campanile Electoral Study</em> poll with with 34.7%, Ents candidate Sean Reynolds has also experienced a fruitful first day of campaigning. Despite briefly taking part in a &lsquo;power-nap&rsquo; as he grows accustomed to the rigors of the trail, Reynolds claimed the largest presence of canvassers and campaigners on campus amongst the Ents candidatess. Fellow candidate and competitor Cian Mulville will be attending the Reynolds-organized event in Trinity Halls tonight, and his closest challenger (according to the CES poll) Conor &lsquo;Shmeesh&rsquo; Gleeson is currently under investigation by the Electoral Commission on suspicion of buying &lsquo;Likes&rsquo; for his &lsquo;Shmeesh for Ents&rsquo; Facebook page, a possibility which leaves Reynolds&rsquo; team &lsquo;startled&rsquo;. All in all, a promising first foray into the race for Reynolds.\n\nCian Mulville today sought to respond strongly to the results of the<em> Campanile Electoral Study</em> poll ahead of what is sure to be a nervy night for the man. Tonight, Mulville faces the consequences of his Rag Week pledge and will be tattooed with a slogan or image selected by his charitable contributors. If nothing else, it will garner both publicity and interest in the Mulville campaign. Mulville ended his day with an appearance on Trinity FM&rsquo;s Drivetime alongside another prospective Ents officer, Cameron McAuley. Mulville used his time on air to champion his idea of inter-varsity LGBT nights, events dedicated to raising money for the Student Hardship Fund and buses to and from Trinity Halls for Ents nights.\n\n<strong>Education - </strong><em>BP</em>\n<div>All three Education candidates were prominent in the Arts Block and Hamilton today. On his campaign plans, Eric Tebay told <em>The University Times</em>\u00a0\"I'll be giving lecture addresses and meeting the voters one-on-one. In terms of what I'd like students to know is that I decided to run for this position three years ago. As such all of my experience in the SU and all the positions I've held have been specifically geared towards an education background. Even right now as EMS faculty Convenor I sit on numerous college committees, coordinate large numbers of class reps and deal with individual academic casework, basically what an education officer does but just for the EMS students. Finally out of the 15 candidates I am the only one from the EMS faculty. Therefore Hamilton students will benefit from me being elected moreso than Jack or John.\"</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>A spokesperson for Jack Leahy said the candidate was very happy with the day's work.\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">\"Our on-the-ground presence was strong throughout the day, our campaigners were hugely enthusiastic and we got a great response for students we spoke to today, both in person and through lecture addresses. In reaction to the results of last night's <em>Campanile Electoral Study</em> poll, the spokesperson said the Leahy campaign's confidence was \"buoyed\" by the results. Despite being on the receiving end of a hefty fine from the Electoral Commission last night, a fine which has resulted in a limiting of the Leahy campaign's online presence, the spokesperson said their campaign had not been significantly affected. \"</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Our quick reaction to the EC's decision last night also appears to not have greatly hindered efforts so far and the positive response only makes us look forward to the rest of the campaign even more.</span></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>John Curtin was also happy with the response by voters on the ground today : \"Day one was very encouraging, especially with the level of interest in my manifesto on issues such as more exchange programmes and christmas exams.\" \u00a0In the coming days, Curtin and his team will be concentrating their efforts on off-campus locations, primarily D'Olier street and St. James' hospital. Speaking to <em>The University Times</em>, Curtin said that his main focus for tomorrow is \"building momentum\" and seeking to garner a similar response from voters as today.</div>\n</div>\n<strong>Welfare -<em>RO'K</em></strong>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Despite being the only candidate for Welfare, Stephen Garry \u00a0is determined to prove to the electorate that he is fit for the position. Speaking with him today he said he was &lsquo;delighted with how today went, great start to the campaign and looking forward to the rest of the week. Responses on the ground were positive to the manifesto ideas and experience and the campaign team played a blinder!</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The three main points of his campaign are &lsquo;Campaigns&rsquo;, &lsquo;Collaboration&rsquo; and &lsquo;Support&rsquo;.\u00a0These include new initiatives such as &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Walk Home Alone&rsquo; and &lsquo;Cycle to College&rsquo;, hosting online campaigns, helpful workshops, training sessions in conjunction with college staff and live chat support services.</span>\n\nGarry was quick to stress that despite running an uncontested race, his team would still be out to win every vote. \"Even though we're running an uncontested campaign, we can't take anything for granted so we'll be working as hard as we can to ensure that students are informed of my experience and ideas\"", "Imageurl": "14716", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14704", "Heading": "Trinity Elects: Day One"}
