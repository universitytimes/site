{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This year&rsquo;s cohort of class reps was told to expect a significant raise in the student registration fee as well as major cutbacks in student support services in the upcoming Budget, which will be delivered on December 7th.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Speaking to the gathering of new class reps at their training weekend in Balbriggan, Union of Students in Ireland Officers outlined the severe blows that students should expect to take in the Budget for 2011. Top of the list was the now almost inevitable raise in the student registration charge, which is expected to be raised from &euro;1500 to &euro;3000. C&oacute;n&aacute;n O&rsquo;Broin, USI Deputy President said that the scale of the financial crisis and its implications for students had yet to dawn on most of the student body.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">In an interview with The University Times &Oacute; Broin said that &ldquo;The Government is desperate for money, and if students don&rsquo;t put up a fight the registration fee will definitely go up. Students are seen as a soft target. A hit on students is perceived to have no great political consequences.&rdquo; &Oacute; Broin explained that there is a &ldquo;perception that students don&rsquo;t vote whereas a significant number of pensioners vote. Government TD&rsquo;s have told us explicitly that they are afraid of targeting pensioners.&rdquo; During his presentation to the class reps &Oacute; Broin revealed that Finian Mc Grath, the Independent Dublin TD had told USI that he received 584 phone calls in 48 hours when it was announced that medical cards for over-70s would be cut. He said that if students are serious about protecting their interests then a similarly proactive attitude is required. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Speaking about the scale of the cuts which students should expect in the Budget, &Oacute; Broin said that he had been told by a Government TD in July that &euro;270 million would need to cut from the Department of Education&rsquo;s budget.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">\n</span></p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This figure has since been revised upwards twice and</span><span class=\"s2\"> </span><span class=\"s1\">now stands at &euro;400-500 million. &Oacute; Broin didn&rsquo;t rule out the likelihood of the figure being revised upwards again to roughly &euro;600 million.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Put in context, &euro;500 million represents 28% of the &euro;1.8 billion which is open to cuts in the Departments, with the remainder of its &euro;9 billion budget spent on wages and pensions, which are untouchable under the terms of the Croke Park agreement.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A likely victim of these cuts will be the student grant which was cut by 5% in last year&rsquo;s Budget. &Oacute; Broin and USI believe that the grant could suffer a cut of up to 10% in the coming Budget. Since last year&rsquo;s grant cut USI has been inundated with students telling them that they have had to drop out of college and sign on the dole. It&rsquo;s estimated that there are between 70,000-100,000 graduates aged between 20-25 on the dole, a far higher proportion than in any other demographic.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&Oacute; Broin explains that he has heard stories from students who are forced to live on &euro;18 a week, sustained only by a meagre &euro;400 grant that has to last them three months. A female student recently contacted USI to plead for help because she was limited to spending &euro;1 a day on food. The former TCDSU President calls this is an intolerable situation, one which will only be made worse by the seemingly inevitable cuts. Citing the Irish Independent&rsquo;s report on students turning to stripping and prostitution to pay their way through college, &Oacute; Broin says that a student living on the grant is essentially living below the poverty line as the grant is far less generous than social welfare payments.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One group of students who are likely to face a bleak future after the Budget are TAP students who rely on the Student Support Fund to attend college. The Student Support Fund, according to SU Welfare Officer, Steph Fleming, would suffer if a cut to the grant were to be implemented. This could result in 150 of Trinity&rsquo;s students facing up to the realisation that a college education is no longer financially viable.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To combat these cuts and the raising of the registration charge USI has called on all undergraduate students to march on the D&aacute;il on November 3rd.&nbsp; USI hopes to have at least 25,000 students in attendance.</span></p>\n\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This year&rsquo;s cohort of class reps was told to expect a significant raise in the student registration fee as well as major cutbacks in student support services in the upcoming Budget, which will be delivered on December 7th.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">Speaking to the gathering of new class reps at their training weekend in Balbriggan, Union of Students in Ireland Officers outlined the severe blows that students should expect to take in the Budget for 2011.
