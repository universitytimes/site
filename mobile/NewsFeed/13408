It begins at the <strong>Garden of Remembrance</strong> on Parnell Street at <strong>4pm</strong> with an address and will proceed to the <strong>D\u00e1il</strong> on Kildare Street at <strong>5pm</strong>. There, protesters will light candles in solidarity and call on the government to legislate for the X Case, which in 1992 saw the Supreme Court rule that the constitution allowed for a woman to have an abortion in Ireland when the pregnancy represented a 'real and substantial' risk to her life.", "Imageurl": "13409", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13408", "Heading": "LIVE: March for Savita"}
