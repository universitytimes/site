The development will be situated\u00a0in the technology sector of campus along Pearse Street, Dublin.\r\n\r\nWork is expected to begin in Summer 2014, with completion anticipated in 2017. The project aims\u00a0to support the increasingly entrepreneurial culture among Trinity&rsquo;s students and faculties, drive job\u00a0creation across campus and in the city centre, and establish Dublin as a global hub for innovation\u00a0and start-up enterprises.\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">&ldquo;Trinity is a university that educates and motivates students to create jobs, as well as\u00a0to get them.\"</blockquote>\r\nDr. Patrick Prendergast, the Provost of Trinity, made the announcement at the Trinity Global\u00a0Graduate Forum, which hosted over 100 of the university's most successful alumni in Dublin this\u00a0weekend. The forum is the first time a university has invited its global graduates back to discuss\u00a0various issues, with representatives from sixteen countries and nineteen professions in attendance.\r\n\r\nThe two-day event discussed plans to tackle many of the steepest challenges facing modern higher\u00a0education, including growth, funding, reputation, education and technology.\r\n\r\nDr. Prendergast stated that the new School of Business was evidence that Trinity is committed to\u00a0investing in innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as facilitating Ireland's social and economic\u00a0development.\r\n\r\n&ldquo;Trinity is a university that educates and motivates students to create jobs, as well as\u00a0to get them,&rdquo; Dr. Prendergast said. He further cited the importance of cooperation between higher\u00a0education institutions and the government in creating an environment that promotes &ldquo;innovation,\u00a0entrepreneurship, and new business creation&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nFollowing its proposed completion in 2017, it is expected that the Trinity School of Business will\u00a0provide a full range of business-related programmes at undergraduate, postgraduate and executive\u00a0education levels. The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Hub will provide a home for prototyping and\u00a0company incubation projects, as well as academic and administrative offices.\r\n\r\nThe overall development will cover approximately 13,000 square metres, with six storeys\u00a0above ground and three below. It will comprise a 600-seat auditorium, a restaurant capable of\u00a0accommodating 200 people, public space for students, &lsquo;smart&rsquo; classrooms outfitted with the latest\u00a0digital technology, and a rooftop conference room.\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">New School &ldquo;can be the\u00a0physical home of Ireland&rsquo;s new generation of job creators&rdquo;.</blockquote>\r\nThe &euro;70 million required to cover the project's costs has been partially acquired from philanthropic\u00a0sources, with plans to raise more in both private and public ventures. Other revenue sources include\u00a0self-generated income from fee-paying business programmes, and income from the sale of off-campus office space and the leasing of retail units and student apartments.\r\n\r\nThese developments come as part of a new approach to entrepreneurship and innovation training\u00a0throughout the university. According to Se\u00e1n Melly, Chairman of the Business School Advisory Board\u00a0and Managing Director of Powerscourt Capital Partners, the new School of Business &ldquo;can be the\u00a0physical home of Ireland&rsquo;s new generation of job creators&rdquo;. Melly claimed that, with this project,\u00a0Trinity paves the way for future economic growth, helping to &ldquo;renew our society and our economy&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nSpeaking on behalf of the college, Dr. Prendergast also stated that Trinity &ldquo;believes it can play\u00a0a key role in creating a vibrant and successful society and economy&rdquo;. Now in its fifth century as a\u00a0leading higher education institution, Dr. Prendergast acknowledged Trinity's increasing efforts to\u00a0combine its &ldquo;traditional strengths in education and research with innovation and entrepreneurship\u00a0in a world of relentless change&rdquo;.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/trinity11.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21677", "Heading": "Trinity Announces New &euro;70 Million Business School and Innovation Hub"}
