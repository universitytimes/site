The e-mail said that College had approved a new system of mandatory surveys of individual class or module groups. These surveys were to happen in an online, centralized procedure every one to three years.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In this new system academics will be given the option to author their own survey.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Alternatively, they can take part in the College process where persons with relevant responsibility would author one for them. The e-mail was clear that questionnaires were the &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; method but did say that others &ldquo;may be employed in the future&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">However, a number of academics have spoken to The University Times to convey their dissatisfaction with the arrangement. One of the problems outlined was that while the survey was mandatory for academics, students were free to decide whether to do it or not.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&ldquo;Online surveys of this nature,&rdquo; one source said, &ldquo;will almost certainly get a very low rate of response from students. Academics are in the position of having to go through the process of surveying their students&hellip; [and] if they are really interested in the the accuracy of the outcome, they will want to write their own surveys. But after spending that time there will be no compulsion for students to answer, and students are busier and busier today, so I understand that they wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Another source highlighted the potentially dispiriting outcome of the process. &ldquo;College raised recently, I believe fairly, the issue of stress-testing of their academic survey. The same issue will apply here. Students will take the survey in lower numbers and the likely majority that were satisfied with the course will be less incentivised to respond than those who strongly disliked, or even liked, the course. But students are a grumpy bunch, especially when discussing their lecturers!&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The University Times was given access to some of the proposed survey formats and problems became obvious. It was apparently possible for a student who had a series of lecturers during a module to be asked questions about them in general. Questionnaires had numerous references to &ldquo;lecturer(s)&rdquo;. This raises questions about how survey accuracy and effectiveness. Being asked to grade the average performance of lecturers across a module would likely give a poor insight into individual performance.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">It would appear that the new mandatory student surveys are College&rsquo;s response to the difficult issue of internal feedback. While many academics have long-standing practices of producing their own student satisfaction surveys, the university has come in for criticism for not having a more established and strategic system for gaining feedback from students.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In 2004/05, the European Universities Association reviewed Irish universities in an &ldquo;Institutional Evaluation Programme&rdquo;. The conclusions of its report were highly critical in the area of feedback. In a comparison the report indicated that major Irish universities like Trinity College were behind European universities of the same calibre in this field. A failure to establish a formal process for acquiring that feedback was specifically highlighted. The issue of student satisfaction with College standards of teaching is particularly important in the current climate. In our last issue, The University Times revealed the existence of an academic survey which showed a large majority of academics felt that they had less time for teaching.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&ldquo;That survey was important,&rdquo; our source felt, &ldquo;and it said something about the way the restructuring process was put in place. But now we are instituting a new survey system that is mandatory for all academics. Some of the same mistakes are being made. It looks a bit like a token measure meant to satisfy criticism, or at least obfuscate the issue. Student satisfaction with their standard of education should be more important than that.&rdquo;</span></p>", "Imageurl": "9135", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/survey-software3", "ID": "784", "Heading": "Mandatory student surveys questioned"}
