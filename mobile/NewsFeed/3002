Nikolai Trigoub-Rotnem, president of TCD&rsquo;s SU, and members of numerous college societies, such as the Hist and the Phil, were among the main delegates of the student body at the event with several media outlets covering the proceedings.\n\nDuring the function, pre-vetted members of students and staff of Trinity College were allowed amass behind secure barriers outside the back entrance to the Book of Kells, the same area that Queen Elizabeth had first arrived. The black Range Rover, which had initially transported the Queen to \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, was parked at the other end of the barriers, allowing for the Queen an opportunity to chat with the patient group.\n\nRebecca Kilkelly, a fourth year Sociology and French student, was entrusted with the task of handing over a bouquet of flowers to Queen Elizabeth on behalf of TCD. On returning from the Old Library, the Queen, along with her husband Prince Phillip, accepted the flowers and proceeded to engage in conversation with the enthused collective.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Rebecca explained both her conversation with the Queen and why she was initially chosen for the role. &ldquo;My great-grandmother in 1901 met Queen Victoria and gave her flowers also. So I told that story and she commented that we&rsquo;d obviously missed a generation, and then the Duke asked what I was studying here, and that was pretty much it.&rdquo;\n\nThe visit signified the end to what had been a day of great historic importance, both for the Republic of Ireland and neighbouring Britain. Having begun her 4 day tour in \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, the Queen was then driven to the Garden of Remembrance, where she laid a wreath in memory of those who fought for Irish independence.\n\nThe visit also marks a high point in relations between Britain and Ireland. Mary McAleese, on welcoming the queen, commented that Britain and Ireland were ``determined to make the future a much, much better place.''\n\nTomorrow the Queen will visit the Guinness brewery as well as giving a public speech from Dublin Castle. She will then finish her state visit in Tipperary and Cork.\n\nPeter Twomey", "Imageurl": "3024", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "3002", "Heading": "Queen Elizabeth II visits Trinity College"}
