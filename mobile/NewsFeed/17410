But officials are now looking at a straight cut to the grant, which for full applicants amounts to &euro;3,025, in the Budget.\n\nThe student maintenance grant is paid to about 100,000 students each year and the Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), expects to have 75,000 new applications and 25,000 renewal applications in the coming academic year.\n\nOfficials involved in the Budget process have warned that cuts of &euro;106 million will have to be made in the Education Department.\n\nUSI President Joe O&rsquo;Connor said &ldquo;Let there be no doubt that our members will organise and firmly oppose any attempt to further cut the maintenance grant. The Government and Minister Quinn must be aware that students will not take this lying down, and will take their opposition to the streets, to constituency offices and to the ballot box.\n\nEarlier this week, the USI announced the Student Electoral Registration Database (SERD) ahead of a massive planned voter registration drive. 50,000 student voters will be registered this year, joining 120,000+ students already on the electoral register. These voters will be connected directly with their local politicians through a high-tech database management and communication tool.\n\nUSI&rsquo;s National Campaign, &lsquo;Fight For Your Future Now&rsquo;, was also launched this week, which will see students right across the country display vigorous opposition to any attempts to further target third-level student supports by the Government.", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/NWS_20130818_ANA_008_28618432_I1.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "17410", "Heading": "Quinn To Roll Out Further Third Level Cut Backs"}
