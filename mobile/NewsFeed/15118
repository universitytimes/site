Photo:\u00a0The University Observer[/caption]\n\n<strong>Jack Leahy | </strong>News editor\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">University College Dublin Students' Union (UCDSU) President Rachel Breslin has announced on her personal Facebook page that she supports her Union's continued affiliation to the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) subject to the achievement of particular reforms within the national union.</span>\n\nThe five-point list of reforms, which has been agreed to by USI President John Logue and USI presidential candidate Joe O'Connor, calls for direct election of the USI President from 2014, a reformed campaigns structure, strict stipulations regarding mandates issued by local unions, a review of the\u00a0affiliation\u00a0fee structure, and the employment of a Policy and Political Advisor.\n\nBreslin's announcement was made on the eve of the first of two days of voting and aligns the former Welfare Officer with her sabbatical colleagues in Education (Shane Comer) and Campaigns &amp; Communications (Paddy Guiney). Ents Officer Eoin Heffernan has played an active role in the 'no2usi' campaign, while incumbent Welfare Officer M\u00edchael Gallagher has remained neutral publicly.\n\nIn the same post, Breslin warns that she will 'fully support' any disaffiliation referendum arising from failure to act upon these proposed reforms within 12 months.\n\nCampaigns &amp; Communications Officer Paddy Guiney is the only UCDSU sabbatical officer to play an active role in the 'yes2usi' campaign. An article in UCD's\u00a0<em>The University Observer</em> last week claimed that Guiney had been<a href=\"http://www.universityobserver.ie/2013/02/20/guiney-accused-of-canvassing-for-usi-on-su-time/\"> 'canvassing for USI on SU time'</a> against the rules of referenda, a claim that Guiney refutes. Guiney told\u00a0<em>The University Times</em> last week that he had taken a period of leave to allow him to focus on the campaign.\n\nWriting on her personal Facebook page on an increasingly divisive and heated campaign, Breslin stated that she sought to contribute to a debate which had become 'skewed from the real issues':\n\n'When I first said I would call a referendum on USI affiliation it was always my intention to stay out of the debate. However, despite both sides making valid points I think the debate has become skewed from the real issues. I have at all times made clear my belief in a national union and national representation for UCD students.\n\n'Having thought deeply about the current structures in USI, and what would happen in UCD if we disaffiliated I believe we need to remain affiliated with USI but that we need to see urgent reform of the organisation. By advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote from UCD, and in response to the issues raised by UCD students over the past number of weeks, I have agreed a set of reforms UCD students need to see with the USI President, John Logue, and Presidential candidate, Joe O&rsquo;Connor.\n\n'The implementation of these reforms will determine UCD Students&rsquo; Union&rsquo;s position in the national students&rsquo; union over the 12 months ahead.\n\n'The greatest mischaracterisation of all is that USI does nothing or has achieved nothing. Without USI we would be paying higher fees, Yes, USI has made decisions and run campaigns that I don&rsquo;t agree with, but there is no such thing as a perfect organisation. I&rsquo;m not voting yes because it&rsquo;s the only option we have, I&rsquo;m voting yes because I believe that with reform from members it can be the best organisation we could possibly have representing UCD students.'\n\nAn explanation of the reforms can be found <a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=15120\">here</a>.\n\nNo representative of the 'No' side was available for comment.\n\n<strong>Three student bodies to vote this week</strong>\n<strong></strong>In addition to the high-profile and often controversial referendum in UCD, students in NUI Maynooth and Dublin City University will also be asked to consider their Union's relationship with USI this week.\n\nNUI Maynooth Students' Union is currently an affiliate of USI, while DCUSU is one of the largest non-affiliates alongside the University of Limerick.\n\nDCU students will have the opportunity to vote on Tuesday 26th and Wednesday 27th February alongside a 'Reproductive Rights Referendum', while NUIM students can vote on Wednesday 27th.", "Imageurl": "15121", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15118", "Heading": "UCDSU President 'Agrees USI Reforms' as Students Vote on Affiliation"}
