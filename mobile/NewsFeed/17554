We found the growth of the NaCl wires by chance &ndash; researchers were working on the project, and, while analysing the gel material, they noticed and monitored over time the growth of unusual structures and realised that they were observing new and fascinating structures not previously reported. The fact it turned out to be table salt took us by surprise.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Professor Gunnlaugsson, an Icelandic researcher and a member of the Supramolecular and Medicinal Chemistry Research Group at Trinity's School of Chemistry, worked with Professor John Boland, who is the Director of Trinity's Centre for Research on Adaptive Nanostructures and Nanodevices, on the discovery. Professors Gunnlaugsson and Boland also co-authored a study of the findings in ACS Nano, the highly respected journal for nanoscientific projects, which was published online last May and in the journal's print edition in June.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The process used to grow the wires generates an insight into how the growth of crystals can be controlled on the nano-scale, Professor Gunnlaugsson stated.</p>\n&ldquo;Wires of all kinds will enable us to miniaturise structures and possibly build functional structures on the nano-scale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And being able to grow such wires in a systematic and controlled manner would be a revolutionary step.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/nn-2012-05813y_0008.gif", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "17554", "Heading": "Trinity Professors Pioneer &ldquo;Revolutionary&rdquo; Development in Nanoscience"}
