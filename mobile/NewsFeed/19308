{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Prominent Dublin MEP Emer Costello has described youth unemployment in Ireland as &ldquo;the greatest crisis we face&rdquo; and called on the government to use a wide variety of resources to address the problem.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking at the Youth Guarantee Conference in Dun Laoghaire yesterday, Labour MEP Costello stressed that it was crucial for government to fully utilise EU programmes made available to tackle the issue of youth unemployment. While overall unemployment in Ireland has remained stubbornly at around 14% since the onset of the economic crisis, the rate of unemployment among youths is substantially higher. As many as one in four under-25s are out of work, with some 62,000 young people unable to find jobs. Costello described such figures as a &ldquo;human tragedy&rdquo; and stated that the only way to reduce joblessness was to take inspiration from the best-practice standards in Nordic countries and introduce a &ldquo;rights-based approach to youth unemployment&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The European Youth Guarantee is aimed at ensuring that a young unemployed person is offered high-quality employment, continued education, a traineeship, or an apprenticeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education&rdquo;, she said. &ldquo;The idea has been championed at European level for a number of years by Labour and its sister parties in the Party of European Socialists. It was then taken up by the European Commission, which issued proposals last December for a Europe-wide framework to implement the programme&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ms. Costello stated that the first such programme in Ireland would commence in Ballymun soon. She also highlighted the importance of what she termed &ldquo;quality internships&rdquo; for young people, and gave her support to a European framework for minimum standards in traineeships to ensure such positions are not open to abuse.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0bjdLdFTKYd2dq1Da9UNGDG7fuanCKD5wQi3CaW7KXXd0lby5rE50vWx2nRqWcU9ScNordKBsNagcFSZqNUUlWpr9kHD8yKVFCZHaIM-BS-n0Yj3IOc54CaM\" width=\"714px;\" height=\"476px;\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The conference heard that last year, T\u00e1naiste Eamon Gilmore negotiated that at least &euro;6 billion in funding would be available across the EU to help create jobs among young people. Ireland&rsquo;s allocation of the funding would depend on the Commission&rsquo;s view of the effectiveness of proposals to be submitted this December, as well as the country&rsquo;s ability to co-finance the project.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eamon Gilmore rejected claims that Ireland was allowing emigration to deal with the issue of youth unemployment and rebuffed criticism from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation Development (OECD) that the problem was not being considered. Speaking at the event yesterday, the T\u00e1naiste told reporters that the only way to tackle youth unemployment was through job creation, and that over 30,000 jobs were created last year.</p>\r\nThe Youth Guarantee Conference came in the same week that the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) announced its co-operation with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and the Irish Second-Level Students Union (ISSU) on the question of youth unemployment. At the launch of their publication &ldquo;Locked Out - Investing in a Future for Youth&rdquo;, ICTU&rsquo;s Youth Committee representative Lorraine Mulligan said that a clear strategy, including a Youth Guarantee, was needed.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/jobless.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19308", "Heading": "Dublin MEP: Irish Youth Unemployment is &ldquo;The Greatest Crisis We Face&rdquo;"}
