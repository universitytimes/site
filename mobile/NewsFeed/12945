This followed several complaints by disabled students who felt excluded from societal events.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The recommendation, since withdrawn, came despite statistics shown to the same committee concerning the current levels of accessibility around campus which suggest that it is often difficult for societies to secure suitable rooms. The 2011/12 report on Trinity&rsquo;s progress relating to the Disability Act 2005 states that &ldquo;the Built environment [of college] remains a priority with 23% of buildings compliant with Accessibility Legislation (Disability Act 2005), 40% accessible at entrance level only and 37% inaccessible.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The GMB, built in the late 1600s and home to two of the college&rsquo;s oldest student societies (the Phil and the Hist), is among those buildings accessible only on the ground floor. Furthermore, included in these statistics are some historical and many older buildings around college which are more difficult to alter, and liability issues &ndash; as in most universities &ndash;prevent the majority of societies from holding events off-campus.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It was also accordingly at the same meeting that the Capitations Committee draw up a Code of Conduct for student societies, particularly relating to event accessibility. This committee, chaired by the Senior Dean, includes in its terms of reference a large number of student representatives who sit on the executives of the five capitated bodies.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Treanor announced his support for this move, saying: &ldquo;With over 1100 disabled students studying in College, the need for inclusive clubs and societies is good for the whole community. I know the Equality Committee raised this last year and it is due to come up again at its first meeting this month.&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Commenting on the figures relating to accessibility, Treanor said that he had &lsquo;queried&rsquo; them at the time of their publication, and the criteria on which they were based, denying that these are adequate grounds for holding inaccessible events. &lsquo;I would find it hard to believe there wouldn&rsquo;t be space on campus. There is now an accessibility map of college available, and societies can ring the office to find available rooms that are accessible.&rsquo; Qualifying that the introduction of fines for non-compliant societies should be a last resort, he also said that when questioning &lsquo;who is responsible&rsquo; for non-inclusiveness of events, it has to be noted that &lsquo;if people want to be inclusive, they will try to be inclusive.&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Joseph O&rsquo;Gorman, Strategic Development Officer of the Central Societies Committee, said that &lsquo;The CSC is cognisant of the need to consider the issue of accessibility to events&hellip; There is an average of 120 to 130 society events on campus over the five-day teaching week in parallel with an ever expanding full-time student lecture day and a growing number of evening courses and classes... Curricular activity is, quite naturally, prioritised over extracurricular activity. Much space available to societies is not accessible.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&lsquo;Most societies find it extremely difficult to find space for events and make do with what they can find. The outcome of this is that not all society activity can be accessible.&rsquo; However, O&rsquo;Gorman denied that a code was being set out, stating that &lsquo;College is responsible for the accessibility of its buildings, not the CSC.&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&lsquo;The CSC does not have in place, nor is it its intention to put in place, a system to fine Societies with respect to the accessibility of events because the degree of accessibility of the space to which the Societies have access is beyond the control of the Societies and the CSC.&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ian Beatty-Orr, Captain of the Dublin University Rifle Club, also commented on the subject of event accessibility: &lsquo;Due to the old nature of campus many club and society rooms are inaccessible and so numerous that to avoid their use altogether is just not feasible. \u00a0Sports clubs in particular often have specialist rooms and can't conduct their sports in other locations, for instance we most certainly couldn't shoot safely or legally anywhere on campus other than our current range. While we are pursuing the matter of having a ramp constructed into our current range it will never be an ideal venue for wheelchair users.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&lsquo;A much better solution for us and the disabled community would be the construction of a larger fully accessible range with the space for us to expand our activities and accommodate disabled users comfortably.&rsquo; In any case the club, in its pursuit of having a ramp constructed, is &lsquo;currently being hampered by the slow response from buildings, as after their speedy initial assessment they have yet to even provide us with an estimate of the cost.&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Amanda Piesse, Dean of Students, also commented on the subject: &lsquo;I understand that the Equality Office is looking at training and awareness -raising solutions, and it is felt that if a Code of Conduct were to be developed it would need to be developed by the Capitation committee to have any validity: the Equality Officer would have a supporting role.&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Treanor supported this need for equality awareness training for society heads, declaring that &lsquo;societies cannot operate a selective membership. In many cases they are not making enough effort to attract student interest. Freshers&rsquo; Week will not suit everybody. Societies should vary the types of events offered, and perhaps appoint an equality officer.&rsquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At present, a checklist for organising events is available on the college website which includes suggestions for making meetings and receptions inclusive, and the CSC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Officers&rsquo; Guide&rsquo;, which instructs society officers on the running of their organisations, says, of accessibility: &lsquo;Please bear in mind that we must cater for those students and staff members who may have mobility impairment of some kind, so when deciding about a venue's suitability, try to ensure that the rooms you book are accessible to all.&rsquo; There is not, however, a system in place to discipline societies for holding events in buildings and rooms that are difficult to get to.</p>\nThe Equality Committee has noted that although student societies are not technically funded by College, rather by the student registration fee, they must still abide by the college&rsquo;s policies. Karen Campos McCormack, the college Equality Officer, spoke at the Committee meeting of steps being taken to ensure compliance with Trinity&rsquo;s Dignity and Respect policy and announced her support for creating further awareness about inclusiveness in student societies.", "Imageurl": "12946", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12945", "Heading": "Societies may face code of conduct"}
