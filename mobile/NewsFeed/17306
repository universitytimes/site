The research reveals that monthly living expenses for students living away from home are to amass to &euro;1000 for the first time, and it is estimated that one in 12 students will drop out of college this year as a result of this increased financial strain.\n\nO&rsquo;Connor stated, &ldquo;Students are being forced to work lengthy hours in low-paid part-time jobs to get themselves through college, in many cases with a negative effect on their study time and academic output&hellip;The crisis in youth mental health issues in this country is being accentuated by the financial burden which many vulnerable students are having to bear in their pursuit of a college degree.&rdquo;\n\nThe study also shows that eight out of 10 Irish parents are supporting their children with university living costs, with 40% of these doing so out of their life savings and 25% borrowing from credit unions. \n<blockquote>Students are currently working an average of 18 \u02dd hours a week to cope with the mounting expenses, leading to concerns about stress levels and mental health.</blockquote>\nThe situation has been aggravated in recent years due to delays in the receipt of grants, as well as the rising student contribution charge which will stretch to &euro;2500 this September. This will reach &euro;2750 in 2014 and &euro;3000 the following year. 71% of parents told researchers that that their family budgets would be negatively impacted by this rise.\n\n&ldquo;This is about more than vulnerable students,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor insisted. &ldquo;Parents and families up and down the country, determined to see their sons and daughters through third-level education as they see the value that it brings, are clearly making enormous sacrifices in order to bring this about&hellip;The increasing borrowing of these parents highlighted in the survey continues a worrying trend whereby the most vulnerable families are trapped in a spiral of more and more debt.\n\n&ldquo;Any further increases in the costs of college through increased student charges or reductions in the maintenance grant will merely serve to further attack struggling families already crippled by wider recessionary measures.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130813-212451.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "17306", "Heading": "Monthly Student Expenses to Reach &euro;1000; USI Responds"}
