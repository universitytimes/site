Walsh has a special affiliation with Trinity, having completed his Masters here. In my view, he&rsquo;s one of Ireland&rsquo;s most esteemed businessmen and hearing about his experiences in one of the world&rsquo;s most competitive industries is sure to be a great treat for all those in attendance at the forum.\n\nThe arline chief is the latest in a series of notable figures from the fields of politics, economics and business to be confirmed to speak at the forum.\n\n<em>The University Times</em> understands that T\u00e1naiste and current Minister for Foreign Affairs Eamon Gilmore is also set to speak at the event.

The two day event was opened by President Michael D. Higgins, and attended by over 200 students from Trinity and surrounding colleges. This year the forum is to double in size, following successful feedback from last year&rsquo;s event and increased sponsorship from PricewaterhouseCoopers and Citi group.
