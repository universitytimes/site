Speaking to this reporter, a college spokesperson stated that the woman 'had interfered with a laptop that did not belong to her'. College also confirmed the individual in question is not a student of the college.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She was escorted to Front Arch security booth and subsequently arrested and detained at Pearse St, Garda Station. The individual in question was positively identified by College Security as someone being sought in relation to previous alleged thefts on campus.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The Garda Press Office has confirmed that the woman, believed to be in her early thirties was charged with attempted theft.
