The project will be carried out by Occupational Therapists and a specialised Careers Advisor who will train students in the skills and strategies needed for employment.</span></p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Declan Treanor, Director of the Disability Service, stated: &ldquo;A key element of the Disability Service&rsquo;s Strategic Plan 2011-2014... is progression into employment for students with disabilities.</span>\n<blockquote><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">\"This Genio grant will enable the development of a model of support for students and graduates with mental health difficulties in their transition to employment.&rdquo;</span></blockquote>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">The past decade has seen a marked increase in the number of students with disabilities - and the number of these suffering from mental health issues - progressing through third-level education. Yet research has shown that unemployment rates for this group have remained high.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&ldquo;This is an innovative project between two Trinity College Services; the Disability Service and Careers Advisory Service and an academic discipline - Occupational Therapy,&rdquo; Treanor outlined. &ldquo;This project will also form alliances with other colleges as the project will be rolled out across other Higher Education Institutes in the greater Dublin region&hellip; It is a timely initiative with the recent announcement of the development of a National Comprehensive Employment Strategy for people with disabilities. It will also allow Trinity College to deliver on the College Access &amp; Strategic Plan.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Sean Gannon, Director of the Careers Advisory Service added: &ldquo;All people are employable and everyone needs to have a chance to play a role in society. In the case of students and graduates with disabilities, their huge potential is often masked by the disability. It is very difficult to sustain confidence and to be self-supporting in the face of multiple rejections.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&ldquo;The role of the specialist careers advisor will be to provide an individualised service to students and graduates to help them to define what they want and what they can do as well as helping them to successfully make the transition to the right job. Many employers want to support people with disabilities but often they too need guidance and advice. Our objective will be to work in partnership with employers so that a talented but often neglected group of graduates have the opportunity to fully contribute to the Irish economy and to society generally.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">The &ldquo;Transition to Employment&rdquo; project will commence in January 2014.</span>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Disability.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20267", "Heading": "Disability Service Given Genio Grant for &ldquo;Transition to Employment&rdquo; Project"}
