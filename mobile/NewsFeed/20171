{"Body": "<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><strong>Fiona Gribben</strong> | News Writer</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Trinity student Donncha O Cearbhaill and fellow computer expert Darren Martyn have been\u00a0</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">ordered to hand over &euro;5000 each to Fine Gael, with half of this amount going to charity, a judge\u00a0</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">determined yesterday.</span>\r\n\r\nThe pair were brought before Dublin District Court on charges of computer hacking. They are among the first people in the history of the state to be successfully prosecuted for such offences.\r\n\r\nJudge Ann Ryan applied the Probation Act, meaning the hackers have avoided a prison sentence and will\u00a0not have a criminal record.\r\n\r\n\"I hope both have learnt a lesson,\" Justice Ryan said, and continued to state:\r\n<blockquote>\"Such expertise should be used in the right way and I hope you do that in the\u00a0future because you have a lot to give society.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\n20-year-old O Cearbhaill from Birr, Co Offaly, is a third\u00a0year medicinal chemistry student at Trinity, while 21-year-old Martyn from Claregalway, Co Galway, studies forensic science and analysis at\u00a0Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\nUsing the online aliases Palladium and Raepsauce respectively, the duo hacked and defaced Fine Gael's website,\u00a0www.finegael2011.ie, on January 9 2011: seven weeks before the general election. Data was also\u00a0stolen from the site and published elsewhere, including the contact details of up to 2,000 of its\u00a0subscribers.\r\n\r\nFine Gael claimed that it cost &euro;10,000 euro to get the website up and running again.\r\n\r\nThe pair was initially arrested in 2012 as part of a worldwide investigation into the hacking group\u00a0Anonymous and its sister-group Lulzsec.\r\n\r\nO Cearbhaill, son of Offaly Independent Councillor John Carroll also faces separate charges of\u00a0unlawfully intercepting a conference call between an FBI official and a member of An Garda\u00a0S\u00edoch\u00e1na and subsequently posting a recording of the call on YouTube.\r\n\r\nThe duo have no previous convictions and the judge said the Probation Service's restorative justice\u00a0report had been \"very good\". Furthermore the court heard how the hacking had been \"a stunt to\u00a0embarrass a political party rather than to disclose data to the public at large.\"\r\n\r\nFine Gael has chosen to donate half of the fine to suicide prevention charity Pieta House, with the\u00a0other &euro;5000 retained by the party.\r\n\r\nThe offence, at district court level, can ordinarily result in a criminal conviction, a fine and can carry a\u00a0maximum 12-month jail term.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Hackers-split.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20171", "Heading": "Trinity Student Dodges Jail Term in Hacking Case"}
