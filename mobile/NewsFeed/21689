While broadly aimed at travellers of all ages, the campaign will\u00a0target college students and young people under the age of twenty-five as a key audience, as well as\u00a0elderly people over the age of 65. The campaign has received support from the Union of Students in\u00a0Ireland (USI) and their Vice President for Welfare, Denise McCarthy.\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">&ldquo;Younger travellers can often be\u00a0disregarded as thrill-seekers who don&rsquo;t focus on more serious travel preparations.\"</blockquote>\r\nResearch undertaken for Sanofi Pasteur MSD showed that compared to other groups, young\u00a0Irish people below under 25 are more likely to prioritise travel health. 37% of young people are more\u00a0concerned about contracting tropical diseases abroad, compared to only 21% of people aged 65 and\u00a0over. Similarly, 12% of under-25-year-olds consider travel vaccinations important, compared to 7%\u00a0of over-65-year-olds.\r\n\r\nDr Jack Lambert, Consultant in Infectious Disease at the Mater and Rotunda Hospitals and\u00a0University College Dublin, commented on the research, saying that &ldquo;Younger travellers can often be\u00a0disregarded as thrill-seekers who don&rsquo;t focus on more serious travel preparations, but this research\u00a0shows that they are the most conscious of the importance of vaccinations when travelling to exotic\u00a0parts of the world.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThere is concern, however, that figures for prioritising\u00a0vaccination are still low, a problem\u00a0that the campaign aims to rectify. Dr Lambert added that: &ldquo;The continued need for travel health\u00a0vigilance and vaccination is highlighted by the fact that one in eight people know someone who\u00a0has contracted a preventable tropical disease while abroad&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;it is essential that pre-travel advice is sought well in advance of a trip so that all medical needs and necessary preventative\u00a0precautions are discussed with a healthcare professional, leaving enough time to prepare yourself\u00a0before you travel.&rdquo;\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\"One in eight people know someone who\u00a0has contracted a preventable tropical disease while abroad.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\nThe research shows that despite the fact that one in eight Irish people know someone who\u00a0has at some stage contracted a tropical disease, less than a quarter of Irish people who travelled to\u00a0at-risk countries vaccinated against them. It was also shown that Irish people consider getting a pre-travel haircut to be a more important step in travel preparation than vaccination against tropical\u00a0diseases, with 19% choosing the former as more important.\r\n\r\nDavenport, who will be writing blogs for the campaign&rsquo;s website, praised the\u00a0campaign and highlighted the importance of practicing good travel health. &ldquo;Travel can be the most\u00a0exciting and wonderful experience,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you need to make sure you are fully prepared so\u00a0you can relax and enjoy your time away.\"\r\n\r\nThe most common travel-related diseases vaccinated against by Irish people are typhoid\u00a0fever, diphtheria, tetanus and Hepatitis types A and B.\u00a0More details can be found at www.HealthyTravel.ie", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Healthy-Travel-0168.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21689", "Heading": "New Campaign to Promote Travel Health Among Under-25s"}
