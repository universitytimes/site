The major event of the day was the protest against the opening ceremony of the Sochi Winter Olympics at the Russian Embassy, which both Jasper Pickersgill and Domhnall McGlacken-Byrne attended.\r\n\r\nThe protest had a substantial turnout. Pickersgill said that he felt this issue has become &ldquo;very personal&rdquo; to him and that it is &ldquo;pertinent to college life&rdquo;. He stated that it is something he intends to fully support if voted into office. McGlacken-Byrne said he enjoyed having the opportunity to &ldquo;not just represent Trinity students, but also broader issues&rdquo;, considering that &ldquo;people listen to Trinity students&rdquo; as they &ldquo;have a privileged public platform&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nWith regards to campaigning, both candidates mentioned the ongoing positive response to their various policies. McGlacken-Byrne travelled off-campus to St. James' this afternoon, and intends to return to D'Olier Street. Pickersgill likened the race to a rugby match, stating that we are in the &ldquo;interesting stage...getting up to half time&rdquo;. He returned to the Hamilton to continue speaking to students and addressing lectures.\r\n\r\nTomorrow, McGlacken-Byrne intends to appear at the nurses' protest against long working hours and low pay. He stated that we are &ldquo;very lucky in Trinity&rdquo;, and therefore supporting these causes is essential. Pickersgill is requesting permission from the Electoral Commission for a stunt, weather permitting, as well as organising a video to be released over the next few days.\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #8f1163;\"><strong>Communications:</strong></span></h1>\n<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0140.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-23747 aligncenter\" alt=\"DSC_0140\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0140.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" /></a>\n<strong>Paul Glynn</strong> | Senior Staff Writer\r\n\r\nToday&rsquo;s campaign saw continued effort from both Communications candidates PJ Moloney and Samuel Riggs. One of the day&rsquo;s highlights that turned out to be an important fixture for most Leadership Race candidates was the student protest for LGBT rights organised outside the Russian Embassy in Rathgar.\r\n\r\nSamuel Riggs and many members of his team joined students campaigning for other candidates, as well as current TCDSU sabbatical officers, representatives of the USI and Trinity&rsquo;s QSoc. Riggs was very positive about the protest which he said was &ldquo;fantastic&rdquo;, and was thankful to get the opportunity to meet with Joe O&rsquo;Connor, President of the USI, as well as fellow USI representative Laura Harmon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to have representatives from all of these groups see us out participating at these events,&rdquo; said Riggs.\r\n\r\nPJ Moloney was unable to attend the protest due to a clash with classes, as well as a meeting with the Student Life Committee. On the protest, Moloney believed that it was &ldquo;not as heavily attended as it could be if we can make Students&rsquo; Union communications about protests like this more lively and effective.\"\r\n\r\nBack in College, Riggs had a stand set up in the Arts Building with a promotional signboard out again for students to write on. Discussing his plans for tomorrow, Riggs said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m currently getting my head together for the Cumann Gaelach Hustings tomorrow evening, which I am really excited about.\" He also visited St. James&rsquo; Hospital today, where he met many first- and second- year students, about whom he said: &ldquo;It was great to have so many students there so receptive to the ideas I have for the Communications Office, including the introduction of a Health Sciences correspondent for UT.\"\r\n\r\nMoloney also reported a positive third day of campaigning. He mentioned that the voters&rsquo; poll conducted by &lsquo;Trinity News&rsquo; was for him &ldquo;the important part of the day&rdquo;, adding that: &ldquo;this shows that video-based campaigning works. Clearly people are reacting well to it.\"\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #8f1163;\"><strong>Welfare:</strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0066.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-23744 aligncenter\" alt=\"DSC_0066\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0066.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" /></a></p>\n<strong>Charlotte Ryan &amp; Fiona Gribben\u00a0</strong>| Staff Writers\r\n\r\nIt was another busy day for Dan McFadden who attended the Sochi Winter Olympics Protest outside the Russian Embassy in Rathgar in support of LGBTQ rights in Russia. Dan said \"It is vital that we stand in solidarity with the LGBT community in Russia and I was very proud to have taken part in the protest along with members of my team\".\r\n\r\nDan and Kevin, the Welfare Bear, were in D'Olier St, in the nursing building campaigning around midday while his team were highly visible in the arts block that afternoon, yellow t-shirts appearing to outnumber campaigners for the other candidates. Today Dan and his campaign team focused on handing out Welfare Cards which give a list of the relevant welfare services and contacts for Trinity Students.\r\n\r\nIan Mooney had an equally hectic day describing his team as being &ldquo;in fantastically high form and their enthusiasm was overwhelming to be honest.&rdquo; Ian started off the day with a couple of lecture addresses before also heading off to the Russian Embassy relating how the protest had a &ldquo;good atmosphere all round!&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon Ian and his team did some campaigning in the Arts Block and Hamilton before going over to D'Olier Street to speak to 3rd year Nursing students who were &ldquo;incredible nice and welcoming as expected.&rdquo; Ian has received &ldquo;a good boost to the self esteem&rdquo; in a recent poll by Trinity News which put him ahead of Dan, however he is &ldquo;not getting cocky about anything and taking it all with a pinch of salt.&rdquo;\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #8f1163;\"><strong>Education:</strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0175.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-23748 aligncenter\" alt=\"DSC_0175\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0175.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" /></a></p>\n<strong>Sarah Ledden\u00a0</strong>| Staff Writer\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Campus was noticeably quieter on the third day of campaigns. Perhaps exhaustion from two hustings yesterday has taken its toll, but it may also be that the candidates have ventured off campus to campaign.</p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Katie Byrne said that \"today was really busy but went well\". She attended the Russian Embassy student protest against the discrimination of the LGBT community at the Sochi Winter Olympics this morning; commenting on the event, she told\u00a0<em>The University Times\u00a0</em>that \"O</span>ur LGBTRO, Stephen Hatton, spoke particulary well and also Max the representative from LGBT Noise.\"<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">\n</span>\r\n\r\nAfterwards she had an interview with Trinity FM, which she described as \"really enjoyable\". She added that \"I'd love to say a big thanks to everyone at TFM for the invite.\"\r\n<div>Byrne also visited D&rsquo;Olier Street and St. James&rsquo; hospital to meet students after the Russian Embassy protest where she felt she was positively received. \"All in all in all a very busy but really successful day.\"</div>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Speaking about her campaign so far she said she is &ldquo;really happy&rdquo; with it and that there is a &ldquo;great atmosphere among all the candidates&rdquo;.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Katie will no doubt be scanning the focl\u00f3ir tonight in preparation for tomorrow&rsquo;s Cumann Gaelach Toghch\u00e1na\u00edocht.</span>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #8f1163;\"><strong>Ents:</strong></span></h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0075.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-23745 aligncenter\" alt=\"DSC_0075\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0075.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" /></a></p>\n<strong>Patrick Lavelle\u00a0</strong>| Staff Writer\r\n\r\nDay Three in the Ents Race got off to a quieter start than previous days, with a smaller number of campaigners around campus. Finn began campaigning at 9am, while Alex was present in the Arts Block from early morning. Ben, on the other hand, spent the morning off campus organising his event tonight; however his campaign team could be seen around campus.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Finn was the only Ents candidate to attend the Sochi protest outside the Russian embassy. Finn told <em>The University Times</em> that the event was important for empowering LGBTQ students, however repeating his comment from last nights Q Soc Hustings, he felt that other methods could have been more successful in having a significant impact.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Both Alex and Ben&rsquo;s web presence were down today, as a punishment from the Electoral Commission (EC). Alex told UT that hers was taken down after Cancer Soc invited their followers to Alex&rsquo;s event next week, unknowingly breaking EC rules. Her web presence will be back up after midnight.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Ben received a tougher penalty, with his web presence down until Friday. Speaking to UT, Ben stated that his punishment was due to his team posting a video online a day before campaigning began, breaking EC rules against pre-campaigning.\u00a0 Ben firmly denied allegations that he had in fact been punished for paying a website to get 300 likes for his Facebook page. However, a source close to the EC told <em>The University Times</em> that Ben was taken offline for posting two videos without approval, launching an event giving gifts without approval, and undeclared expenses.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">The main event of the day will be Ben and Finn&rsquo;s events tonight, in the Palace and the Village respectively. The events are sure to be an interesting indication of support for both campaigns. Ticket&rsquo;s for Alex&rsquo;s event next week, a Masquerade Boat Party on the MV Cill Airne, will go on sale tomorrow for &euro;15, with all profits going to Cancer Soc.</span>\n<em>Updated at 21:21 5/1/2014 to include quote from EC source</em>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DSC_0232.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23706", "Heading": "Leadership Race 2014: Day Three"}
