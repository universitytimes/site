The motion, titled 'female\u00a0participation\u00a0 sought to mandate the USI Equality officer to run a campaign highlighting the 'persistent inequalities between men and women in Irish society' and to work with other organisations who 'share (our) vision for an equal society'. A number of student delegates spoke for and against the motion, with those in opposition arguing that the motion was 'offensive' and 'insulting' to women.\n\nA number of delegates also referenced the fact that seven of the nine full time offices of USI are currently occupied by women as indication that the motion was unnecessary.\n\nA second motion, proposed by Saint Angela's College Students' Union, sought to realise greater female participation within the student movement, arguing that such a move would lead to the perception of USI as a 'more inclusive structure'. In a repeat of many of the arguments made during the earlier debate, a number of delegates spoke of the 'discriminatory' nature of the motion, with a general sentiment suggesting the impetus to seek public office was the responsibility of the individual and USI should not actively seek to promote greater female participation within its structures. One delegate stated that 'no one needs to be segregated by USI' while another argued that candidates for public office should be elected on merit and women did not need to be encouraged to seek nominations.\n\nIn an open floor vote, both motions were defeated. USI has not yet released the official vote tally.\n\nSpeaking to this reporter, SU Welfare officer Aisling N\u00ed Chonaire labeled the decisions 'incredibly disappointing' and 'regressive'. She went on to comment that it was 'important to realise that these motions were concerned with the 'fundamental societal and structural barriers, as found in evidence-based research such as 'Women's Participation in Politics (Joint Committee on Justice, Equality Defence &amp; Women's Rights, 2009) that women face on a daily basis. This is seen clearly in our own students' union, with 60% of our total population comprising of women, but women remain grossly underrepresented in the corridors of influence and power.\n\nA third motion titled 'Impact of austerity measures' argued that women had been disproportionately burdened with austerity in recent budgets. The motion sought to mandate USI officers to highlight how women have been more affected by austerity measures and to lobby for a more 'equal balance' in the implementation of future austerity. A procedural motion from IT Tralee SU not to hold the vote was passed by a majority of delegates\n\nNational Congress is the highest decision-making body of USI. The four day event is running this week in Co. Galway with over 250 delegates from USI's 44 affiliated institutions in attendance. Each institution commands one vote per every thousand members plus one mandatory vote with the TCDSU delegation consisting of eighteen voting students and two observers.\n\n<strong>MOTIONS IN FULL:</strong>\n\nEQ 4\n\n<strong>Women in USI</strong>\n<em>Proposed by: St Angela&rsquo;s College Sligo Students&rsquo; Union</em>\n<strong>Congress notes</strong>\n\nThat there exists policy (09 / EQ9) which recognises that there is an unequal balance of females holding positions at decision making level of Students&rsquo; Unions, particularly sabbatical officer level. This policy mandates for a campaign to be run to promote female involvement at decision making level.\n\n<strong>Congress recognises</strong>\n\nThat within the USI structures there are additional opportunities to be involved in decision making as well as those which occur at National Council.\n\n<strong>Congress further recognises</strong>\n\nThat increased female participation within USI committees, task forces and specially formed working groups will lead to a more equal gender balance.\n\n<strong>Congress believes</strong>\n\nThat a more equal gender balance within these will have an effect of increasing participation of females at sabbatical officer level as they will feel that USI National Council is a more inclusive structure and their opinions will be taken into account in decision making.\n\n<strong>Congress mandates</strong>\n\nUSI Officer Board to actively encourage females to seek nomination for selection to USI Finance Committee, task forces, specially formed working groups and subgroups.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">09 / EQ 9</span>\n<strong>FEMALE PARTICIPATION</strong>\n<strong>Congress notes</strong>\n\nThat there is a long-standing disparity between the number of female members of Students&rsquo; Unions and the number of females holding positions at decision making levels of Students&rsquo; Unions, particularly sabbatical officer level.\n\n<strong>Congress notes</strong>\n\nThat in the final report of the USI Participation Working Group it was noted that statistical evidence indicated that Union members were more likely to vote for a male candidate than a female candidate in cases where at least one of each are present.\n\n<strong>Congress further notes</strong>\n\nThat since the abolition of the Women&rsquo;s Rights Officer there has been little in the way of gender equality campaigns run by USI.\n\n<strong>Congress recognises</strong>\n\nThat the issue of female participation is not one unique to USI. It is an issue which is prevalent in many areas of Irish society.\n\n<strong>Congress further recognises</strong>\n\nThat there are many organisations and government initiatives which are involved in the promotion of gender equality in all aspects of life and some which are specifically involved in increasing female representation at decision making level.\n\n<strong>Congress mandates the Equality Officer</strong>\n\n&bull; To run a campaign highlighting the persistent inequalities between men and women in Irish Society;\n\n&bull; To run a campaign to promote female involvement at decision making level;\n\n&bull; To work with organisations who share our aim of working for an equal society.", "Imageurl": "15505", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15504", "Heading": "USI Congress rejects gender equality motions"}
