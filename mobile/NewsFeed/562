{"Body": "<p>Some Dublin City councillors have recommended that planners refuse permission to Trinity College Dublin for its proposed new student centre.

In a letter to the College&rsquo;s architects, O&rsquo;Donnell and Tuomey, from the Dublin City Council in response to the planning application the Council asks for a number of clarifications relating to draining and flood plans.</p>\n<p>The application asks for permission to redevelop Luce Hall and 183 Pearse St in order to provide for a circa 4,400sqm student facility.
