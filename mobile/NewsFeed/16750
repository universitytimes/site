The debate is still underway as more than 160 amendments are being considered ahead of a vote due to take place at 2am.\n\nIt is thought likely that some changes proposed by Minister of State for European Affairs Lucinda Creighton will be rejected and she will vote against the measure.\n\n<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC_0054.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16758\" alt=\"DSC_0054\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC_0054-1024x678.jpg\" width=\"610\" height=\"403\" /></a>\n\nAccording to Garda officials approximately 200 protestors were in attendance. Tensions were high between pro-choice and pro-life advocates as Garda\u00ed had to step in to keep them separated.\n\n<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC_0035.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-16762\" alt=\"DSC_0035\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC_0035-1024x678.jpg\" width=\"610\" height=\"403\" /></a>\n\nThe Union of Students of Ireland (USI) were also in attendance. They are critical of the general scheme of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill and have called for the implementation of X legislation that \"does as much it can to protect women\".\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/DSC_0064-1024x678.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "16750", "Heading": "TCDSU Attend Pro-Choice Protest"}
