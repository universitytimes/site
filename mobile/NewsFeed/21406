This gave the NO side a margin of 62%, to the margin of 38% for the yes side.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to <em>The University Times</em>, Campaign Manager for the NO side, James Ringland, said that &ldquo;we are delighted that the students of Trinity have decided to back Tom and the amount of work that he has done so far. It is a fantastic night for one of the best men I know and certainly one of the best presidents this college has seen.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n&ldquo;While I am very happy with this result, I have a lot to catch up for to make sure that I am fulfilling my manifesto promises that the students have elected me for,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;I am eager to get back into my role as President and to continue with the hard work that my team and I have been doing so far.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nIn addition, Lenihan wanted like to thank those that supported him during the referendum. &ldquo;I am still humbled by the amount of students that stuck by me. James Ringland, my campaign manager, was outstanding and my friends have been extremely supportive, something that I am forever grateful for.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n<em>Photo by Bernard Ryan</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/TOM.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21406", "Heading": "Referendum to impeach SU President is defeated"}
