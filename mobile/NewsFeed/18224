{"Body": "<strong>Ronan Costello</strong>\n<em>Editor</em>\n\nSenator Norris has handed over the plea letter he wrote on\u00a0behalf\u00a0of his ex-partner Ezra Yizhak who faced charges of statutory rape of a 15 year old boy. The letter was written on Seanad paper and pleads for clemency to be granted in the consideration of Mr Yizhak's case.\n\nDespite these revelations, Senator Norris is determined to stay in the Presidential race. In that past 24 hours, Senator Norris has seen most of senior campaign staff resign. They were followed by more junior staff who had been volunteering for the campaign. Senator Norris admitted to <em>The Sunday Independent</em> that his campaign is now in \"serious trouble\" and that his \"chances are slim\". However, he also said that he was not \"hiding behind shadows. I have to take it on the chin and reassure people all over the country that I'm the same person I was last week\".\n\nMr Norris said that he sent this letter to Mr Yizhak's lawyers and not directly to the High Court judges. On hearing about Mr Yizhak's behaviour, Senator Norris said he was \"appalled\" and that he absolutely maintains that he abhors any abuse of children, whether it is psychological, physical or sexual. He still believes that Mr Yizhak is a \"man of the highest integrity and one in whom I place complete confidence.\" However, he admitted to being \"shattered\" and \"confused\" when the charges were originally made.\n\nSenator Norris said that he did not expect this issue to arise during the campaign. While he anticipated attacks, he had thought that this had happened too long ago to be an issue worth raising again. \"Some people will think it should have cropped up immediately. But I had compartmentalised it away. It was a shocking and painful experience.\"\n\nAs <em>The University Times </em>reported earlier today, <em>The Sunday Independent </em>notes that rumours of these charges and the existence of the letter surfaced on blogs earlier this week. The blogs in question are avowedly pro-Israel.\n\n<strong>Click on photos to enlarge</strong>\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n</span></strong>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage12.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3385\" title=\"Norrisletterpage1\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage12-213x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"213\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3386\" title=\"Norrisletterpage2\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage2-215x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage3.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3387\" title=\"Norrisletterpage3\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage3-220x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"220\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage4.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3388\" title=\"Norrisletterpage4\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage4-226x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"226\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3389\" title=\"Norrisletterpage5\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage5-215x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"215\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage6.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3390\" title=\"Norrisletterpage6\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage6-226x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"226\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage7.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3391\" title=\"Norrisletterpage7\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisletterpage7-210x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisinterviewpage8.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3392\" title=\"Norrisinterviewpage8\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisinterviewpage8-208x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"208\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisinterviewpage9.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3393\" title=\"Norrisinterviewpage9\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Norrisinterviewpage9-219x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"219\" height=\"300\" /></a>", "Imageurl": "3394", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18224", "Heading": "The Norris Letter: Senator isn&#039;t quitting Presidential race"}
