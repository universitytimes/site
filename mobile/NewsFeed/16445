I want to set out the facts of this matter.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I took a note into one of my third years law exams. The note was seen by an invigilator and, as a consequence, I was brought before a disciplinary hearing for breach of the College examination rules. The outcome of that hearing, which I fully accept, is that I must repeat the exam in question.\n<div>\n\nI greatly regret my action and I sincerely apologise to the students and to the College for my behaviour. I have apologised to the Junior Dean and I will fully comply with the sanction imposed on me.\n\nAt this remove, it is not clear to me what I hoped to achieve by taking the note into the exam but I fully accept that any observer could only conclude that I was cheating.\u00a0What I did was wholly wrong and unacceptable. It was also uncharacteristic.\n\n</div>\nSince my election as President of the Students&rsquo; Union last February, I have been experiencing some personal difficulties. I have been diagnosed with depression and, unfortunately, I had neglected my medical treatment which exacerbated my condition. I found myself unable to cope mentally and physically. Getting through the day became a struggle. As the exams loomed closer, I became more stressed. On the morning of the exam in question, I had a panic attack and in a random irrational reaction, I took the note into the exam hall.\u00a0I had suffered several panic attacks throughout the exam period.\n\nNone of this is to excuse my behaviour, for which I take full responsibility, but it does provide context.\n\nImmediately after the incident, I told the current president of the Students&rsquo; Union and my fellow sabbatical officers what had happened. They have offered me their full support and confidence, for which I am deeply grateful. I will do all I can in the fulfilment of my role over the next year to reward their trust.\"", "Imageurl": "16449", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "16445", "Heading": "Statement from Tom Lenihan regarding College disciplinary proceedings"}
