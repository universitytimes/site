{"Body": "<strong>Niall Donnelly</strong>\n<em>College Affairs Editor</em>\n\nThe number of Senior Freshman (SF) Science students having to sit supplmental modules\u00a0 is significanty high, promting fears that poor exam scheduling is to blame. Figures illustrate the depth of the problem, 120 students had to resit science modules during the September repeats and that does not include the number of students who passed by compensation, choosing not to repeat failed moduels. The average number of modules a SF student had to re-sit was at a high of 3.6.\n\nThese figures were brought to the attention of <em>The University Times</em> after a Katie Boyle SF Science Convenor highlighted her concerns to SU\u00a0 Education Officer Rachel Barry. Boyle suggested that a hectic exam timetable was to blame for the high level of repeats.\n\nShe explained that she had to sit fifteen exams in the May exam period; three of them were practical and the remaining twelve were written exams. Six of the written exams were scheduled for the first five days of the examination period.\n\nShe further explained that students tended to select certain combinations of subjects but that these were more likely to be examined in quick sucession. For example, four Geology modules were scheduled for the start of the examination period but on top of this were core Biology modules that most students are expected to sit. This could have been avoided by spacing these core modules throughout the examination period, giving students preparation time for each exam. To try and overcome the timetabling nightmare, students are trying to develop tactics to save time. Many try to spot patterns of exam questions, proritised in some subjects and modules, over others.\n\nRachel Barry met with the Science Department&rsquo;s Course Director, Prof Watson, to discuss the students concerns. Barry and Watson agreed that the high level of failure was a multi faceted issue. The figures could be due to a varity of reasons. She explained, &ldquo;There is the obvious issue that there are some students who are simply not doing the required level of work&rdquo;. Secondly, and more intriguing, it was suggested that, &ldquo;Many students are not prepared by the leaving cert for the type of learning expected by college&rdquo;. The SU has promised to look into this issue in the forthcoming months. Finally, the competitive nature of the moderatorship system was noted. Barry stated, &ldquo;If a student wants to get a moderatorship in, say, Plant Sciences in JS year they tend to put more emphasis on their Biology modules, sometimes to the neglect of other modules. They then get into a situation where they actually fail the other modules!&rdquo;\n\nHowever Barry took issue with the problem of exam timetabling, suggesting that it was being overlooked by the Science Department. She noted, &ldquo;the sheer amount of exams being sat by science students, and the timetabling of those exams, results in an extremely tough annual examination period&rdquo;. Although reaffirming that it was not the only factor she suggested, &ldquo;It is quite clear that the amount of exams being sat in one period (which can be higher than 10 in some departments) may have an effect on the mental health of students around the exam period and consequently their ability to pass all of their exams&rdquo;\n\nShe concluded that the matter merited further discussion and informed us that she has produced a comprehensive report on the current academic year structure which will be tabled at the Undergraduate Studies Committee and circulated throughout college.\n\nClive Williams, Head of the Electioneering, Mathematics and Science Faulty, spoke to <em>The University Times</em> about the issue. He expressed his concerns over the increase of students failing science, explaining that there was a 5% increase in the failure rate from last year, from 33.5% to 38.5%. He highlighted that although the figures were a cause for concern, it was tricky to see trends in the data to conclude that students who had more stressful timetables failed more exams. Nevertheless he believed that having numerous exams clustered together was unfair. Williams had a meeting with the Science Course Committee last week to resolve the timetabling problem. The Committee agreed to have a closer look at the issue and would attempt to spread out the examinations for next year timetable.", "Imageurl": "4489", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4488", "Heading": "SF Science students repeat an average of 3.6 exams"}
