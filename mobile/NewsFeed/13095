{"Body": "<strong>Una Kelly</strong>\n<em>Online News Editor</em>\n\nA new approach to learning languages has emerged in Dublin. Every Monday evening at 6.30pm in Dtwo on Harcourt Street people from all over the world gather to improve their foreign language skills.\n\nLanguage Exchange Ireland, set up in March this year, organise and facilitate language exchanges, with the aim of helping people learn and improve on their Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian and English in a relaxed environment. Attendance at each meeting is around fifty people, with numbers steadily rising. The exchanges are structured so that people may practice with native speakers of the language they are learning. &ldquo;Unfortunately most language schools, including major universities and expensive English schools, do not put enough emphasis on oral and conversational aspects of languages, which at the end of the day is the most important. Having a language is no good unless you can speak it,&rdquo; says Oliver McCormack, one of the organisers. &ldquo;The exchanges set up by Language Exchange Ireland are rectifying this problem.&rdquo;\n\nOn arrival, participants are assigned a table opposite a native speaker of the language they are learning. They speak English for five minutes, then the other language for the next five minutes before moving on to the next table to speak to a new person. There is a &euro;5 charge for the event, which includes food provided during the break. Dtwo have reduced their drinks prices during the event to &euro;3 for pints and bottles.\n\n&ldquo;These exchanges are a great way to improve your language skills in an organised and easy going manner,&rdquo; notes McCormack. &ldquo;As the trend for people learning languages in Dublin continues to grow, events like this are sure to grow as people do not have to make any commitments or pay lump sums for classes. Instead they can come along when they feel like it and learn from native speakers who also want to learn languages.&rdquo;\n\nThe exchanges cater for all levels, from beginner to fluent.
