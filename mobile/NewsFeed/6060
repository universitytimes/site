Professor John Boland has been presented with the ACSIN Nanoscience Prize for his contribution to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology.\n\nHe was presented the award at the ACSIN-11 conference in St.Petersburg, Russia, on October 6<sup>th</sup>.\n\nAlong with being Professor of Chemistry in Trinity College, Professor Boland leads Ireland&rsquo;s premiere nanoscience institute, CRANN. The institute is host to a team of over 160 distinguished researchers, ranging from over thirty different countries. The Professor was named Laureate of the award for his outstanding work in the development and application of scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy and in the use of these tools to advance our understanding of chemical and physical phenomena of materials.\n\nThe ACSIN Nanoscience Prize is an eminent award in the field of nanoscience. Awarded every two years, previous Laureates have included the Nobel-Prize in Physics winner Albert Fert, who won the award in 2005.\n\nProfessor Boland has a distinguished academic career. Receiving a BSc degree from UCD in Chemistry, he continued his studies in the United States, earning a PhD from the California Institute of Technology, where he was an IBM graduate fellow. From 1984 to 1994 he was a researcher at the IBM T.J Watson Research Centre, and joined the chemistry faculty at the University\nof North Carolina in 1994. He moved to the School of Chemistry in Trinity College in 2002.\n\nOn receipt of the award in St. Petersburg, Professor Boland wished to thank those whom he has worked with during his research,\nincluding his past students. He also stated that he was &ldquo;particularly proud to represent Ireland&rdquo; and believed that the award would help demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s developments &ldquo;not only in nanoscience but in all areas of science and technology&rdquo;.\n\nNanoscience is playing an increasingly fundamental role in the Irish economy. With nanotechnology estimated to have a global market value of $3trn by 2015, Ireland has become increasingly influential in the sector. Over 120,000 jobs are linked to\u00a0 anoscience and nanotechnology, contributing to 10% of the nation&rsquo;s national exports, over &euro;15bn. It also plays a seminal role in Ireland&rsquo;s three largest industries; pharmaceuticals, medical devices and ICT. With international accolades being awarded to people such as Professor Boland, the progress of the industry in this country is hoped to continue.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "6064", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6060", "Heading": "Trinity Professor awarded international academic prize"}
