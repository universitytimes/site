{"Body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Trinity College will be releasing a report on Semesterisation and its effect on students&rsquo; exam results this year next month, according to the college&rsquo;s Communications Office.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Last year was the first year in which all Trinity students were required to familiarize themselves with the new semesterised terms. Semesterisation was introduced to organise the academic year into two terms, with each term containing different modules and assessment for each term. This replaced the traditional structure which consisted of three terms; namely Michaelmas, Hilary and Trinity. The Trinity term is now a non-teaching term which runs from April to early July and incorporates a pre-exam study period and the exam period itself.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Introduction of the semesterised terms can into effect almost immediately after the government, through the HEA, threatened the college with &ldquo;massive budget cuts&rdquo; if they failed to put in place the new two-term system.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">However, many students had to adjust to a heavy workload and an intensely crammed examination timetable due to the unbalanced structure of assessment in each course. Exams taking place during Reading Weeks became a major concern as students did not have sufficient time to catch up on course work. This issue was discussed by the Students&rsquo; Union at the last Undergraduate Studies Committee which took place on the 21st of April.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Courses with large numbers such as Medicine and BESS had to tackle the worst summer examinations timetable as certain students&rsquo; had to cope with the pressure of sitting five exams spaced between five days and many faults with the distribution of the papers. The director of BESS, Prof. Francis O&rsquo; Toole sent an email to JS BESS last year giving them an early warning that the exam timetable may not work in their favour and to be prepared for consecutive exams.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Students studying these subjects were also the first to sit the exams due to the volume of corrections that were necessary for these courses.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Despite the various complaints that students have made about this &ldquo;halfway house&rdquo; system and the many problems incurred, it is yet to be seen whether grades have been affected, or whether a policy of &ldquo;soft marking&rdquo; and grade inflation was employed during the marking of the papers this year.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">The recent release of league table results also present difficulties as regards exam results. The QS World University Rankings show Trinity has dropped. It held the position of 43rd for the past two years, but this year took a dive outside the top fifty to 52nd. This fall in the QS rankings, widely considered to be the most important tables, will no doubt put pressure on Trinity to improve these rankings in the future.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Student exam results play a role, though not a wholly decisive one, in determining where in the league table a university lies. Given the negative backlash from the student body with regard to last year&rsquo;s changes, it would be plausible to suggest that lecturers may have been inclined to mark papers more generously, in order to save face and show that the transition to semesterisation has had little to no effect on the ability of Trinity students to perform well in exams.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">A recent investigation into grade inflation has also caused concern amongst the Presidents of Irish Universities as it called into question the quality of the degrees awarded to students. The Irish Universities Association claimed that the data in an internal TCD study on &ldquo;soft marking&rdquo; was overstated and misrepresented the level of increase on students&rsquo; grades.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Speculations that soft marking was exercised this year due to high stress levels amongst students still continue as figures such as 100% pass rate in Junior Freshman English Studies emerge.&nbsp; Although college officials claim that the higher proportion of students passing summer exams is due to factors such as the use of advanced information technology, an increase in mature students, semesterisation and a greater interest in higher education throughout the population.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Claims of grade inflation can further be disputed by the fact that external examiners are appointed to mark all exam papers in JS and SS cycles, to ensure that all papers are marked in a fair and equitable way that is based upon the curriculum taught in each course.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Evidence of such a process at work was noted by the Irish Independent on June 19th, which it reported how exam results from Trinity&rsquo;s School of Education, which is linked to the Educational Colleges of Marino and Frobel, were delayed because the external examiner had found discrepancies within the papers.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">With the difficulties that came to light last year with TCD&rsquo;s new semeseterised terms, legitimacy of students&rsquo; grades will be called into question with the release of the report next month along with the new system itself. College officials deny that the release of the report will have any indication as to whether semesterisation last year had a negative effect on students&rsquo; performance.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Trinity College will be releasing a report on Semesterisation and its effect on students&rsquo; exam results this year next month, according to the college&rsquo;s Communications Office.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">Last year was the first year in which all Trinity students were required to familiarize themselves with the new semesterised terms.
