{"Body": "<p>Trinity College students and staff are sure to be affected by the recently proposed public sector pay cuts. Public sector unions have agreed to a nationwide 24-hour strike on Tuesday, November 24th.</p>\n<p>The unions discussed plans for the strike following talks with the Department of Finance on how to achieve &euro;1.3 billion in cuts in the public sector pay bill. On Friday night last it emerged the Government will save about &euro;300 million in a full year arising from the moratorium on recruitment in the public service and initiatives such as the incentivised early retirement and career break schemes aimed at reducing the numbers on the State&rsquo;s payroll.</p>\n<p>The Government&rsquo;s side in the talks has insisted that such savings cannot be taken into account in relation to the &euro;1.3 billion reduction in the public sector pay bill it is seeking for 2010. Trade unions have said there was a need for the Government &ldquo;to put up in lights&rdquo; the amount already contributed by public servants through pension levy, pay rises foregone and operating with fewer staff as a result of the moratorium.</p>\n<p>College&rsquo;s Communications Officer stated; &ldquo;Should the proposed strike action proceed on November 24, College will have in place procedures to maintain essential services and to respond to any emergencies that may occur during the course of the strike. Once the details of the proposed action become known Heads and Managers in each area will give due consideration to the number of staff available for duty in order to ensure that appropriate levels of supervision are in place throughout faculties, departments and laboratories to adequately protect the health and safety of students and others on campus.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>However if the college security do decide to go on strike they will have to have skeleton staff in place, which would entail having the bare minimum members of security working. This is in keeping with college safety regulations. It is unsure yet as to whether teaching will stop on the day, if not then students will be faced with the decision of whether or not to pass the picket line.</p>\n<p>Students&rsquo; Union President C&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Broin stated that; &ldquo;the Students&rsquo; Union does not have a stance on the merits or demerits of the strike. We are simply trying to protect students&rsquo; interests.&rdquo; The Irish Federation of University Teachers&rsquo; (IFUT) Executive has not yet had a chance to decide on their response as the proposal to have a national stoppage was only made to them on Wednesday last.<br />Today however the unions who are proposing the strike will meet to work out the details of what exactly they will be doing on the day. It is expected to be announced this evening. If the strike action goes ahead as planned, the department of Finance will send out notices to unions stating that workers will not be paid for &ldquo;unauthorised absence&rdquo;. If even a fraction of the 320,000 public sector workforce went on strike, the Government could end up saving millions in pay costs. The total bill for the public sector is currently &euro;20bn per annum and is being scrutinised by the Government for further cutbacks following last year&rsquo;s pension levy.</p>\n<p>Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan had this to say, &ldquo;The simple, stark reality is that we don&rsquo;t have the funds to fund what the public service unions expect. And they are going to have to address that reality with us. If they choose to deny that reality, if they choose to embark on industrial action, for example, all that will happen is further damage to the economy and the people of this country.&rdquo;</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>Trinity College students and staff are sure to be affected by the recently proposed public sector pay cuts.
