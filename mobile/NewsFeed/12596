After the usual introduction, a motion was proposed to be discussed regarding on whether or not the house '[regretted] the actions of both the auditor and the treasurer'.\n\nIt was revealed yesterday that Engle, a US citizen, had taken a &euro;2,000 loan from the society in the summer in order to meet minimum balance requirements to hold a visa and cover the cost of rent for the summer. The loan was authorised by the society treasurer under the assumption of later committee ratification that was never achieved.\n\nNumerous speakers went up to speak both in support of the motion and against it. Some of the arguments in support of the motion involved accusations of a breach of trust, damage to the reputation of the society, abuse of power and the general secrecy involved in the transaction. One speaker even went as far as to call Engle&rsquo;s actions &lsquo;despicable&rsquo;. Another point that was brought up was that there was no guarantee that Engle would pay the money in question back.\n\nOthers were more sympathetic to the auditor &ndash; many mentioned his positive qualities, which included outstanding commitment and dedication to the society. One speaker jokingly stated that there could have been a graver misuse of funds, and that this small transgression was not the worst that could happen. Others also mentioned the extraordinary circumstances in which John was involved &ndash; the short notice of threat of deportation, difficulty in receiving a bank loan in that time period, and the awkwardness involved in renewing a visa, for instance.\n\nAnother point that was brought up by speakers was the fact that these kinds of actions needed to be stopped in the future. The notion of a failed system that needed to be replaced by a more robust one was also clearly heard throughout the debate.\n\nThe debate was concluded by a moving speech from Engle himself and by a speech from the president of the Historical society. Engle once again explained the complicated matters surrounding the urgency of the loan, and the fact that he approached the students' union welfare officer with no results in a very emotional address to the society.\n\nThe president continued by applauding members for their ability to speak on sensitive, real-life problems wit h respect to those involved, and stressed the need for the society to remain independent in terms of its choice on how to deal with the matter.\n\nSpeaking to <em>The University Times</em>, the society treasurer offered the following brief statement:\n\n'I authorised the loan with the implication that it was to be cleared by committee, and was subsequently hospitalised for surgery thereafter so was unaware committee was not informed.'\n\nThe debate concluded with the Hist setting up a sub-committee in order to investigate the matter further.", "Imageurl": "12600", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12596", "Heading": "Hist members debate motion to 'regret' auditor loan"}
