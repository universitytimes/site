In addition, the whole BLU complex will open on a 24-hour basis three weeks before exams commence.[/caption]\n\n<strong>Owen Bennett</strong> | Editor\n\nAn agreement has been reached between College, the Students' Union and the Graduate Students' Union whereby parts of the library will open on a 24-hour basis in the weeks preceding and the weeks of final and supplemental exams. The agreement comes after several months of negotiations between representatives from the office of the Vice-Provost for Academic Affairs and the students' unions.\n\nFrom March 4<span style=\"font-size: 11px;\">th</span>, the Berkeley library will open on a 24-hour basis and such arrangements will remain in place until May 10<sup>th</sup>. \u00a0In addition to this, from April 8<sup>th</sup>, the complete BLU complex, encompassing the Berkeley, Lecky and Ussher libraries, will be open on a 24-hour basis.\n\nThe same arrangements for the Berkeley library will be implemented for a five week period during late August and September to facilitate students sitting supplemental exams and postgraduate students preparing for dissertation and theses deadlines.\n\nSpeaking to <em>The University Times</em>, SU Education officer Dan Ferrick said 'this is a major step in the right direction in terms of the services students expect and need from Trinity. There is still more to do regarding library facilities but this should go some way toward taking some of the exam pressure off students.\n\nGraduate Students' Union President Martin McAndrew welcomed the new arrangements to assist postgrads, commenting that the new library opening hours will 'result in fewer postgraduates trying to secure Dean's Grace (an extension to theses deadlines) and will help ease the pressure-cooker atmosphere in the 1937 Reading Room where demand for space far outstrips supply.\n\nOver summer, renovations to the Ussher tower are expected to take place to facilitate a further extension of the 24-hour opening hour arrangements in the coming years.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Additional reporting by Jack Leahy</em>\n<em>For further updates and analysis on this story, see issue five of The University Times, on campus next Tuesday.\u00a0</em>", "Imageurl": "14305", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14303", "Heading": "Exam Period to See 24-Hour Berkeley Library "}
