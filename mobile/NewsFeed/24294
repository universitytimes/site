This follows an earlier announcement that <i>2ManyDJs</i>, <i>Duke Dumont</i>, and <i>Le Galaxie</i> will be playing.\r\n\r\nExample shot to fame in 2007 with his album <i>What We Made</i>, and his latest album, confirmed for release later this year, is hotly anticipated. <i>Ben Pearce</i>, who also played the Freshers' Ball alongside another confirmed act, <i>Le Galaxie</i>, is well-known on the deep house circuit. English electro act <i>Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs</i> will bring a more mainstream electronic dance sound to the ball. Lauded by BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac and Nick Grimshaw, he headlined the debut three-day Longitude festival in Marlay Park in Dublin last year to great critical acclaim.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24296\" alt=\"example\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/example.jpg\" width=\"620\" height=\"427\" />\n<i>Miles Kane</i>, best known for playing alongside Arctic Monkey's frontman Alex Turner in the supergroup <i>Last Shadow Puppets</i> and formerly a member of <i>The Rascals</i>, will also be a prominent member of the line-up.\r\n\r\nScottish singer-songwriter <i>Nina Nesbitt</i>, having recently shot to fame with her debut album <i>Peroxide</i>, will draw a similar crowd to last year's choice of <i>Ellie Goulding</i> as an up-and-coming indie pop act. And following in the footsteps of last year's BBC Sound of 2013 nominees and Trinity Ball acts <i>Aluna George</i> and <i>Tom Odell</i>, <i>Chl\u00f6e Howl</i>, nominated for the 2014 award, will feature in this year's line-up. In a similar vein,<i> Laura Welsh</i> will feature as one of the smaller singer-songwriter acts.\r\n\r\nFans of drum and bass will be excited to hear the inclusion of London DJ <i>Wilkinson</i> to the line-up, who is touring after his hugely successful debut album, <i>Lazers Not Included</i>.\r\n\r\nOne of Ireland's favourite acoustic hip-hop acts, <i>The Original Rudeboys</i>, will also be featuring. Nottingham-based indie solo act <i>Saint Raymond</i> will feature as one of the more relaxed-sounding acts at the ball. Heavily influenced by <i>The Sex Pistols</i>, London-based alternative rock bands <i>The Godfathers</i> and <i>The Sussed</i> will bring a more mature punk-rock sound to the night.\r\n\r\n<strong>Correction: February 17, 2014\u00a0</strong>\n<em>This article originally stated that\u00a0The Sussed performed on the Salty Dog stage at Electric Picnic last year. In fact, their performance at Trinity Ball 2014 will be their first performance in thirty years. They will perform at Electric Picnic later this year.</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/trinityball.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24294", "Heading": "Full Trinity Ball Line-up Announced"}
