They will be\u00a0working on-site at the NCRC in the hospital to ensure close collaboration with the centre&rsquo;s paediatric\u00a0scientists.\r\n\r\nThe move comes as the two centres establish the Paediatric Research in Translational\u00a0Immunology (PRiTI) Programme. The programme is dedicated to the study of immunologic\u00a0mechanisms of disease in children, and will contribute to the development of more targeted forms\u00a0of treatment for common children&rsquo;s inflammatory diseases such as asthma, eczema and infant\u00a0sepsis.\r\n\r\nProfessor Paul Browne, Interim Head of the TCD School of Medicine, said that the\u00a0introduction of the Assistant Professorships &ldquo;will ensure our immunologists are in proximity\u00a0to children with inflammatory conditions. These translational research environs will make real\u00a0discoveries that will improve the health of children.&rdquo; He also commented that the programme&rsquo;s\u00a0&ldquo;ethos of bench-bedside paediatric research will be relevant to the new National Children&rsquo;s Hospital\u00a0at St James&rsquo;s Hospital.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Carlos Blanco, director of the NCRC, stated: &ldquo;The National Children&rsquo;s Research\u00a0Centre and the Children&rsquo;s Medical Research Foundation are committed to funding and facilitating\u00a0the development of paediatric research in Ireland.&rdquo; He also spoke of the centre&rsquo;s aspirations to\u00a0become a &ldquo;nationally and internationally recognised centre for the quality of its research, its\u00a0contribution to advances in paediatric medicine and a driver of the research agenda in paediatrics.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nThe programme is led by two TCD School of Medicine professors: the Director of the\u00a0programme is Professor Padraic Fallon, Stokes Professor of Translational Immunology, with\u00a0Professor Alan Irvine, Professor of Dermatology, as co-Director.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Paediatric-Research-in-Translational-Immunology-PRiTI-Programme.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21229", "Heading": "School of Medicine Joins Paediatric Research Programme, Helps Provide &euro;1.7m in Funding"}
