{"Body": "<strong>Vladimir Rakhmanin</strong> | <em>Deputy Editor\u00a0</em>\r\n\r\nIn a meeting that took place at 11:00 am today, the heads of Dublin University Central Athletic Club (DUCAC), the Central Societies Committee (CSC), Trinity College Students&rsquo; Union (TCDSU), the Graduate Students&rsquo; Union (GSU), and Trinity Publications strongly opposed the College&rsquo;s decision to make cuts to Trinity&rsquo;s capitated bodies.\r\n\r\nTom Lenihan, SU President, stated that &lsquo;the capitations committee rejects the process by which the cuts were arrived at&rsquo;, as there were issues with &lsquo;legitimacy&rsquo; and &lsquo;transparency&rsquo;. Lenihan then said the the next step would be to &lsquo;formulate a coherent proposal from the capitations committee&rsquo;, with &lsquo;input from every capitated body&rsquo;.\r\n\r\nThe e-mail announcing the cuts was sent on the 21<sup>st</sup> of November to all capitated bodies. It was sent by Moray McGowan, Senior Dean. When asked about the college&rsquo;s decision to make the cuts, McGowan replied that he was unable to respond as he was not a member of the Planning Group and Board.\r\n\r\nThere is a 5% reduction to all capitated bodies in Trinity, with an overall &euro;60,000 reduction to funds distributed. The reduction is &ldquo;not explicitly mentioned&rdquo; in the minutes from the Board meeting last June; it forms a part of Planning Group Report Number 9, which is not reproduced in the minutes.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/centreforcontemporarymodernhist_large.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22345", "Heading": "Trinity's Capitated Bodies Oppose Cuts"}
