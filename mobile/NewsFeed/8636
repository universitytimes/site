{"Body": "<strong>Sarah O'Neill</strong>\n<em>Staff Writer</em>\n\nSuas Trinity are taking to Grafton Street this Wednesday the 22<sup>nd</sup>\u00a0to raise much needed funds for under-resourced schools in Ireland, India and Kenya. Suas is an education-focused social change organisation that supports programmes in Ireland, India &amp; Kenya.\n\nEvery year, Suas sends volunteers, of which over half are generally Trinity students or alumni, to our Indian and Kenyan partners for a 10 week long volunteer programme. This placement is one part of a year round partnership involving consistent financial and technical support. Unfortunately, due to recent unrest Suas made the difficult decision not to send volunteers to Kenya this summer.\n\nIn such turbulent times the partner organisations really rely on Suas and the consistent support the NGO provides.\n\nWe also run several mentoring projects here in Ireland which all operate on a weekly basis. Suas is a registered charity that identifies education as integral to social transformation. All our mentoring projects aim to address the deficit in literacy levels in under-resourced schools while developing leadership and teamwork skills above and beyond curriculum guidelines.\n\nWe&rsquo;re looking for volunteers to shake some buckets this Wednesday to support the continuation of this vital work. Some of our favourite bands will be busking on the day as well so enjoy the music and don&rsquo;t be afraid to show you&rsquo;re appreciation by throwing them a few quid!\n\nSign up via the doodle form on the Facebook page or in the Arts Block today and you&rsquo;ll be entered into a draw to win a portable DVD player. Don&rsquo;t forget to join us in Kennedys that evening to see some hairy DUHAC lads get waxed for a really good cause.", "Imageurl": "8637", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8636", "Heading": "Suas Day Volunteering"}
