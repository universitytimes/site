Campus reacted almost instantaneously and the comment sections of <em>The University Time</em>s coverage were inundated with heated debate amongst students who had very distinct views on the subject.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many highlighted the inherent elitist and sexist nature of fraternities. They warned of the negative impact an association between Trinity and such organisations could have. Others defended fraternities, claiming they were largely a positive thing &ndash; philanthropic, based in moral values and essentially a harmless social collective. Another section of students, although not as vocal about their views on online forums, declared themselves indifferent and decidedly unaffected by the establishment of a fraternity &ndash; they probably wouldn&rsquo;t join it, but they wouldn&rsquo;t have it closed down either.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A number of themes emerged in the following days &ndash; some named as connected with the society went to great lengths to distance themselves from it; a Facebook group &ndash; &lsquo;No Frat Boys in Trinity&rsquo; was created; CSC and SU representatives spoke out against it &ndash; or at least against any affiliation with the college; rumour and speculation was widespread. As claim and counter-claim flew between commentators, UT journalists and students, a picture of the fraternity&rsquo;s charter emerged, with the names of the fraternity&rsquo;s newest members on it. Photographs of the celebratory chartering dinner soon followed, with a group shot betraying the identities of those involved. Intrigue amongst the student body surged once more as prominent and popular students were identified as initiated members. Many wondered why these seemingly intelligent and affable young men would happily defend their allegiance with a body that was being cast in such a negative light.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What attracted these people to the idea of a fraternity? Whilst rumour and speculation were doing their worst, none of it can be justified without an insider perspective. In an exclusive interview with The University Times Jack Cantillon, Dave Whelan and Cormac McGuinness relived their experience of the fraternity and why they left. Nevertheless, the most important account would come from an existing member. Jack O&rsquo;Connor, president of Theta Omicron, the newest chapter of Zeta Psi, granted permission for an interview on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before talking to O&rsquo;Connor, the UT interviewed those who were involved with the fraternity but had subsequently opted out of being initiated as full members. Cormac McGuinness told the UT he &lsquo;went along with it at the start, as I was curious to see what the fraternity was all about and wanted to make an informed decision about whether or not to be a part of it rather than reject it out of hand&rsquo;. Eventually McGuinness says he began to question some of the fraternity&rsquo;s policies and he ultimately decided it wasn&rsquo;t for him.</p>\n&lsquo;Some of the problems I had with it,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;were the risk of hazing, the exclusivity, the secrecy and the attitude towards women. Once I acknowledged all of this, I knew I wanted nothing to do with the fraternity&rsquo;.\n\nOriginally fearful about upsetting friends in the fraternity, McGuinness eventually decided he couldn&rsquo;t remain a part of the group and was the first to leave. He told Jack of his decision and &lsquo;they were all very understanding about it and didn&rsquo;t give me any hassle&rsquo;.\n\nWhelan and Cantillon are perhaps the most infamous of the former &lsquo;members&rsquo;. Like McGuinness, their involvement was decidedly casual and Cantillon told me he saw it as just &lsquo;a few lads having a few pints&rsquo;. As the group sought to become part of the fraternity body, Cantillon and Whelan both decided to leave.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&lsquo;Jack spoke passionately at a meeting explaining to the lads why we wanted to leave,&rsquo; Whelan told The University Times. &lsquo;I told them I viewed fraternities as elitist, sexist and not something I wanted to be a part of,&rsquo; Cantillon said. &lsquo;To be honest, in hindsight, I probably should have removed myself from the group straight away rather than just being inactive before eventually leaving&rsquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the two were questioned about the Trinity Cancer Society&rsquo;s Naked Calendar photograph, which featured them alongside other fraternity members, Whelan told me he had planned to be in another picture but the Cancer Society told him there had been a change of plan. He knew that others in the shoot were from the fraternity, but didn&rsquo;t see it as a &lsquo;fraternity picture&rsquo;, just a collection of prominent students. Cantillon said he was asked by a Cancer Soc committee member to be in the calendar and agreed &lsquo;seeing no harm as it was just a social group of no consequence&rsquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During the interview with Jack O&rsquo;Connor he confirmed that the photograph had been organised rather haphazardly and that he believed (but can&rsquo;t be sure, as he wasn&rsquo;t president at the time) that the tagline &ndash; &lsquo;all shall soon be revealed&rsquo; &ndash; was in fact added by the Cancer Society.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The thoughts of the former members may shed light on their individual involvement. Despite this, what was at the core of the group as a whole? In an attempt to allow the fraternity to speak for itself, the UT met with and interviewed their president &ndash; Jack O&rsquo;Connor. The interview ensures that O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s words would not be twisted or portray him in a certain way. This is simply a presentation of his opinions to our readers. Some might think him and the fraternity ridiculous; others might find the idea attractive. Either way, it is only fair that he is given the opportunity to win praise or invite ridicule through his own words.</p>\n<h3>What is a fraternity?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is based on the idea of &ldquo;brotherhood&rdquo;, but it is pretty much just making sure that you all look out for each other. As a group you become very close and as an individual you get an incredible amount of value out of it &ndash; you learn leadership skills, make great friends and it&rsquo;s a fantastic networking tool. It also has a fundraising capacity that is taken very seriously.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think a lot of people have watched Old School, or Beta House and have a slightly skewed version of fraternities in mind. As a group, we&rsquo;re a very mixed bunch &ndash; we&rsquo;re not all &lsquo;jocks&rsquo; or all &lsquo;geeks&rsquo;, there is a broad spectrum of people. As for the drinking side, sure we would have a few drinks together socially, but to suggest drinking is at the heart of what we do is simply false. We have pledges who don&rsquo;t drink at all.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What attracted you to fraternities?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last year I was new to college and my course was quite small. I thought of a fraternity as a good way to meet new people, I never really thought of it as something overtly serious. I just thought as a group we&rsquo;d hang out together, maybe wear the same t-shirt occasionally, and have a laugh. All we&rsquo;ve done so far this year is go out together and raise money for cancer soc.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What do you think attracted everyone else?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think the networking aspect attracted a lot of people. The networking opportunities are impressive. I&rsquo;ve got new and very good friends now in America and the UK. I&rsquo;ve got friends in Scotland and Oxford who I could stay with if I was visiting - everyone looks after each other. When I went to visit America in January, I lost my phone and everyone was unbelievably helpful. We wouldn&rsquo;t use the term &lsquo;brotherhood&rsquo; with people here &ndash; they&rsquo;re just &lsquo;the guys&rsquo;, but the bond is a close one.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Were you expecting the reaction that the fraternity received?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There was a time a while ago when we did think about how people would react. People don&rsquo;t like new things. I didn&rsquo;t expect the reaction to be so big or aggressive. We never saw ourselves as &lsquo;we are great&rsquo; or &lsquo;we&rsquo;re better than you&rsquo;. People are saying you need to be rich and good-looking to join &ndash; well, that&rsquo;s just not true &ndash; I&rsquo;m neither! I knew some people would like the idea of fraternities and some wouldn&rsquo;t, but we weren&rsquo;t in the public eye, so it didn&rsquo;t really concern us that much.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why do you think some people left?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When people started saying they wanted to leave because they perceived that some people would see their involvement negatively, I told them I didn&rsquo;t think people would take it too seriously and, well, that didn&rsquo;t turn out to be true &hellip; Some left because they felt their views differed from some of those expressed by the fraternity, it&rsquo;s a simple as that.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Were those names added to the charter because you &lsquo;needed the numbers&rsquo;?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Technically we did need a certain amount of numbers, we had deadlines to meet and so we sent off the names &hellip; there were some members whose involvement was dwindling, but the charter was a provisional thing, you&rsquo;re not a member until you&rsquo;ve been initiated, so I didn&rsquo;t see it as being a serious issue. I added Bennett on the spur of the moment simply because I really wanted him to be a part of it and I thought he wouldn&rsquo;t have a problem with it, but obviously he did and that&rsquo;s fair enough and it was an error on my part.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What does initiation involve? Can you comment on claims that skulls, swords and coffins are involved in the initiation ceremony?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unfortunately there are aspects of the fraternity that I cannot discuss and this is one of them.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What do you say to claims that fraternities are sexist?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I can of course see where people are coming from, because only men can join. But I see it as the same as saying a &lsquo;girls night out&rsquo;, or a &lsquo;lads night in&rsquo; is sexist. Sometimes we feel like spending time with the opposite sex, sometimes we feel like time with the girls, or with the lads. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned, if we&rsquo;re not affiliated with college, it doesn&rsquo;t matter &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a public issue.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have never tried to be recognised by college, not that we don&rsquo;t want to be &ndash; it would be nice &ndash; but we don&rsquo;t need to be. Zeta Psi are fine with us not being affiliated. If the issue of our affiliation arose, I can understand that people don&rsquo;t want college policies misrepresenting them. But I have been approached by six or seven different girls who have asked for help in establishing a sorority, so I don&rsquo;t know if everyone feels the same way.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The way I approached it when the thought first came to mind was &ndash; is it a cult? Is it sacrilegious? That just isn&rsquo;t the case &hellip; it&rsquo;s just hanging out with the lads, looking after each other, having a bit of fun together and raising some money for charity.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What do you say claims that fraternities are elitist?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I can only speak about the values of Zeta Psi &ndash; being respectful and so on &ndash; and I certainly don&rsquo;t see them as representing an elitist body. Members are chosen, essentially, on evidence of them being &lsquo;a good guy&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s not that we&rsquo;re passing judgment, it&rsquo;s pretty much as simple as &lsquo;do I want to be friends with this person?&rsquo; Everyone in our group gets on incredibly well, even though we&rsquo;re a pretty mixed bunch. The suggestion that you have to be &lsquo;financially privileged&rsquo; to join is ridiculous &ndash; our group consists of people from very different financial backgrounds. There is an initiation fee, just to cover costs, but it&rsquo;s very reasonable.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Is it true you received a number of messages from people asking to join the fraternity following recent publicity?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think there were very few who would openly say they wanted to join, but yes, I did get some private requests. I think the people who commented on the articles are the ones who feel very passionately about it either way, but a lot of people joked about it &ndash; I had friends who joked &lsquo;oh, I can&rsquo;t be seen with you anymore&rsquo;. Whilst I think I did get a few strange looks in the days after it all came out, I am yet to have anyone say anything negative to my face. From some of the messages I got it&rsquo;s clear there are those who like the idea.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Would I be correct in saying some have already benefited from the networking aspect of the fraternity?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some have certainly made useful connections already. There is an impressive network of members &ndash; about 80,000 living &ndash; from all manner of disciplines and they are all very happy to be put in touch to see how they can be of help to each other. As the principles underlying all of the chapters are the same, I have found I get on with the crowds in America, Oxford and St. Andrews really well, it turns out we&rsquo;re all very similar people.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Where do you currently stand on affiliation with college?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We aren&rsquo;t affiliated, we have never tried to become affiliated and it is not an issue for us. The fraternity has been very flexible and understanding about the challenges we have faced and are happy with us to function as we are.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Has that allowed you to attract students from other colleges?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whilst all of our initiated members are Trinity students, we do have people interested from other colleges and, as we aren&rsquo;t affiliated with Trinity, we will not refuse them on the grounds that they are not a Trinity student. Decisions on this and other things will be made as planning begins for next year.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What are the plans for next year?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We are looking at renting a house together. It would certainly operate as HQ as we&rsquo;d probably have all of our meetings there but sadly it probably won&rsquo;t be a mansion, playing host to constant parties, as some might imagine. We are going to look into doing bigger and better charity events.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I think we have a unique opportunity to create a positive perception of fraternities in Ireland. We have a luxury in a way of not having other fraternities to compete with, so we can simply concentrate on staying true to our core values. We don&rsquo;t want to impose on anyone&rsquo;s life, we don&rsquo;t want to affect anyone&rsquo;s life negatively. If we have a party, you&rsquo;re all invited. I think we are a pretty relaxed bunch and don&rsquo;t take ourselves too seriously.</p>", "Imageurl": "10231", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10229", "Heading": "Inside Theta Omicron: Interview with Frat President"}
