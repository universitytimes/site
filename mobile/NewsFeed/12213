The strategy aims to build on the University&rsquo;s strong international reputation for research, teaching and innovation in its mission to be a &ldquo;global education hub&rdquo;.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Last year the University appointed a Vice-Provost for Global Relations, Professor Jane Ohlmeyer, to lead this work which has resulted in opening of &lsquo;global gateways&rsquo; in New York, New Delhi and Shanghai. In addition the University is set to make over 30 appointments to successfully implement the strategy and has invested &euro;3 million in the self-financing programme.</p>\nMinister Eamon Gilmore was accompanied by Provost Patrick Pendergast and Professor Jane Ohlmeyer to launch the Global Relations Strategy in the Trinity Long Room Hub. The Provost was first to speak as he highlighted the importance this strategy was to Trinity College and Ireland. Under the new strategy Trinity is to strengthen its brand globally by increasing its international student intake outside of the EU, improve the educational experience by &ldquo;broadening the minds of students&rdquo;, further develop global relationships with other world leading institutions, to build on alumni networks and increase philanthropic income. According to Provost Pendergast, Trinity&rsquo;s global links are part of the Trinity philosophy.\n\nThe Minister spoke more openly about how educational institutions now have more competition than ever. Minister Gilmore was hopeful that a new global trading initiative would help to foster a new demand in Ireland. Furthermore, &euro;1.2 billion could be pushed back into the economy if the steps outlined in the Global Relations Strategy are followed.\n\n&ldquo;Ireland is a small, safe and friendly country,&rdquo; said Minister Gilmore. &ldquo;Our embassy networks are actively engaged with opening doors, supporting alumni and stopping barriers.&rdquo;\n\nProfessor Jane Ohlmeyer was the last of the three to speak. Her speech delved into the financial difficulties for education. In addition, the Global Relations Strategy will have precedence in all aspects of the University.\n\nSpeaking about philanthropic income, Professor Ohlmeyer asked alumni and philanthropists to &ldquo;fund like they&rsquo;ve never funded before&rdquo;.\n\nTrinity is also hopeful that many &ldquo;Trinity diaspora&rdquo; will return next year for The Gathering that will go on throughout 2013. The Gathering is to be launched on New Year&rsquo;s Eve with a festival in Dublin with the hope of bringing some of the 70 million people around the globe who claim Irish ancestry to come home for the festivities.", "Imageurl": "12214", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12213", "Heading": "Gilmore launches TCD Global Relations Strategy"}
