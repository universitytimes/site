The prominent Socialist Party and United Left Alliance politician is calling for a national student strike.\n\n<strong>13:58\u00a0</strong>WSM Twitter account reporting that another twenty members from FEE Galway have now joined the FEE block with a sound-system. No word on the music yet, taking odds on time of first play for Pink Floyd's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4SKL7f9n58\">'Another Brick in the Wall'</a>. FEE block should be about 100 now, though it's not possible to be certain.\n\n<strong>13:54 </strong>David Lynch <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/gribers/status/136802787962003457\">tweets a photo</a> of the student protests.

Confusion surrounding this may be behind lack of clarity on what size that black actually is.\n\n<strong>13:25 </strong>Jack Leahy has been gauging students' temperatures on Ruair\u00ed Quinn at Parnell Square. Cool, it seems. \"Not one of the students we asked had sympathy for his position.\"\n\n<strong>13:23 </strong>UT Editor and TCDSU Communications Officer Ronan Costello has pointed to the 5 lecture days that his union had to raise awareness of the protest as a reason for the low turnout. Trinity's reading week being last week, he said, was also a factor.\n\n<strong>13:20 </strong>Magazine Editor\u00a0Tommy Gavin put the number of FEE protestors closer to a hundred.\n\n<strong>13:17\u00a0</strong>News Editor Leanna Byrne is at Parnell Square and says the numbers are 'way down' on last year. However, march organisers say that they are still waiting on a number of SUs to make an appearance.\n\n<strong>13:10 </strong>UT Editor Ronan Costello is with the Free Education for Everyone (FEE) protest, which is joining the main protest at the Gate Theatre. From what he can see there are about 30 people there, with flags from the Socialist Workers' Party and Eirigi.\n\n<strong>13:07 </strong>Student protest now targetting Minister for Education Ruair\u00ed Quinn with 'keep your pledge' chant.\n\n<strong>13:05\u00a0</strong>Jack Leahy, speaking to student protestors on the march, says that the overwhelming consensus is opposition to upfront fees.\n\n<strong>13:01 </strong>TCDSU have stopped the march at Jim Larkin statue to reorganise.
