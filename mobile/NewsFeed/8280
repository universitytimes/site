{"Body": "<strong>Fionn O'Dea</strong>\n<em>Communications Correspondent</em>\n\nToday saw the first votes of the student elections cast in the unfamiliar surroundings of the Church of Ireland College of Education (CICE), Rathmines. The college canteen was the bizarre setting for candidates' hustings while many of the college's 120 or so students ate their lunch. Rachel Barry, current Education Officer, explained what the format of hustings and polling would be before commenting on the importance of the connection between CICE and Trinity.\n\nFirst to speak of the presidential candidates, Rory Dunne, mentioned that it was a slightly \"weird\" situation to be in before giving a brief synopsis of his manifesto. \"I won't be here (in CICE) every day of the week\" he commented as part of his intention not to make promises that he cannot keep. However, he drew a positive response from the crowd after saying that there has been a failure in student services and that he would like to bring these services to CICE, a sentiment expressed many more times before the end of hustings.\n\nJames Kelly, standing on a table to let himself be seen better, next commented that he wanted to avoid a situation that CICE be \"affiliated with Trinity but never hear from them.\" He claimed that he would like CICE as well as college students in James's and the School of Nursing each to feel more connected to Trinity. He proposed holding SU clinics in CICE twice a semester as well as putting in place a regular contact email.\n\nLast to speak, John Tighe, hoped to keep his speech \"short and sweet\". He spoke of his personal experience with teachers - his father being a teacher and his sister attending St Pat's - and stressed the importance of protecting the \"future educators\" in the crowd. A crowd member noted in a question to the other two candidates that Tighe was the only speaker to address the issue of college fees. While Tighe claimed that he hoped to work with trade unions and the INTO on the matter, Kelly and Dunne emphasised the importance of being realistic with regard to fees.\n\nDan Ferrick claimed that he'd \"love to know all the problems that students in CICE have but that [they] are the ones who know.\" As many candidates did, he proposed solving this by keeping in better contact with CICE. He said that, should he be elected, he would be keen to maintain regular contact with CICE's own SU. He then briefed the students on his manifesto including his hope to extend office hours for one-to-one meetings with students. The end of Ferrick's speech was met with a good response and no questions were asked of him.\n\nThe first welfare candidate to speak, Andy Haughey, was the first to try to make a personal connection with the crowd, something each welfare candidate did, by touting his experience of teaching schoolchildren English in Kenya. \"I know how hard and tiring it can be to keep twenty 12 year old in line\" he assured them. He told them of his plan to bring better student services to them before finishing on his campaign catchphrase of \"I'm there for you\", met with \"awws\" and laughter from the crowd.\n\nFollowing Andy was Aisling Ni Chonaire who claimed to \"see where [CICE students] are coming from\" due to her father being a lecturer in St Pat's for thirty years. She says that she understands that everyone has \"good days and crap days\", especially from talking to friends on teacher placements.\n\nThe announcement of Emma Walker was met with screams from a few friendly faces in the crowd who were heard to shout \"Walker for Welfare\" as her speech drew to a close. She summarised her manifesto's main points and spoke of her experience of working with 150 girls in a school, having to deal with \"bullying, sexual abuse and exclusion.\"\n\nFirst up for communications, Owen 'Cabbage' Bennett said that Communications Officer is perhaps the most important position in the SU from the perspective of CICE students due to their detached nature from Trinity's campus. He claimed that, as CICE students will find it difficult to attend his planned daily clinics in the Arts Block and Hamilton, his proposed online forum would be a convenient way to them to stay in touch and let their problems be known. He also remarked that, considering that it is 2012, it's \"quite silly\" that such forums don't already exist. He noted that CICE has \"less of a society vibe\" than the main Trinity campus and so that his\u00a0<em>Week in Trinity</em>\u00a0videos outlining society news and events could help involve CICE students more. Bennett was not allowed to sit down, however, before he revealed the origin of his nickname. He revealed, to the approval of the crowd, that the nickname comes from his schooldays in Blackrock when his fellow students branded the Mullingar man \"cabbage\" due to his \"cultchie, boggerish accent.\" Kids can be so cruel...\n\nFollowing Bennett was Hannah Cogan who noted that too many people don't understand what the SU does of see its importance, and that this is particularly strong in affiliate colleges. She spoke of rebuilding trust and faith in the SU and of finding ways to get students more involved in policy discussions through monthly town hall meetings.\n\nShe also commented that \"it would be great to get town hall meetings out here (in CICE).\" She spoke of bringing The University Times to CICE, calling it \"appalling\" that its not currently delivered to students at the college and that it does not deal with issues of affiliate colleges. Finally, she said that she would like to extend her planned wrters' workshops to CICE students.\n\nDrawing the communications portion of hustings to a close was James Hagan who admitted that before arriving at the college and speaking briefly to the CICE SU President and Vice-President, he knew little of the the college. Despite this, he said that he wants to know \"what frustrates and gets to CICE students.\"\n\nEchoing what previous candidates had said, he noted that students at the college understand their problems better than outsiders from Trinity. His speech was briefly derailed as his offer of his phone number was met by whooping and laughter from those in attendance. Once the laughs calmed, he explained that texting/phoning is the easiest way to get in contact with the communications officer. The only question from the floor was a student cheekily inquiring if it was his real number. Ah now, he'd hardly give a wrong number to the voters!\n\nLast soeaker of the day, Dave Whelan, first commented on the extremely favourable girl-to-guy ratio in the CICE. He kept his speech short, informing the students of his plans for the Warehouse Project, Pre-drinks FM, as well as \"a fully functioning facebook page where you can buy tickets for events such as the RAG ball.\" Before wrapping up, he revealed plans for a CICE-specific discount card for businesses in the surrounding area.", "Imageurl": "<strong>Fionn O'Dea</strong>\n<em>Communications Correspondent</em>\n\nToday saw the first votes of the student elections cast in the unfamiliar surroundings of the Church of Ireland College of Education (CICE), Rathmines.
