It is up to us students to shape the future of Irish Society.&rdquo;\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hatton said he has no doubt that support for LGBT rights will be indicated by the referendum result. &ldquo;With the rich queer history of Trinity College Dublin, beginning with the Sexual Liberation Movement in 1973, blooming in 1974 into 'The Gay Society', now Trinity's Q Soc - the oldest LGBT Society in Ireland - the students of TCD have played a huge role in campaigning for Queer rights and equality in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0189.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-17662\" alt=\"DSC_0189\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0189-1024x678.jpg\" width=\"610\" height=\"403\" /></a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TCDSU Welfare Officer Stephen Garry, meanwhile, said that the passing of the seemingly inevitable referendum would act as a &ldquo;great message of support to our LGBT students who do not experience the same rights as their heterosexual friends in this country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Garry explained that same-sex marriage is an issue he feels strongly about: &ldquo;With the introduction of our first ever Equality and Diversity Week later this year, as well as various equality initiatives throughout each semester, I want to ensure that every student feels their fundamental human rights are as important as everyone else's. This is the first step towards ensuring that students in Trinity know that they have the support of their union as they strive to be treated equally.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Signature sheets for the potential 'Support for Same-Sex Marriage legislation in Ireland' \u00a0referendum are available from SU Offices in House 6; positions to run campaigns for/against the referendum will be advertised should the necessary signatures be collected.</p>\nFollowing on from last year&rsquo;s preferendum, meanwhile, the SU will hold an abortion referendum alongside Sabbatical elections later in the year as mandated by SU council last year.\n\n<em>Pictured: TCDSU Exec and Q-Soc.</em>", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC_0179.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "17634", "Heading": "TCDSU to hold Marriage Equality Referendum"}
