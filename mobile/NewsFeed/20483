They will contribute to isolation and social exclusion of many young people, limiting their ability to participate full in our society. These cuts are a form of abuse to young people in a country that has seen unemployment soar by 70%.&rdquo;</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">David Gibney from Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) Youth and Mandate Trade Union said that &ldquo;the decision was made to protect the rich&rdquo; and condemned the government&rsquo;s decision to &ldquo;go after the soft targets&rdquo; and not to target the wealthy in society.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The young are not in unions, generally, they don&rsquo;t vote in the numbers that the elderly vote in, and they can emigrate easier. That is the reality of the factor and that is why we&rsquo;ve been targeted.&rdquo;</p>\r\nA youth assembly titled &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Not Leaving!&rdquo; by the Young People&rsquo;s Assembly will be taking place on the 9th of November in Liberty Hall.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/protestfrontgates.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20483", "Heading": "Students protest against reductions in welfare payments for young people"}
