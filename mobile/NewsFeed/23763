Participants will self-administer two online treatments with support, and the effectiveness of the practice will be subsequently assessed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The trial conducted by Trinity is to focus on generalised anxiety symptoms among students, seen particularly around exam time, and has recruited 150 subjects. A primary objective of the technology is to teach candidates new ways of managing stress, worry, and anxiety.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dr Derek Richards, Director of Clinical Research &amp; Innovation at SilverCloud Health, Research Fellow in the School of Psychology, and the project&rsquo;s principal investigator, is optimistic about the outcome. &ldquo;Based on the success achieved to date with supported online treatments,\" he commented, &ldquo;we believe that the participants in both trials will demonstrate significant decreases in symptoms post-intervention.&rdquo; He cited a number of countries in which the practice has already proven effective, such as Sweden, Amsterdam, and Australia.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Richards: &ldquo;we need new ways to reach students&rdquo;, as college services are already overburdened and numerous studies have shown that traditional pathways are &ldquo;not top of the list&rdquo; for the college-going population. He further noted that &ldquo;technology is already pervasive in students&rsquo; lives&rdquo;, stressing that &ldquo;online treatment is not a novelty, but a demand.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Richards also offered evidence suggesting that online treatment may be &ldquo;as effective a method of intervention as conventional face-to-face treatment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aware are conducting a joint study evaluating the effectiveness of the same method in treating depression. The 300 participants recruited are to receive support from Aware-trained \u00a0volunteers with experience using the technology, in addition to the two self-administered online treatments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Co-principal investigator Dr Ladislav Timulak, Course Director of Trinity's Doctorate in Counselling Psychology, is equally hopeful about the outcome, citing the UK&rsquo;s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&rsquo;s existing recommendation that some online interventions be used as part of a stepped-care healthcare provision. &ldquo;This replaces waiting lists,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and may be an effective intervention on its own.&rdquo; He added: &ldquo;these interventions should be particularly suitable for people with mild to moderate forms of depression.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anxiety and depression continue to be pressing issues in Ireland, with an estimated 36% of the adult student population suffering clinical anxiety and prevalence rates of depression between 7.9% and 12.3% among the common population.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Photo by Andrew Murphy</em></p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/11967661923_4cd07fa89c_z.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23763", "Heading": "Trinity-Led Study to Investigate Online Treatment of Anxiety and Depression"}
