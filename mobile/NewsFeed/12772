O'Brien, presented with the award by Provost Patrick Prendergast,\u00a0received\u00a0a standing ovation from students who had queued for hours to see him. <em>Conan</em> struck poses with his medal before the cameras, while his famous hair stood a good six inches above his head.\r\n\r\nConan whipped out paper from his back pocket like a cowboy in a quick draw. \u00a0He thanked the Phil, saying he was 'overjoyed to be made honorary patron' and upon receipt of his Phil invite, could finally claim to have 'made it'.\r\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">Conan whipped out paper from his back pocket like a cowboy in a quick draw</blockquote>\r\nConan remarked that viewing the Facebook pages of Trinity students, filled with 'lust, depravity, drunkenness&hellip;A naked slave auction&hellip;Men wearing bras&hellip;Women wearing no bras' \u00a0felt like he was 'watching the fall of Rome.' \u00a0A forty-nine year old man, he claimed to have downloaded some of the facebook photos he found of students and fold them into his wallet. \u00a0He followed this remark with a cheeky wag of his finger at attractive female committee members whose photos he allegedly kept. \u00a0'Today' he said, 'you&rsquo;re honoring a pervert.' With the audience in a fit of laughter, Conan went on to poke fun at Trinity&rsquo;s obsession with the Book of Kells. \u00a0He said Trinity is 'coasting on a thousand year old book&hellip;get over it!'\r\n\r\nThe chat show host related to his audience by appealing to what it means to be Irish. \u00a0According to Conan, he was 'genetically engineered to live [in Dublin],' and that living in Los Angeles makes him feel like a 'penguin in the Lebanon zoo'. Despite his family leaving Dungarvin, County Waterford around the time of American Civil War, Conan claims he is 100% Irish. \u00a0In his own words, his\u00a0family moved to America in 1850 and then 'proceeded to marry each other'. \u00a0This has led O'Brien to draw the conclusion that he is 'dangerously inbred'.\r\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">the &rsquo;comedic philosophy is not to have one.</blockquote>\r\nConan thought the Philosophical Society would like to hear about his personal philosophy, so he said, 'as soon as I get one, I will email it to you&hellip;as one easily downloadable pdf.'. \u00a0He claimed that the \u00a0'comedic philosophy is not to have one.' and \u00a0he enjoys people who make him laugh like Peter Sellers, the Marx Brothers, and the cat on YouTube who plays the keyboard.\r\n\r\nRelating to the essence of what it feels like being Irish, Conan said 'like you, I bruise easily and have a tendency to blame others for my problems'. O&rsquo;Brien offered some words of wisdom to those in attendance, claiming \u00a0'no one looks good in lycra shorts' and 'if you go to Disneyland, pretend to be disabled and request a wheelchair. \u00a0They have to give you one and you skip straight to the front of every line!'\r\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">like you, I bruise easily and have a tendency to blame others for my problems</blockquote>\r\nReflecting on his time as a writer for the <em>The Simpsons</em>, O'Brien said \u00a0his first day at the dilapidated offices of Fox studios was to be one the strangest days of his life. \u00a0Conan left his new office to grab a coffee and heard a weird noise. \u00a0He came in to find the window broken and a large black bird lying on its back, wings open, dead on the floor. \u00a0The bird had broken the window, broken its neck against the wall and died. \u00a0A fellow writer walked past him and said 'bad sign man' while shaking his head. \u00a0Conan enjoyed his time at The Simpsons, but after a while he knew if 'I didn&rsquo;t get out of there my head was going to explode.'\r\n\r\nWhen asked about strange obsessive fans, Conan said an Irish Catholic priest once threatened to kill him and another man made a 9ft tall Conan O&rsquo;Brien figure out of 600,000 legos. \u00a0He lamented that sometimes people read too much into the meaning behind his words. \u00a0He said he never has a message behind his humor, yet some fans subscribe to a cult of personality around him. \u00a0Conan claimed, 'I know what it's like to be Stalin' because a crazed fan would probably kill for him if he asked them to, which is why he hasn&rsquo;t.\r\n\r\nAn audience member asked Conan how he got his slash and burn comedy style. \u00a0He said he got this style during his time at the <em>Harvard Lampoon</em>. \u00a0Conan said he just tries to have fun with his show, having a 'nervous breakdown&hellip;Acting like a cat and dancing.' Although his life is incredibly fun, Conan told how he misses when nobody knew him. \u00a0When he was in London a month ago, a place where O'Brien never found the same degree of fame as in the US, the only people who recognized him were American tourists and he said he felt free. \u00a0Yet, he wouldn&rsquo;t trade his life for the world. \u00a0He got his job on the Late Show, as he put it, 'on a lark'. \u00a0He went to the audition knowing he had no chance, so the pressure was off and he put in a stellar performance. \u00a0For the following year and a half, he received nothing but horribly negative feedback from Americans. \u00a0The Canadians kept him afloat.\r\n\r\nIn one of the final questions from the floor a girl asked, 'If you could define your career in one word, what would it be?' \u00a0To this, Conan O&rsquo;Brien replied, 'Unexpected.'<strong id=\"internal-source-marker_0.751519831828773\">\n</strong>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/307933_482923668404758_723635900_n.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12772", "Heading": "Conan O'Brien at the Phil"}
