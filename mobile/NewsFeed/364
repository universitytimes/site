The diminuitive piano virtuoso adopted a decidedly &ldquo;laissez-faire&rdquo; attitude to the set, even joking at the begining that he was quite hungover. Diminished brain cells, however, clearly had no effect on Cullum&rsquo;s ability to entertain as he delighted students with a repertoire of jazz standard covers.

The ensuing impromtu session saw Trinity&rsquo;s finest jazz enthusiasts jamming with Cullum on stage &ndash; one even pulling out a saxaphone. Afterwards Cullum thanked the Jazz Society, saying &ldquo;Thanks for joining me on the blues. I bet you guys have killer jam sessions.&rdquo;</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>Jamie Cullum played to a packed Players Theatre on the Friday afternoon of Freshers Week 2009, bringing Jazz Soc&rsquo;s Freshers events to a dazzling close.
