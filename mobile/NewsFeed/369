{"Body": "<p>The Central Societies Committee has decided to allocate a week to celebrating the community and collegiality which is created by Trinity&rsquo;s diverse range of societies. This week will take place during the fourth week of college, from the 19th to the 23rd of October. During this week a number of events will be taking place. These all include promoting and encouraging communications and awareness within societies. The CSC will be asking societies to publicise the fact that they are a part of the CSC, and to put the Fourth week logo on all their posters for that week. The CSC is a body that supports and funds societies within Trinity.</p>\n<p>Honourary Treasurer of the CSC Joe O&rsquo;Gorman hopes to make this an annual event, as he sees it as an opportunity for the societies to showcase themselves outside of Freshers&rsquo; week. This will also afford students another chance to join societies which they may not have heard of, or been aware of during that initial week of college. O&rsquo;Gorman will also be taking the chance to announce initiaves that the CSC will be undertaking over the coming year. An example of one such initiative is the Dorian Gray Project. This will be the photograghing of society chairs, which will then be made into protraits. The idea is to store these portraits for ten years and then release them to those who were photographed as a reminder of who they were ten years ago. &ldquo;It is a sort of link back to one&rsquo;s past in college;&rdquo; O&rsquo;Gorman stated. A mosaic will then be created with miniature versions of the portraits.</p>\n<p>This project will be launched on the night of the 19th, at a special Commons for Society chairs. Many members of college staff will also be present. This is being promoted a networking evening, where society members will get the chance to meet each other, and maybe discuss working together in the future The photographs however will be taken at a later date during the year. Another event which is being run is a coffee morning, here society members will get the opportunity to discuss what the CSC is currently doing, and what they can be doing better. The aim of this is to create better communication so as to improve the body&rsquo;s effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Robert Kearns, Chair of the CSC is looking especially forward to the Dorian Gray event which is being held; he sees this as &ldquo;a way of celebrating diversity in Trinity.&rdquo;</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>The Central Societies Committee has decided to allocate a week to celebrating the community and collegiality which is created by Trinity&rsquo;s diverse range of societies.
