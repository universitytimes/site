{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It has emerged that a Tesco supermarket will be one of a number of shops to occupy the ground-floor space of the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute on Pearse Street. These reports emerged amid speculation that the space in question had not been put out on tender prior to the arrangement, claims to which Trinity has responded stating that this was not necessary, as per the development agreement.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The ground level of the Trinity Biomedical Sciences Institute will accommodate a number of retail units one of which will accommodate a proposed convenience supermarket that is to be let to the supermarket chain, Tesco,&rdquo; a representative of Trinity stated. The remaining ground floor retail units will be allocated to various other shops, caf\u00e9s and restaurants - one of which, Arabica Coffee Co., has already been set up. US education publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (HMH) have also rented part of the office space above.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Biomedical Sciences Institute forms part of Trinity Central, which also houses the new entrance to Pearse Train and DART station, Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann&rsquo;s busiest hub, surpassing 9.3 million passengers annually.The building, which opened in June 2011, consists of 35,000m2 on 11 storeys, 11,000m2 of which were purpose-built for commercial use, rented out by Irish construction company and developer P.J. Walls. It received &euro;80 million in state funding and &euro;3.2 million from alumni of the School to build, and houses the School of Biochemistry and Immunology, School of Chemistry, School of Medicine, School of Bioengineering, and School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Responding to allegations that the space in question had not been put out to tender prior to the arrangement in line with EU law, Trinity&rsquo;s statement clarified that: &ldquo;There is no requirement for Trinity to undertake a tender process in relation to the acquisition or disposal of property. The rental arrangement in the building are essentially the responsibility of the developer, subject to the terms of the development agreement.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Walls Developments website outlines the company&rsquo;s hopes for the space: &ldquo;Trinity Central is bringing great vibrancy to Pearse Street and with the significant ground floor retail shopping concourse providing key amenities for local residents and the College population, it has dramatically changed and rejuvenated the streetscape.&rdquo;</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/central_big.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19905", "Heading": "Tesco Branch Set for Biomedical Sciences Building"}
