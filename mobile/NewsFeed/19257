{"Body": "With the referendum on abolishing the Seanad only weeks away, the Union of Students in Ireland (USI) yesterday launched its campaign for a &lsquo;No&rsquo; vote, calling for &ldquo;a more democratic and inclusive&rdquo; upper house.\r\n\r\nThe USI has identified several steps towards &ldquo;real and meaningful reform&rdquo; in its\u00a0<i>Free Our Voice\u00a0</i>proposal, such as increased political responsibility for the Seanad to review past legislation and produce evidence-based policy reports.\r\n<blockquote>&ldquo;The Seanad is a fundamental organ of the State,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor asserted. &ldquo;Abolishing the Seanad does not do anything to fix our broken democracy.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\nInstead, the proposal calls for disbanding the Economic Management Council, a D\u00e1il cabinet chaired by Taoiseach Enda Kenny and comprising T\u00e1naiste\u00a0Eamon Gilmore, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan and Minister for Public Expenditure\u00a0Brendan Howlin.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at the campaign launch, USI President Joe O&rsquo;Connor added to recent criticism of the EMC from public representatives such as Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin and Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton.\r\n\r\nO&rsquo;Connor advocated &ldquo;a more consultative approach,&rdquo; claiming that the EMC\u00a0operates &ldquo;without any real transparency or consultation. This type of all-powerful committee has no place within a democracy.&rdquo;\r\n\r\nFurther USI proposals promise greater political inclusion by electing one representative from the Traveller, LGBT and migrant communities each, as well as one representative of people with disabilities, one under the age of 25 and one non-political expert. The USI also seeks a 50:50 gender balance in nominees for the Seanad.\r\n\r\nPlacing an additional focus on &ldquo;promoting youth engagement,&rdquo; the\u00a0<i>Free Our Voice</i>\u00a0publication seeks to reduce the voting age to 16, in line with suggestions from the Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nO&rsquo;Connor called for all graduates to be granted voting power in Seanad elections. Universities currently elect six Senators to Seanad \u00c9ireann, three of whom&mdash;David Norris, Ivana Bacik, and Sean Barrett at present&mdash;are elected by graduates of Trinity College Dublin.\r\n\r\nWhile TCD is affiliated with USI, TCD Students&rsquo; Union is not required to share the political views of the national union. USI will be publicising its campaign across institutes of third-level education in the coming weeks.\r\n\r\nOn Monday September 9, a petition was presented to TCD Students&rsquo; Union calling for a policy referendum on the future of Seanad \u00c9ireann.\u00a0The referendum will be officially called next Monday if Academic Registry verifies the student status of at least 250 of the 309 signatures submitted.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC01010-620x350.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19257", "Heading": "USI Calls for Seanad Retention and Reform"}
