Colloquially known as R.B., McDowell was considered to be one of Trinity&rsquo;s most beloved public figures and many associated with the college will be deeply saddened to learn of his demise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBorn in Belfast in 1913, McDowell began his love for education and, in particular, history at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution. He later went on to read History in TCD, where he became a scholar, and he was first appointed a lecturer in 1945. It is in Trinity College that R.B. McDowell would spend almost the entirety of his career, retiring at the age of 90.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nR.B. McDowell was always extremely engaged in student life, as well as preserving and, in fact, heightening the history of Trinity College. He took the role of Junior Dean of Students in 1956 and kept that position until 1969, seeing the student populous through one of the most exciting and turbulent eras in student life; the 1960&rsquo;s.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMcDowell remained a lecturer in Trinity for decades, but he was also a highly acclaimed historian. His prime focus as a writer was mainly Irish history from the 17<sup>th</sup> century onwards, as well as the history of his beloved Trinity College.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLike many Trinity public figures, McDowell was, perhaps, best loved for his old-world wit and charm. His passion for TCD was deep-rooted and he spent his life promoting the College, and for this all TCD students should be greatful.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven after retiring at the age of 90, McDowell still resided on campus until the age of 94, after which he moved to Celbridge.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMcDowell&rsquo;s presence on campus will be sorely missed by anyone involved in Trinity life. His funeral will take place at 2.30 p.m. on Monday 5th September 2011 at Mount Jerome Crematorium.\u00a0 A memorial service will be held in the College Chapel on Thursday 20th October 2011 at 5.15 p.m.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "3950", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "3949", "Heading": "RIP R.B.
