{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Emer Gerrard\u00a0</strong>| Contributing Writer</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Union of Students in Ireland (USI) has released a ten-point plan outlining the steps they believe should be taken &ldquo;in order for Ireland to get back on its feet post-bailout&rdquo;. The plan focuses heavily on student-related issues, while also discussing ideas to improve society in general. The Union summaries its vision as a path to &ldquo;lasting and sustainable economic development&rdquo; and &ldquo;social equality&rdquo;.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Vision is a path to\u00a0&ldquo;lasting and sustainable economic development&rdquo; and &ldquo;social equality&rdquo;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Among the issues raised is Higher Education funding; the Union underlines the value of third-level education, stating that the benefits from investment in education are &ldquo;unquestionable&rdquo;. Student loans and deferred payment schemes are not an option according to the Union, pointing to the &ldquo;crippling student debt&rdquo; acquired in other countries.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Union also argues for efforts to deal with youth unemployment, describing the government&rsquo;s recent attempt to overcome the 30% youth unemployment rate as &ldquo;at best inadequate and at worst measly and derogatory&rdquo;. This relates to the &euro;14 million which the government allocated to the Youth Guarantee scheme in the recent budget. The Union believes that an investment of almost twenty times this amount is necessary.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government efforts to tackle youth unemployment have been\u00a0&ldquo;at best inadequate and at worst measly and derogatory\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">USI President Joe O&rsquo;Connor states: &ldquo;We may not have brought about the economic difficulties this country finds itself in, but we want to play our part in helping to resolve them.&rdquo; The broad range of issues addressed in the vision includes reforming the political system, relieving mortgage debt on hard-pressed families and scraping the waste in public spending.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Issues of social justice are raised in the plan with the Union advocating legislating for collective bargaining in all industries and improved social housing. USI urge for a &ldquo;living wage&rdquo; to be introduced in reaction to an &ldquo;erosion of workers&rsquo; pay and conditions&rdquo; during the recession. Furthermore they call on the government to end the current embargo on public sector recruitment and criticise its &ldquo;JobBridge&rdquo; scheme, arguing that it has led some young people to be &ldquo;forced to work 40-hour weeks for less than &euro;4 an hour under the guise of an internship.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We may not have brought about the economic difficulties this country finds itself in, but we want to play our part in helping to resolve them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The plan also acknowledges the psychological impacts resulting from the recession, &ldquo;particularly on young people&rdquo;, and calls for a &euro;50 million investment in mental health services in Budget 2015. It also appeals for action on the recent &ldquo;accommodation crisis&rdquo; for students, &ldquo;particularly in Dublin&rdquo;, and endorses legislation to curb the cost of rent prices.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">USI believe that their vision could accomplish &ldquo;economic growth, job creation and the creation of a great society&rdquo;, while a &ldquo;return to recession&rdquo; would be avoided. O&rsquo;Connor maintains: &ldquo;Now that we as a country have regained our economic sovereignty, it is time that we put an end to short-term thinking and start working towards shaping the future we want for Ireland.&rdquo;</p>\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/president-usi271-390x285.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22954", "Heading": "USI Releases Post-Bailout Vision for Ireland"}
