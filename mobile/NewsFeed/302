{"Body": "<p>University College Dublin has introduced a health charge for students during the coming academic year. The fees will apply to students seeking GP and nurse services.&nbsp; Previously these services were free, however due to the current economic climate the College stated that they were unable to maintain these services free-of-charge. From September 7th last students have been charged &euro;25 to see a doctor, &euro;10 to see a nurse and &euro;40 for a psychiatric consultation. UCD stated however that the student counselling service would remain free.</p>\n<p>UCD Students&rsquo; Union have supported the decision, after being consulted by the college authorities, that it was a necessary move, &lsquo;UCD has to balance its books and cutbacks have to be made across the board&rsquo; said president of UCD students&rsquo; union Gary Redmond. Students will not have to pay on the spot, rather their accounts will be charged and they will have to pay it within ten days.</p>\n<p>Redmond went on to say that; &lsquo;A UCDSU Welfare fund will be able to provide the money if students are unable to pay the charge. This is to ensure vulnerable students would be protected.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>In a separate issue at NUIG, where there was much speak of a health charge also,&nbsp; college authorities updated the Health service information on the website to include a charge for students. The charge was &euro;5, yet many of the students&rsquo; parents demanded that the charge be removed. The college grudgingly did so yet stated that the introduction of a fee was a very strong possibility in the near future.</p>\n<p>Trinity will not be introducing a health service charge, however there has been speak of it. According to sources close to the Provost the issue is scheduled for discussion over the coming months. Speaking last year, the Director of the College Health Service Dr McGrath stated that they had no plans to charge students for standard doctor visits. He went on to say that were any charges envisaged they would first be discussed with the student representatives. So far no contact has been made with any of the student representatives within Trinity.</p>\n<p>Trinity Welfare Officer Cormac Cashman stated, &ldquo;The Students&rsquo; Union is strongly against the introduction of a health service charge for Trinity students. This would affect the most vulnerable students in the College community and would be grossly unfair as this is a service which has long endured. It&nbsp; is a great service and it would be a pity if students could no longer afford to avail of it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; The College Health Service was established in 1965 and aims to provide on-campus primary health care for all full-time students.</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>University College Dublin has introduced a health charge for students during the coming academic year.
