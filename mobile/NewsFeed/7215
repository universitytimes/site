It accused the government of putting at risk the country's research and development sector, \"which is vital to our economic recovery\".\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HQ86DKi5JhNBa1Rh-Oy0r1TN5UigIEDeh169LJdu9PM/edit\">The Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014</a>, the measures of which were read out by Minister Howlin, said that \"increases to student contributions have been kept to the minimum possible\". Despite what Mr. Howlin called \"difficult choices\" the report said that the government had sought to ensure \"higher education continues to make a full contribution to Ireland&rsquo;s development and recovery\".\n\nWhile existing grant-holders will be unaffected by today's cuts, the postgraduate maintenance grant will be scrapped for prospective students. <a href=\"http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/third_level_education/fees_and_supports_for_third_level_education/maintenance_grant_schemes_for_students_on_third_level_courses.html\">\"Special rate students\"</a> at postgraduate level, those whose total reckonable income in the tax year January to December (which is often assessed on the basis of their parents' or guardians' incomes)\u00a0is not more than &euro;22,703, will have their fees subsidised but receive no maintenance grant. A system to implement a \"&euro;2,000 fee contribution grant to a further 4,000 students\" will also be put in place.\n\nAdditional measures announced today by Minister Howlin included a the \"introduction from 2013 of a capital asset test\" and a reduction of 20% in the allocation given to the Students with Disabilities fund. In total the cuts amounted to &euro;132.3m with &euro;23.6m cut from the core funding of higher-level education. The education budget next year, Minister Howlin said, would make up 17% of the &euro;8.6billion budget for current spending.\n\nUSI President Gary Redmond characterised the cuts as \"regressive and short-sighted\" and said they would \"exclude thousands of would-be students from education\". \"The promises laid out in glossy election manifestos which were loudly trumpeted by candidates less nine months ago, now lie in tatters along with the credibility of this government&rsquo;s stated aim of building long-term sustainable economic growth\", he said.", "Imageurl": "7224", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "7215", "Heading": "&euro;2,250 Student Contribution \"Will Cause Enormous Hardship\" - USI"}
