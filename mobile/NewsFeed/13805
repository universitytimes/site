The project will focus on improving literacy levels in disadvantaged secondary schools in the inner city by conducting &lsquo;newspaper&rsquo; workshops and having the students take part in writing competitions. Write-Up&rsquo;s primary goal is to teach disadvantaged students about journalism and to give them the tools to pursue a career in the field.\n\nTeam Leader of the Enactus Committee Arthur McKey is the founder of Write-Up and plans to have the project up and running by January. Four competitions will be run in the schools from January to April, with the four winners competing for the overall prize of &lsquo;a day in the life of a journalist&rsquo; in The Irish Times.\n\nMcKey is proposing to carry out needs assessments on secondary schools based on literacy levels and the number of early school leavers. Write-Up hopes to target schools based in areas with high unemployment levels and low rates of literacy. A system has already been put in place whereby Write-Up will be able to liaise with the schools themselves to conduct a pilot run.\n&ldquo;Essentially, the way it&rsquo;s going to run is we are going to offer a topic every month,&rdquo; explained McKey. &ldquo;For example, maybe on the second Wednesday of every month we will offer a topic or a title and a deadline. We want it to be as realistic as possible. On the fourth Wednesday they would submit their entry. On the Friday of that week, we would like to judge all the submissions and publish the submission on the UT website.&rdquo;\n\nWrite-Up will run writing workshops for 4th to 6th year classes to teach the students about formatting, structure and grammar and will to set up its own dedicated website to publish as many students&rsquo; articles as possible.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13807\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"370\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/12/03/enactus-tcd-and-the-university-times-launch-literacy-initiative/enactus_1-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13807\"><img class=\" wp-image-13807 \" title=\"ENACTUS_1\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ENACTUS_13.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"370\" height=\"245\" /></a> McKey: &ldquo;One of the main criteria of an Enactus project is that it has to be empowering,&rdquo;[/caption]\n\n&ldquo;One of the main criteria of an Enactus project is that it has to be empowering,&rdquo; said McKey. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about knowledge transfer, because once we have knowledge transfer we can have an increased sense of empowerment. If they have something that they&rsquo;re proud of they can just post it on their facebook and share it with their friends.&rdquo;\n\nEnactus are currently looking for a project leader to solidify the groundwork of Write-Up. In addition, a relationship manager to liaise with the schools, a PR manager and a marketing manager are needed for the project. Up to twelve volunteers are also needed to run the operations.\n\nFor more information, if you would like to apply for any of the positions on the Write-Up team or if you simply want to get involved, contact <a href=\"mailto:enactustcd@gmail.com\">enactustcd@gmail.com</a>.", "Imageurl": "13806", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13805", "Heading": "Enactus TCD and The University Times Launch Literacy Initiative"}
