{"Body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The recent Daft.ie Rental Report for the second quarter of 2010 details falling prices for rentals in Dublin and across the country.&nbsp; According to the Report, national rents are down 20-30% from their 2007 highs, with Dublin rental costs falling at a greater rate than anywhere else, over 30% in that time. This means that average rental costs for Dublin city apartments are between &euro;323 and &euro;404 p/m for single rooms and &euro;402 and &euro;501 for doubles.</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">The Report opened with an introduction by USI President Gary Redmond heralding the end of the days when &ldquo;students paid more for accommodation&rdquo;.&nbsp; While this may be the case for some students, it is certainly not the case for those of Trinity College. The cost of renting a Trinity College property in Dublin city for a month in 2010 comes in at an average of between &euro;515 and &euro;615, judging by the figures presented in the 2010 brochure. These prices have risen slightly since 2007, despite large national falls in that time.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Tony Dempsey, the College Accommodation Officer, says that these rents &ldquo;are set annually at a level that covers the full economic cost of operating residences.&rdquo; He added that &ldquo;while some note is taken of the private sector&rdquo; the price differential of well over &euro;100 a month exists because the &ldquo;cost base and level of services&rdquo; provided by College exceeds that of the private sector. These services would include the wardens used in some facilities, highlighting the extra cost of operating supervised accommodation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Semesterisation, according to Mr. Dempsey, has placed additional pressure on the accommodation system because &ldquo;residential income has decreased without corresponding decreases in overheads or fixed costs&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">However, the reluctance of College to lower the cost of accommodation, despite enormous decreases in the employment level of third-level age students, is something that should be &ldquo;reconsidered&rdquo; according to Steph Fleming, the SU&rsquo;s Welfare Officer. &ldquo;Students in general feel that the cost of Trinity housing is too much. The Accommodation Office has made little effort to reflect the change in the market. Students have less money than they have had in recent years and the costs in College just aren&rsquo;t competitive.&rdquo; She also told The University Times that the SU will be raising this issue in the coming year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Neither the Daft.ie nor the Trinity costs include utilities. While the vast majority of rental properties in Dublin meter these charges, Trinity continues to apply a blanket charge. Mr. Dempsey put the failure to meter water or heating charges down to a system that used large, communal boilers instead of smaller, individual ones. This, he said, was &ldquo;far more energy efficient.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">However, electricity is also subject to blanket charges. This differs from U.C.D., U.C.C. and other large Colleges where students staying in residences are charged per usage. In this case the Accommodation Officer claimed it was not &ldquo;practical or economic&rdquo; to meter readings, saying that experience showed that electricity was a &ldquo;relatively minor&rdquo; part of utility charges and there was a &ldquo;limited variation in consumption&rdquo; between rooms.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">This argument seems to disregard the potential large difference between rooms that could exist if metered charges were applied. Students seeking to save money or those who were made more conscious of their energy usage would have the opportunity to use less.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">A background to this is the increased questioning of Trinity&rsquo;s commitment to fighting Climate Change. Steph Fleming highlights Trinity&rsquo;s recent involvement in the e3 strategy, a drive to reduce energy consumption by 10%. &ldquo;Trinity did not reach this target&rdquo;, she says, &ldquo;despite aiming for it in just 8 buildings. Trinity is meant to be promoting a climate friendly environment and telling students that they have as much energy as they can use is hardly in line with these aspirations.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">The core of the problem appears to be College&rsquo;s prioritising short-term cost at the expense of long-term gains. The cost of its accommodation is adding pressure to students, with grants down 5% and a 69% increase in student service charges in the last 12 months. The discrepancy in costs also leaves College potentially vulnerable in a competitive rental market.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">But the issue of metering seems to be an area where policy is a net loss to everyone. Its savings compare poorly with failures to promote a culture of energy responsibility or live up to its promises in the field of the environment. An adjustment here would go some way to tackling both problems, according to the Welfare Officer, because it would provide &ldquo;an excellent opportunity to save money and an incentive to save energy.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">This short-term thought is doubtlessly influenced by the tough nature of the economy. The drive to cut costs has picked up pace in the last 12 months. In a recent address to the education sector, T&aacute;naiste Mary Coughlan spoke of the need for them to get &ldquo;more for less&rdquo;. If patterns in the College continue, however, it is clear that students will get less for more.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The recent Daft.ie Rental Report for the second quarter of 2010 details falling prices for rentals in Dublin and across the country.&nbsp; According to the Report, national rents are down 20-30% from their 2007 highs, with Dublin rental costs falling at a greater rate than anywhere else, over 30% in that time.
