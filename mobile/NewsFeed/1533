{"Body": "It may have been the longest two weeks of my life but I can say that I am officially sad now that the dust has finally settled on the 2011 TCDSU elections. It was a weird and wonderful couple of weeks that culminated in an equally weird and tense night in the Montclare Hotel off Merrion Square. The teams and candidates arrived in dribs and drabs, but by the end of the night the hotel bar was bursting with campaign colours and well-dressed candidates. For some, the intensely packed and incredibly hot conditions would be worth the final result. For others, there would be no reprieve or relief. As the condensation built up on the windows so too did the nervousness of the crowd. And then the first result was called.\n\n<strong>Communications:</strong>\n\nAfter it was announced that the student centre levy had not passed the student vote and that Colm Kearney had received the highest proportion of the student vote in the Provostial elections it came down to Ashley Cooke to shout out the results of the first race of the night. This was a race which was characterized by the \"one-up-manship\" of the two candidates. Each had fought tough publicity battles for our attention; Costello with his fetishization of ginger-dom and Eleni with her bear mascot and face-painting. In the end there was a clear winner with Ronan Costello sweeping up 64% of the vote to Eleni's 32%. In the end Costello's flashy Facebook design, \"ginger snaps\" and \"Dummy's guide\" did enough to beat Eleni's relatively pedestrian campaign.\n\n<strong>Education:</strong>\n\nThe education candidates were the next two to have their tension relieved. After two intense weeks of mud-slinging and controversial comments everyone's favourite odd-couple have stopped their bitching and laid down arms. This blogger is not sure what is going to amuse him on a day to day basis now that this race has come to its conclusion. With Rachel Barry taking 57% of the valid poll and John Cooney taking 40% we had a clear winner on the first count. No doubt the two candidates are delighted that the ordeal has come to a close. It was an upsetting and intense race and it ended all too soon for us student journalists. While the two candidates congratulated each other and apologized for the mudslinging on both sides, I can't see Cooney being on Barry's Christmas card list next year.\n\n<strong>Welfare:</strong>\n\nIt was a long wait until the next result was announced. In this waiting period the hotel manager closed down the bar, locked everyone in and a few annoyed smokers out and it also emerged that Seb LeCocq campaign manager Danny O'Keefe had fallen down the front steps of the hotel and snotted himself on the concrete. An interesting waiting period but not a very comfortable one for the people who were starting to sober up and the smokers locked outside. Nevertheless, rumour had managed to get around that Louisa Miller had won the race. It was a long time before that rumour was confirmed but when it was, a cry of jubilation launched forth from the crowd of yellow t-shirted Miller supporters. Miller received exactly half the total valid votes with Darren O'Gorman coming in at 24%, Russell Bryce at 13% and Caroline Keating at 10%. It was an emotional end to a long and well-fought campaign for Darren O'Gorman. He ran an impressive campaign for such a young student and received a respectable proportion of the vote. Popular opinion seems to be in favour of Darren running again next year.\n\n<strong>Ents:</strong>\n\nBy the time this result was called, I must admit, I had left the\u00a0bar and was sitting on the steps outside in desperate need of some fresh air after the insanely cramped and humid conditions inside the hotel. Nevertheless, I watched the tweets that were coming from the count room and probably had a better idea of the how the result was panning out than the campaigners inside the hotel. We knew this was going to be tight; we never realized it would be as tight as 3%. Initially, we thought that the first count was going to be the last but we had to wait just a little but longer for the real result. There was wailing in the street but chanting from within the hotel when it was announced that Chris O'Connor had received 50% of the vote and Elaine had received 47%. A more frustrating result for Elaine's campaign team could not be imagined. There were rivers of mascara flowing down Westland Row initially but after Chris had celebrated inside the hotel, he joined his team outside for the obligatory group hug and chanting of the \"Barbara Streisand\" chorus. It was all very emotional in this race. Congratulations are definitely in order for CO'C who ran a huge campaign but Elaine too should be proud of the calibre and strength of the campaign she ran. The tightness of this race is testament to both candidates' popularity and organizational skills and as this blogger has stated before, either way Trinity College was going to get an Ents officer to be proud of.\n\n<strong>Presidency:</strong>\n\nWell, he did it. Ryan Bartlett beat the notorious RON vote by a very respectable margin. Although receiving a total of 1330 RON votes, Ryan managed to mop up a 69% share of the votes. It was no surprise really but that does not in any way take from the fact that Bartlett and campaign manager, Daniel Ferrick put together and ran a well-oiled team of campaigners. I am, as @neilfitz101 put it on Twitter, \"looking forward to a year of shitty West-Wing jokes.\" All hail our \"Glorious Leader,\" Ryan Bartlett.\n\nSo that's it then; my last blog. I hope it has, at the very least, been entertaining. For me it's been.....educational shall we say. I hope I haven't made too many enemies. If I had anything to say to the candidates, the winners and losers alike, it would have to come in the form of a quote. The oldest cliche in the book is to compare something as exciting as an election to a ride in an amusement park. I have no problem likening the 2011 SU elections to a roller-coaster. To paraphrase Bill Hicks, \"[it went] up and down, around and around, it [had] thrills and chills, and it [was] very brightly colored, and it [was] very loud, and it [was] fun for a while.\" But I think we all need to remember that it was \"just a ride.\"", "Imageurl": "1539", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1533", "Heading": "Fear and Loathing on The Campaign Trail; The Farewell Edition."}
