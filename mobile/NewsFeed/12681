College currently offers a Bachelor in Music Education programme and that degree course is also set to benefit from any formal association of institutions.\n\nThe paper, authored by Provost Patrick Prendergast, concludes:\n<p align=\"LEFT\">'Partnership between Trinity College Dublin and the Royal Irish Academy of Music would produce a highly visible centre of musical excellence in Europe and beyond.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">'It would enhance Ireland&rsquo;s reputation as a force in the creative arts, demonstrated by a dynamic and thriving educational partnership which delivers outstanding 21st century performing artists, composers and scholars.</p>\n<p align=\"LEFT\">'These two institutions have the experience, history and credibility to grow together organically and to deliver on a vision that will resonate throughout Ireland for many decades to come.'</p>\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "12682", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/RIAM3", "ID": "12681", "Heading": "Royal Irish Academy of Music to become associated College of TCD"}
