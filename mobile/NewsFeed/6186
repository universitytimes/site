{"Body": "<strong>Leanna Byrne</strong>\n<em>News Editor</em>\n\nAcademic and administrative paid promotions are to go ahead, as confirmed by a College Board meeting on the 12th of last month. Last year, proposals to go ahead with promtions were abandoned by the College.\n\nThe Vice-Provost and Chief Academic Office, Professor Linda Hogan, encouraged the Board to draw attention to the initiation of the promotions process for academic and administrative, technical and support staff in this academic year. The terms of the academic employment control framework have made provisions for promotions within the confinements of staff numbers and staff ratios between grades.\n\nLast year, <em>The University Times</em> reported that 27 senior academics were promoted during the public sector promotions embargo. The Employment Control Framework issued by the government in 2008 to reduce staff numbers in the public service prohibits recruitment and promotions except in special approved circumstances. The move was soon withdrawn, but the Board have now found a way to by-pass this issue.\n\nThis year, the Board were confident that there is flexibility for a limited number of promotions as the university has delivered significant savings under the terms of the employment control framework and thus should not be expected to be constrained any further.\n\nSU President Ryan Bartlett commented that &ldquo;staff would not be moving above their levels, they would only be moving within categories.&rdquo; Promotions would not be made unless there was a number of staff with merit to receive a promotion or else if there was a position available. Furthermore, the proposal is only putting forward the introduction of a process.\n\nDespite the scope for promotions being present, the Board agreed that there were risks involved with initiating the process, including financial and compliance risks and limited capacity to reward excellence. To curb any objections, the proposal will undergo a rigorous review by the Senior Promotions Committee, the Human Resources Committee and an analysis of the full costing of promotions will be undertaken by the Planning Group.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Education and Skills had yet to respond to the Board&rsquo;s proposals for an Early Retirement Scheme. This suggests that the department have not accepted the promotions proposal and that the proposal may in fact be rejected by the department in light of the measurable budget cuts that they face.\n\nDuring the course of the discussions there were a number of issues raised by Board members included the fact that without any promotions the staff morale would be lacking. According to staff, even a small number of promotions would boost morale across the board. The promotions would be based on merit and would be open to all staff.\n\nIt was stated that, to avoid staff disappointment, it is vital that staff should be clearly informed of the limited capacity for paid promotion in an effort to manage expectations.\n\nRegardless of the issues that the proposal faces, the Board approved the Vice-Provost&rsquo;s recommendations on the reinstatement of the promotion process.", "Imageurl": "<strong>Leanna Byrne</strong>\n<em>News Editor</em>\n\nAcademic and administrative paid promotions are to go ahead, as confirmed by a College Board meeting on the 12th of last month.
