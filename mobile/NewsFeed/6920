USI set out to occupy Labour Party Headquarters, but their attempts were restricted by the locked doors. The occupation was subsequently moved to the Department of Jobs on Kildare Street and then followed by another reroute to the Department of Social Protection.\n\nBartlett was present at the occupation, but did not take part since he felt there were no clear indications that it would be in the interest of Trinity students. &ldquo;Most universities are linked with USI, but there are a few exceptions. There are a few things in particular that I don&rsquo;t think represent Trinity students, but I guess that&rsquo;s the way democracy works - the majority rule.&rdquo;He maintained that a possible escalation in the campaign to encompass an occupation was seen as a last resort and was not part of the agenda in the first national council meeting of the year. The decision to occupy government buildings was decided during a recent national council where all of the heads of the student unions convene.\n\n&ldquo;It was not part of the campaign plan, but it became part of the campaign plan fairly quickly from what I can tell. It was only mentioned in the discussions of the protest march after it was decided [the protest] would go ahead.&rdquo;When asked if he felt that the occupation achieved its aims, Bartlett advocated that the occupation did not go according to plan at all. &ldquo;The stated aims were to get the T\u00e1naiste to make a statement on Labour&rsquo;s position. Whether the occupation was trying to encompass everything else about the campaign is unclear. I guess you can never know what&rsquo;s going to happen next.&rdquo;\n\nIn an interview with DCUfm, Deputy President of USI Colm Murphy stated there were plans for further action. Bartlett denied that he had any knowledge of further action, claiming that if there are any extras that he was unaware of them. In addition, Bartlett said that he would only support other USI demonstrations if Trinity students supported it.&ldquo;Trinity is a constituent organisation of USI currently and the SU council mandated that we support this campaign in the best interest of Trinity students. However, if Trinity students want us to do something else then we&rsquo;re willing to do that.&rdquo;\n\nIn light of today&rsquo;s events, Bartlett stressed that students will have their say on Trinity&rsquo;s stance on fees tomorrow evening at the Town Hall Meeting that will take place in the Joly Theater.&ldquo;Sometimes people agree with what people are saying, but not agreeing with how they&rsquo;re saying it. I think we have to be clear about that. Certain people are disagreeing with the arguments, but they&rsquo;re also disagreeing with the way in which the arguments are laid out.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "6921", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6920", "Heading": "Bartlett criticises USI occupation"}
