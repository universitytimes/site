The pilot scheme will involve the alternative allocation of around 40 undergraduate places in 2014, and could well set in motion an historic break-away from the current &lsquo;points race&rsquo; method of admitting students to third-level education.\n\nUnder the scheme, the allocation of places would be based on a combination of Leaving Certificate results, performance of students relative to others in their school (Relative \u00a0Performance Rank), and other &lsquo;contextual data&rsquo;, likely to be ascertained by means of an application form. This application form would give students an opportunity to explain why they \u00a0should be given a place on a particular course in Trinity for reasons other than traditional academic merit as determined by the Leaving Certificate.\n\nThe applications would be assessed by a final review panel likely to consist of 40 people, including Trinity academics and admissions officers as well as external and international experts. Students would be given the option to apply for the alternative entry route via the CAO \u00a0fater selecting Trinity as one of their preferred colleges.\n\nThe main goal of the reforms is to be able to admit those with passion and flair for their chosen subject, and those independent and critical thinkers whose potential is not being identified by the largely rote-learning based leaving certificate, explained Senior Lecturer Professor Patrick Geoghegan, the driving force behind the reforms. &lsquo;These are the people who will thrive at Trinity,&rsquo; he added.\n\nSpeaking to The University Times, Dr. Geoghegan explained that he also hopes that a new system would lead to increased diversity on campus. At present, all of Trinity&rsquo;s top twenty feeder schools are fee-paying schools located in the greater Dublin area. However, due to the relative performance component of the scheme, we are likely to see schools with little tradition of \u00a0sending students to Trinity make a bigger impact.\n\nThe relative performance rank would come into play, for example, where one student obtains 470 points and did the best in their school, and the other got 490 points but comes from a school in which 490 was an average score. The proposal would justify awarding the place to the \u00a0student with the lower score on the basis that the lower Leaving Certificate score may be more meaningful given the context in which it was achieved. The relative performance rank, however,\u00a0will be only one scale used in the assessment, and all three modalities (Leaving Certificate results, RPR and the supplementary assessments) will play an equal role in the assessment.\n\nIt is also suggested that the new scheme would ease the difficulties of certain EU students \u00a0attempting to gain a place in Trinity, as often the conversion of their results to leaving certificate points is unfavourable. The fact that this may be taken into account will be particularly significant to A-level candidates in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe scheme will run for at least two years. If it is a success, it will be expanded, with much \u00a0higher numbers of students being admitted in this way. The results of the study will be shared\u00a0with the other Irish Universities and Institutes of Technology, with many expected to follow suit with what is essentially a national pilot scheme. This prediction is made in light of the fact that the leaving certificate grading scale is likely to be reduced, which would lead to more instances of random selection if no supplementary assessment were available. Dr. Geoghegan and his team are particularly confident that if the scheme is successful, it will change undergraduate admissions in Ireland forever; &lsquo;If this is successful, Trinity will have proved that there is a better and a fairer way of doing things.&rsquo;\n\n&lsquo;As Ireland&rsquo;s leading university, we have a public and a moral obligation to attempt this.&rsquo;", "Imageurl": "12335", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12334", "Heading": "Trinity to Pilot Radical New Admissions Scheme"}
