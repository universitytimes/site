{"Body": "<strong>Owen Bennett</strong> | Editor\n\nBudget 2013 was announced this afternoon, with the government confirming a &euro;250 increase in the Student Contribution Charge among other cuts to the third level sector. Students of low means have been particularly affected, with a cut to the qualifying income threshold for the maintenance grant of 3% set to affect the grant application potential of almost 8,000 students.\n\nSpeaking after the announcement of the budget, a USI spokesperson said \"as with the rest of the budget, the Government has targeted those who cannot afford to be squeezed any further. Coming after the debacle with the SUSI system, which has left thousands of students waiting on vital assistance, this is a cruel and unnecessary blow\".\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13940\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"315\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/12/05/students-take-heavy-hit-in-budget-2013/noonan/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13940\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-13940\" title=\"noonan\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/noonan3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"315\" height=\"329\" /></a> The Minister for Finance Michael Noonan prior to the announcement of Budget 2013.

This is a budget which will have an adverse and long-lasting effect on both the quality and accessibility of higher education.\"\n\nGeneral grant rates have been maintained at their current rates, while the income threshold for students on the special grant rate at both undergraduate and\u00a0postgraduate\u00a0levels has also been maintained.\n\nMinister for Public Expenditure and Reform Brendan Howlin confirmed the Student Contribution Charge (SCC) would rise by &euro;250 each year before leveling out at &euro;3,000 in 2015. USI President John Logue said the increase in the SCC is\u00a0\"a bitter blow to families who are struggling to get their children through college. Labour&rsquo;s betrayal of students on this front is disgraceful. By 2015, Ruairi Quinn will have increased fees by more than any Minister for Education since they were abolished by his Labour colleague, Niamh Bhreathnach.\"\n\nThe Student Assistance Fund, a government resource which provides for students facing extreme or unexpected financial hardship has not been cut. However, the Cost of Education Allowance, a &euro;300 payment annual payment for mature students returning to education, will be discontinued next year.\n\nThe USI spokesperson said that in response to the budget, the organisation would now \"escalate its campaign to reverse these harsh and regressive measures\"\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "13940", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13933", "Heading": "Students Take Heavy Hit in Budget 2013"}
