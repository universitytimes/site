{"Body": "In an innovative move, Oxfam Ireland are now selling refurbished computers in order to generate funds for their overseas development projects tackling poverty.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oxfam&rsquo;s &ldquo;Born Again&rdquo; Range sells computers both online and in selected stores for affordable prices, advertised as being perfect for those students feeling the financial pinch as they recommence their studies. The prices for desktops and laptops start at &euro;120 and &euro;180 respectively.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Oxfam Ireland&rsquo;s Director of Trading Trevor Anderson said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Having access to a personal laptop or home desktop has become increasingly important for research, study and projects at school and college. Students can get a high quality computer for a fraction of the cost new while diverting machines away from local landfill and raising vital funds for our projects around the world.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All the laptops and desktops sold were once business computers used in offices all over Ireland and the UK.\u00a0Oxfam are now putting them to good use, helping not only people in poverty but also those who are finding it more difficult to buy brand new computer hardware.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the refurbishment process, the computer's hard drive is\u00a0either erased or fully replaced, a\u00a0brand\u00a0new\u00a0operating system is installed,\u00a0and the\u00a0computer is then tested to ensure it is in full working order. All laptops are fitted with applications such as Open Office and Adobe PDF Viewer.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Surfer desktop and laptop are for more general use and are \u00a0sold at the cheapest prices. For those students and families who are more avid users there are the Plus and Pro options which are faster and have more storage. They do however come with a price hike; desktops are &euro;180 while laptops come in at &euro;240. The Pro options are the most expensive in the range with desktops at &euro;240 and laptops at the price of &euro;290.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Every desktop and laptop sold will help to change the lives in people in severe poverty through our emergency response to situations like the current Syria crisis, long-term development projects and campaigning work,\" Anderson stated.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/92.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19609", "Heading": "Oxfam Sells Refurbished Laptops to Help Tackle Poverty"}
