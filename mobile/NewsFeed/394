{"Body": "<p>Trinity College Dublin has given funding priority to a Student Centre in a bid to be a leading example of how a university can contribute to society and change the campus life through promoting student activity.</p>\n<p>Although planning permission is yet to be confirmed, Students&rsquo; Union President C&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Broin is enthusiastic about how he expects the new Student Centre could enrich the student environment on campus.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s badly needed because there is currently no social space for students or for gigs,&rdquo; says &Oacute; Broin. &ldquo;It will add to student life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The Centre is planned to be situated in Luce Hall, which was formerly a sports hall. It is also scheduled to be finished by September 2011.</p>\n<p>&Oacute;&nbsp; Broin wished to stress that &ldquo;plans change&rdquo;, that there may be further development which will be revealed as information becomes available.</p>\n<p>The new Student Centre is hoped to provide new infrastructure, supports and services for students. A student space, gig space, internet cafe, bank, shop and health services are some of the numerous services that the SU President mentioned would be on offer to students.</p>\n<p>&Oacute; Broin also told The University Times that the Students&rsquo; Union offices would be moving from their traditional headquarters House 6 to the Student Centre. This would ultimately create more space for the university&rsquo;s numerous societies (approximately 100 societies) and clubs.</p>\n<p>This would benefit many clubs and societies as there is currently no communal space in which they can meet. As it stands, clubs and societies have to resort to meeting in unusual and inconvenient spaces.&nbsp; The Centre will contribute to clubs and societies being more organised, making them more accessible and structured for students who wish to participate.</p>\n<p>The Honorary Treasurer of Central Societies Committee Joseph O&rsquo;Gorman confirmed that plans to move some of the societies to the new Centre have been put in motion. Following talks that took place during the last Trinity term the CSC has also had a central role in the instigation of the Student Centre.</p>\n<p>The societies will have rooms that will take up part of the building along with the many services that will be on offer.</p>\n<p>Of course, such renowned societies such as the Philosophical Society and the Historical Society will still reside in the Graduates&rsquo; Memorial Building (GMB) and will remain student orientated.
