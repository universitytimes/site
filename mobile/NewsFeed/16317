The report also found that the SUSI model had not been sufficiently planned and tested prior to implementation.\n\nSUSI was introduced for the first time last year. It was set up to replace an application system which involved 33 VECs and 33 local authorities. In the first year, it processed only new grant applications. It was subject to widespread complaints about delays and high rates of rejection, forcing the Minister for Education to directly intervene and allocate additional staff to the body last November.\n\nThe latest data on grant allocations indicates that by March 22nd of this year, over 10,000 students were still awaiting grants.\n\nSpeaking to <em>The University Times</em>, USI President John Logue said the\u00a0independent\u00a0report on SUSI, conducted by Accenture, 'confirms that Minister Quinn&rsquo;s pursuit of radical reductions in public sector costs undermined the ability of SUSI to provide for vulnerable students and families.'\n\nHe went on to criticise Minister Quinn's handling of the subsequent grant delays, asserting that the Department of Education 'was initially quick to blame students and parents for the delays' and that\u00a0'there is now an onus on the Minister to rectify the damage caused by ensuring that failings on this scale never occur again.'\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "16321", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "16317", "Heading": "USI criticises Quinn following publication of SUSI report"}
