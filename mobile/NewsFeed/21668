It is in\u00a0education and training.\"</blockquote>\r\nThe Labour leader had insisted the reason for reducing the dole for young people was to\u00a0encourage them to take up education and training for jobs rather than relying on benefits for\u00a0prolonged periods of time.\r\n\r\n\"The place for any young person is not permanently in front of a flatscreen TV. It is in\u00a0education and training,\" McCool said.\r\n\r\nGilmore made the misjudged remarks in response to opposition criticism of Labour TD for Dublin\u00a0South West Eamonn Maloney, who said in <em>The Irish Independent</em> that parents in his constituency\u00a0did not want their children at home watching a flat-screen television seven days a week.\r\n\r\nReacting to the comments, McCool, a recent DCU graduate, said: &ldquo;Young people have been\u00a0specifically targeted in the budget and are being scapegoated with the Labour Party using\u00a0language reminiscent of the British Tory Party&rsquo;s &lsquo;get on your bike&rsquo; posturing while at the\u00a0same time they pay lip service to job creation and have presided over a mass exodus of\u00a0young people who, far from being lazy have in fact travelled across the world in search of\u00a0work.&rdquo;\r\n<blockquote class=\"keepleft\">\"[Labour] have presided over a mass exodus of\u00a0young people who, far from being lazy have in fact travelled across the world in search of\u00a0work.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\nFellow Local Election Candidate for the United Left, Ken Doyle, also spoke at the public\u00a0meeting, describing the T\u00e1naiste&rsquo;s comments as a &ldquo;clumsy attempt&rdquo; to &ldquo;paint a picture of\u00a0lazy youth so that he could justify his support for welfare cuts.\"", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/T\u00e1naiste-Head-and-Shoulders-on-Plinth.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21668", "Heading": "T\u00e1naiste's Remarks Prompt Angry Response From Local Election Candidate"}
