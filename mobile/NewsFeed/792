A worst case and best case scenario were outlined which ranged from a 20% to 10% cut in the government allocation (core grant plus free fees allocation) resulting in a cut in money terms ranging from &euro;20m (worst case) to &euro;10m (best case) by 2013 over the 2010 level. If allowance is made for an expected downturn in research income and its contribution to overhead costs, and the additional costs that must be factored in for new space are taken into account, the funding available to the College will decrease by a further &euro;10m. Either scenario represents an enormous problem and one that cannot be managed without drastic and far-reaching action.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; \"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; \"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">There is one very positive point in our favour.
