{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Finn Keyes</strong> | \u00a0Current Affairs Editor</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thursday night saw the GMB chamber play host to the marriage of two unlikely societies, the Phil and the Free Legal Advice Centre. However the motion, &lsquo;This House Believes That the Death Penalty Has No Place in the Rule of Law&rsquo; , made the aptness of the union clear given the obvious philosophical considerations of the relative worth of life on the one hand and the social justice concerns which are at the heart of everything FLAC does.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The debate was chaired by the head of the Irish Innocence Project, barrister David Langwallner and speakers included such luminaries as our very own Prof. Ivana Bacik, the head of FLAC Noeline Blackwell and for the opposition Alan Harvey, the head of London Swinton Circle, a British right wing pressure group. The guest speakers were to have varying levels of impact in advocating the position of their team, from the essentially debate winning performance of Senator Bacik to the disastrous speech of Mr. Harvey.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The debate was opened by student speaker Conor Crummey who from the outset refused to be drawn into any unsavory analysis as to the cost of life sentences or the fraught empirical analysis of the actual deterrent effect of the sentence but rather took a position from the outset that the death penalty was wrong whether it &ldquo;works&rdquo; or not.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Opposition was then opened by Alan Harvey and it was a blow from which it would not recover. While he began with the relatively sensible proposal that the penalty be reserved for those offences that are so heinous that society must make an &ldquo;unequivocal statement&rdquo; that such offences are unacceptable. \u00a0Then in the second half of the debate he recounted at length the case of Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi scientist executed by Israel in the 1960&rsquo;s, asking the House how we could countenance his continued life before he came promptly to the conclusion that a support of the motion was a support of the Nazi holocaust. He made his way back to his seat into the face of a gale of laughter from the audience.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The debate thereafter was of inconsistent quality. There was clearly some confusion amongst the speakers as to just what the rule of law meant as well as failure to tackle the debate on principle, with an over-emphasis on how the sentence is at present applied inconsistently and in a racist fashion in the United States. As a speaker of the opposition pithily pointed out &ldquo;You can use the U.S. to prove or disprove just about anything&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The debate was wrapped up and won by the final speaker for the proposition Ivana Bacik. She summed up the arguments of the proposition in an illuminating fashion and spoke passionately about Irish people who have been executed by the Irish State and stressed the &ldquo;irreversible&rdquo; nature of the penalty. Quoting a fellow academic, she described the death penalty as &ldquo;the war of a whole nation against a person&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The motion was passed with only Mr. Harvey dissenting in the House.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/phil-and-flac.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21043", "Heading": "The Phil and FLAC Debate the Death Penalty"}
