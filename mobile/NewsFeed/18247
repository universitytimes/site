I had been invited by students at the Philosophical Society in order speak on the motion: This House Believes That Immigration Has Gone Too Far.\nUnfortunately last Thursday night a mob of around thirty far-left activists caused a disturbance on campus, intimidating and threatening students to such a degree that the proposed debate was cancelled on safety grounds. Members of the Philosophical Society were left shaken and in no doubt that physical violence would meet any attempt to hold their debate with the further threat of additional violent protestors being imported from Northern Ireland.\nIt is my understanding that students and college staff alike have been left so terrorised and intimidated by these recent events that they are too scared even to put in complaints to the police. In Irish law, blackmail, harassment and certain organised levels of intimidation constitute criminal offences.\nI hope that you will agree, whatever your own political persuasion, that such a shocking and flagrant attack on free speech on the oldest student society in the world cannot be allowed to succeed. Consequently, as an Honorary Patron charged \u00a0with \u00a0\"protecting the Society and using their good names to ensure its continued survival\", I am appealing to you to intervene.\nSuch an attack on free speech is an affront to our democratic values and a particular wrong against the Irish people themselves. \u00a0A proud and independent nation cannot be allowed to be subjugated by the extreme left to such an extent that it is effectively denied the opportunity to even discuss its own identity.\nThis matter has moved beyond the realm of party politics to become a matter of fundamental principles of free speech, democracy and self-determination. I therefore trust that you will raise this issue with the Philosophical Society as a matter of urgency.Yours sincerely\nNick Griffin MEP</div>\n<div>CC:\nAL PACINO\nBERTIE AHERN\nDAME HELEN MIRREN\nTHE EDGE\nFRAN\u00c7OISE BOURGUIGNON\nLORD MARK MALLOCH BROWN\nGABRIEL BYRNE\nMOHAMED ELBARADEIi\nNIALL FERGUSON\nNEWT GINGRICH\nRUTH BADER GINSBERG\nJOHN HUME\nFW DE KLERK\nSENATOR JOHN MCCAIN\nJOSEPH NYE\nGEORGE RITZER\nSIR SALMAN RUSHDIE\nEDWARD SAID\nOLIVER STONE\nARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU</div></blockquote>", "Imageurl": "5459", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18247", "Heading": "Nick Griffin&#039;s letter to Phil patron Sir Bob Geldof, asking him to intervene on his behalf"}
