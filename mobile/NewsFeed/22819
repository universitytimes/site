{"Body": "<p><strong>Hannah Ryan\u00a0</strong>| News Editor</p>\n<p>The Higher Education Authority (HEA) has introduced a new system for assessing the performance of Irish universities.</p>\n<p>The system, published on Saturday, aims to &ldquo;support high-quality strategic planning&rdquo;, according to lead author Muiris O&rsquo;Connor. &ldquo;We felt that the best way to achieve the appropriate balance between institutional autonomy and accountability was to focus on the transparency of performance throughout the third-level education system.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Thus the intent of the system is less to rank Irish institutions than to evaluate their performance individually; Mr O&rsquo;Connor further stated that most existing ranking systems lack a strong evidential base.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One of the main limitations of global university rankings is their strong reliance on reputational surveys,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Reputation is a proxy for quality, which is only very loosely correlated with high performance.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The new scheme gives each institution its own &ldquo;radar&rdquo; graph which shows how it compares to averages and best performances in 14 categories. These categories cover areas such as student/staff ratios, number of mature students, number of international students, number of student drop-outs between first and second year, number of PhDs per ten academic staff, etc.</p>\n<p>The figures are not weighted to take account of different sized student and staff cohorts, so direct comparisons are not necessarily useful. The data, taken from the 2010-11 academic year, will make it easier to pinpoint the strengths and weaknesses of each university, and will also aid the government in assessing the performance of institutions regarding their stated goals.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Institutions are free to pursue their mission but have to uphold their accountability,&rdquo; Mr O&rsquo;Connor said. &ldquo;We have diversity [at third level] and we want to build on the diversity in the system.&rdquo;</p>\n", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/trinitay.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22819", "Heading": "HEA Introduces New Method of Assessing Irish Universities"}
