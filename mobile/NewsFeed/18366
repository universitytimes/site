{"Body": "<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">A reduction in the income limits that determine the eligibility of students who receive the maintenance grant has left 800 second year students cut from the Student Grant Scheme. Many students are also now being offered the grant at a lower rate, in particular those who were previously receiving the largest grant rate available.</span>\r\n\r\nThe figures for other college years are yet to be released, but many of these students will also be affected.\r\n\r\nThis year the eligible income thresholds are reported to have been reduced by 3% from last year. Previously about 90,000 students received the grant.\r\n\r\nThe centralised body that awards grants in Ireland, Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI), have announced that they are on schedule with processing the applications for this year after last year&rsquo;s controversy of delays and errors.\r\n\r\nThe Union of Students in Ireland (USI) have warned that students are &ldquo;ready and equipped&rdquo; to fight cuts, urging students to oppose rising costs by voicing protest in their constituency offices and when voting as part of the &lsquo;Fight For Your Future&rsquo; campaign.\r\n\r\nThese cuts have come about as a result of last year&rsquo;s budget; further fears for the future of the grant have arisen as Minister for Education Ruairi Quinn is reported to have to make cuts of up to &euro;106 million in his department this October.\r\n\r\nUSI President Joe O&rsquo;Connor has expressed anger at the cuts, emphasizing how they directly affect the most vulnerable students in the country.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photobreakingnews.ie_.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18366", "Heading": "800 Students Already Targeted By Grant Cuts"}
