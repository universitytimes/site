{"Body": "<p>The mid-term review of restructuring, initiated in January of 2010, has recommended fundamental changes to the new structures in the wake of negative survey results from academics and a string of problems and inefficiencies uncovered by the reviewing team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">The team comprised two reviewers, Dr. Luc Weber of the University of Geneva and Dr. Sybille Reichart of North-Rhine Westphalia. The aim of the review was to &ldquo;consider the effectiveness&rdquo; of the restructuring measures in &ldquo;devolution arrangements for decision-making&rdquo;, improving College&rsquo;s &ldquo;communication structures&rdquo; and implementing &ldquo;new administrative roles at School and Faculty level&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">The recommended alterations were widespread and significant. The Faculty structure was criticised. College had originally planned to remove all Faculties in favour of a better School structure. Under pressure from particularly strong Faculties, College reneged and instead decided to streamline the Faculty structure. Failure to do remove this completely was criticised as it was seen as creating unnecessary complications and bureaucracies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">This pattern of complicated administrative structures also continued in the area of Departments. Professor Reichart found in her research that an unintended hybrid arrangement existed in certain cases where departments remained as budget holders even though School structures were in place. All of this led to a &ldquo;duplication of administrative duties at School and Faculty level&rdquo;.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Failure was also noted in the strategic objective of creating a clearer connection between academic decision-making in Schools and the rest of the College. It was recommended that, in the next phase of the restructuring process, it should be established that the link between the Executive of College and the rest should be the Heads of Schools.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Although not in the direct remit of the team, they also considered the College&rsquo;s proposed new Academic Resource Allocation Model (ARAM). Now defunct, ARAM was an attempt to make the distribution of funds between Schools more transparent and rational. Using a weighting system it sought to incentivise certain desirable attributes, for example giving extra points to PhD students as against undergraduates.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Championed by Dr O&rsquo;Hagan, who was also on the Steering Group which conducted the ill-fated academic survey, its apparent rational basis in seeking to reform an out-dated system was undermined by flaws and disagreements in the weighting system. In one example, arts and humanities disciplines were left dissatisfied by what they saw as a structural disadvantage placed on them by their comparatively low number of PhD students. In order to address this, College drastically lowered the points score of these students, thus angering disciplines who had sought to radically increase their pool of PhD students in order to gain resources.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">An additional problem was with the fixed nature of the government grant. In theory, even if all areas of the College improved by the guidelines, someone would still have to lose out. &ldquo;Undue emphasis&rdquo; on the impact of this system, which has now been replaced by a new one, was also criticised in the mid-term Report.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">An issue that caused some disagreement was that of the interdisciplinarity of the School structures. The Report recommended that all Schools be made interdisciplinary. This was the original intent of the restructuring but was met by fierce resistance by some strong disciplines like Physics, Chemistry and English, who were permitted to remain as single-discipline Schools.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">The multi-disciplinarity of Schools is seen as an asset in attaining lucrative grants, particularly those from the European Union. The fact that the reviewers seemed to come into the process with a pre-conceived theory in support of this was, however, questioned at the Board Meetings where the Report was presented, on June 30th and July 2nd this year.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">The final significant suggestion of the Report was that the role of the Provost and vice-Provost be more clearly defined. The vice-Provost in particular looks set to have his role reduced, essentially to academic affairs in the mould of the old Senior Lecturer position.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Financial concerns about this process were also raised at the board meeting. One board member was unable to support the new recommendations because he did not feel that they offered value for money. It was noted generally that the reviewing team were not asked to consider the economic context in which the College operated.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">This is particularly significant when one considers that a dismantling of structures put in place just in the last two years at a significant cost will probably not play well with the government in the run up to the next Budget. However, the board agreed that the current structure was not sustainable and they were supported in this by the Students&rsquo; Union.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">College has established a Task Force to implement the changes supported in the Report. This Task Force will consist of Profs. David Singleton and John McGilp and two Heads of Schools; one from a single-disciplinary one and the other from a multi-disciplinary one. It was agreed that these changes should be deliberated over carefully, given current circumstances, and not implemented urgently as the Report suggested.</span></p>", "Imageurl": "<p>The mid-term review of restructuring, initiated in January of 2010, has recommended fundamental changes to the new structures in the wake of negative survey results from academics and a string of problems and inefficiencies uncovered by the reviewing team.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">The team comprised two reviewers, Dr. Luc Weber of the University of Geneva and Dr. Sybille Reichart of North-Rhine Westphalia.
