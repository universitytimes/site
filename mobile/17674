Student residences have been reaching near-capacity since June.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"This serious shortfall is leaving many vulnerable students, many of whom are new to Dublin and Ireland, feeling stranded.\"</p>\n<em>The Students' Union accommodation advisory service is found in the Students' Union office in House 6.
