You&rsquo;re best off sticking with reputable brands, such as Apple, Dell, HP or Sony, as they tend to have good support and warranties.

To make this decision, you have to know what you&rsquo;re going to use the laptop for.

These days 2 GB of memory is pretty much standard and is all you will really need unless you do a lot of work with graphic design, video editing or publication production. As for the hard drive, most laptops come with 160 GB by default. This will be more than enough for most people, unless you want to keep a lot of music, photos or videos on your laptop, in which case you might consider paying for an upgrade to 250 or 320 GB.
