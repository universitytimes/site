The &lsquo;registration fee&rsquo; is being used by the government as a stealth tactic to increase fees by disguising it as a capitation charge. In the last 10 years the &lsquo;registration&rsquo; fee has increased by 1100 euro and if the intentions of the government in the next budget go ahead we will be paying up to 2500 euro.

Well apart from the SU managing to justify their existence, richer families are still benefiting more than poorer families and middle income families are losing out from a faulty grant system; it is actually rather astounding that since the abolition of fees was introduced in 1995 we have seen a 30% rise in 3rd level participation from lower income families when we still have an apartheid primary and secondary school system i.e. the two tier private and state system.</p>\n<p>This just shows what potential there is for an equitable education system if reform could take place.

The best way to do this is to tax the super wealthy and MNC&rsquo;s who benefit hugely from Ireland&rsquo;s tax laws and this can be used to provide a just 3rd level education system which would save the state millions in the future.</p>\n<p>So now that more people are believing that the fee issue is off the agenda and students whose families are well able to absorb the increase are apathetic to the cause, is a strong unified group of students now possible to stand up for a just education system?<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>Fees are off the table.
