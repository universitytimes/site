By the end of the week, however, any initial nerves were long forgotten, and it was with a calm confidence that our fencers travelled to Galway, eagerly awaiting their first match of the season.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, both women&rsquo;s sabre and foil were cancelled due to a lack of entries. As a consequence, men&rsquo;s \u00e9p\u00e9e took center stage on Saturday as the only event of that day. Despite being the only event, it provided plenty of interest, with three Trinity teams competing. It was the most experienced of the three Trinity teams, consisting of club captain Max Milner, club coach Colm Flynn, and club president Rory Greenan that impressively fenced its way into the final. DUFC1 faced the Pentathlon Ireland team in what was a thrilling final, which finished 37-45 to the pentathletes.\r\n\r\nSunday proved to be a much more lively affair with the remaining three weapons taking place. Men&rsquo;s Foil set the day&rsquo;s events in motion, and it was to be a second final in as many days for DUFC as our foilists faced off against Pembroke, having already faced each other earlier in the day. Despite some fine fencing, it was Pembroke who triumphed in the final.\r\n\r\nWomen&rsquo;s \u00e9p\u00e9e was the second event of the day. Having watched their male counterparts secure silver the day before, our lady \u00e9p\u00e9eists, led by DUFC ladies&rsquo; captain Emily Greenan, were determined not to be outdone. With this added impetus, they showed a determined resilience and for the third time that weekend, a DUFC team reached the final. Third time unlucky in a final, as our women&rsquo;s \u00e9p\u00e9e team was rewarded with silver medals, matching the result of their male clubmates from the previous day.\r\n\r\nLast but by no means least was men&rsquo;s sabre. Although the final event of a long day of fencing, the cheering and team spirit was as strong as ever among the team, and our supporters. With every point came a resounding roar, and our fencer&rsquo;s efforts were rewarded with a bronze medal.\r\n\r\nFour medals from four weapon classes was a great result from the first competition of the term. This is a strong platform to build on, and is a great start to what everyone will work hard to ensure is another resoundingly successful year for DUFC.\r\n\r\nDUFC Team National Teams and Results:\r\n\r\nMen&rsquo;s \u00c9p\u00e9e: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a02<sup>nd</sup> (Max Milner, Colm Flynn, Rory Greenan)\r\n\r\nWomen&rsquo;s \u00c9p\u00e9e: \u00a0 \u00a02<sup>nd</sup> (Emily Greenan, Camille Hindsgaul, Evie Clarke)\r\n\r\nMen&rsquo;s Foil: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 2<sup>nd </sup>(Max Milner, Killian Hanlon, David Byrne, Ross Byrne)\r\n\r\nMen&rsquo;s Sabre: \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3<sup>rd</sup> (David Barker, Luke Dowling, Fionn O&rsquo;Connor)", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/rsz_mens_foil_medals.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20183", "Heading": "Sterling Start for DUFC"}
