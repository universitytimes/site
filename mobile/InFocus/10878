However, I can see myself regaling\u00a0my grandchildren with stories about Euro 2012. How every day so far\u00a0has been like St Patrick's Day multiplied by football. How I've never\u00a0seen so many sunburned Paddies. And how a Paul Green volley from forty\u00a0yards in the dying minutes of the Spain match sent the world champions\u00a0packing.\n\nFor all the positivity however, disaster almost struck us before the\u00a0Croatia game. Three match tickets were grabbed from my uncle's hand\u00a0directly outside the stadium. Luckily, the swarms of green noticed our\u00a0desperate pursuit. Out of all the Paddies in Poznan, it was Paddy\u00a0Jackson who made himself a hero to our party. The stranger cornerned\u00a0the thief, giving my cousin time to take the tickets back (she also\u00a0threw in a punch to the face for good measure!).\n\nThe incident was indicative of the cameradery that has surrounded us\u00a0since leaving Dublin port. To quote Christy Moore, \"in Germany the\u00a0autobahn was like the long mile road.\" We hardly went ten minutes\u00a0without seeing a campervan decked out to the max. Even on the day of\u00a0the Germany game, there was a heavy green presence in Berlin.\n\nAfter our pitstop in the German capital, we embarked on the final leg\u00a0of our 2,000 km journey. The game itself was a bizarre, proud and\nultimately heart-breaking experience. A night of cheers, tears and\u00a0piss cheap beers. It is difficult to escape the disappointment of the\nresult but being here has made it far easier. My predominant memory of\u00a0the occasion will be the chorus of The Fields of Athenry at full time\u00a0that would have convinced a neutral that it was the boys in green who\u00a0came out on top. As I was reminded this morning, to progress, we\u00a0simply need to overcome the last two world champions. Piece of piss.\n\nChristy is unlikely to immortalise Se\u00e1n St Ledger in song as he did\u00a0with Ray Houghton but our equalising goal will stick with me as a very\u00a0special moment. Not since my days frequenting a certain teenage disco\u00a0in Donnybrook have I kissed so many strangers. Whatever about the\u00a0heartache, for 23 minutes in Poznan, we were in heaven.
