When Denmark and Netherlands face off in the Metalist Stadium in Kharkiv, they may do so in front of a half-absent audience. When Mario Balotelli proudly pulls on his country&rsquo;s jersey before stomping onto the turf in Poznan or Gdansk, he may be mere minutes away from hearing the racist chant of one drunken fool that causes him to stomp back off it (worries over such racism have caused England international Theo Walcott&rsquo;s family to stay at home). Lastly, Paul &lsquo;Unattached&rsquo; Green travels with the Ireland squad. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to believe that any football gets played between all the drama!\n\nWe&rsquo;ve heard of the extortionate prices being charged by hotels in the Ukraine, we&rsquo;ve all heard tell of the BBC Panorama documentary drawing attention to the possibility of racial hatred arising from the murkier depths of the host nations (judgment should be reserved &ndash; every country has idiots), and we&rsquo;re all well aware that Ireland&rsquo;s hopes of landing silverware stand firmly in the &lsquo;slim-to-none&rsquo; category. With all that being said, place your bets, get the beers in and tune in to Bill, Eamon and Gilesy &ndash; it&rsquo;s time for Euro 2012!\n\nNo football fan has any difficulty putting together a case for the defence when it comes to the Euros. For better or worse, this summer we bear witness to the latest instalment of the most magical tournament the football Gods have to offer us. Die-hards from Denmark, Ireland, Czech Republic and Sweden load up their caravans buoyed with the knowledge that footballing middle-weights such as Greece can take home the glorious title of European, as they did in 2004. The giants of Germany, France, Netherlands and Italy will beat their chests in hope, knowing that no previous winner (this time it&rsquo;s Spain) has ever retained the title.\u00a0\n\nAnd let&rsquo;s face the facts, the Spaniards have the very ample consolation of knowing their team contains enough quality to replace the Irish team two times over. Everyone goes to the Euros on a wing and a prayer at the very least, the history of age-old conflicts European conflicts we&rsquo;re all too young to actually remember somehow fresh in our minds. We&rsquo;ve not had spears or swords for a while now but once every four years, one of sixteen countries is given the chance to conquer Europe for itself.\n\nSo what is to be expected on the footballing front this year? The <em>tiki-taka</em> football of the Spanish side steamrolling their way to a third consecutive international trophy? The industry of Joachim Low&rsquo;s German team now complemented by the finesse and culture of players like Mesut Ozil, Sami Khedira and Lukas Podolski overwhelming their way back to glory? Or a victory for pragmatism in the form of Bert van Marwijk&rsquo;s Dutch outfit, outthinking and outmuscling their opponents with two ravenous strikers in the form of Robin Van Persie and Klass-Jan Huntelaar? Each feels as likely as the next this time around. That&rsquo;s to say nothing of the French underdogs, a team rebuilt by Laurent Blanc and very much fancying its chances to emerge unscathed from its group of England, Sweden and Ukraine.\n\nOne thing is certain &ndash; from Trappatoni&rsquo;s damn near impregnable Ireland to the low-ranked Poland whose team is actually peppered with Bundesliga and Ligue 1 winners, there will not be a single safe bet. That in mind, <em>The University Times</em> has had a good go at predicting some of the tournament&rsquo;s best and worst, as well as our own chances.\n\n<strong>Winner: Germany</strong>\n\nWhen picking a winner, it is very difficult to look past the holy triumvirate of Spain, Germany and The Netherlands. I personally think Holland are too weak in defence, and Van Bommell and De Jong are not the same players they were two years ago. Similarly, Spain&rsquo;s Barcelona contingent seems a little jaded. Although the Spanish boast as many as five players that can be considered the best in the world in their position, the speedy, dynamic and youthful Germans seem destined for greatness. Add hunger for a first contemporary trophy to the mix and the Germans seem slight favourites.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Dark Horses: France</strong>\n\nAlthough the French are traditionally strong contenders, they have gone largely under the radar in the build-up to this tournament, due to a variety of reasons. These range from their disastrous, mutinous World Cup display in South Africa, to their lack of a genuinely iconic player in the mould of Henry or Zidane. Nonetheless, the rebuilding of the nation by Laurent Blanc has shown some promise for this competition. Provided Lloris, Benzema, Nasri and Ribery can provide a touch of class and strong leadership, there are enough emerging players in this French squad capable of causing a lot of damage to opposition teams, and emerge from their group without much ado. However, although they show promise, they may leak goals. Reveillere, Mexes and Koscielny do not seem a solid enough platform from which France can launch a title winning campaign.\n\n<strong>One to Watch: Bastian Schweinsteiger</strong>\n\nGoals are glamorous and goals win games, therefore goalscorers are important fulcrums around which teams build a winning formula. Van Persie, Rooney and Ronaldo are obvious examples and talismans for their respective countries, as is Ibrahimovic. However, the midfield is the engine room and there is no more efficient engineer than Schweinsteiger. Having played a crucial role in Bayern&rsquo;s Champions&rsquo; League campaign, the German is in fantastic form. Although he missed a key penalty against Chelsea, the Munich man has nerves of steel and seemingly limitless lungs. His passing, tackling and awareness of space will make him a standout player in Poland and Ukraine.\n\n<strong>Top Scorer: Mario Gomez</strong>\n\nExpect big contributions from Lewandowski, Van Persie, Benzema and even perhaps Ronaldo. Spain&rsquo;s set-up and style of play suggests they will have a variety of players popping up in goalscoring positions. However, Gomez could just take the Golden Boot, solely because his awareness and intuition allow him to clean up a remarkable number of rebounds, in much the same style as Van Nistelrooy. Do not expect scintillating runs or extravagant efforts from the big German, just simple, clinical finishing.\n\n<strong>Best Young Player: Luuk De Jong</strong>\n\nAs much as I would like to mention McClean in this category, I just don&rsquo;t see him shining. For a young player to really thrive in a tournament like this, it is usually necessary that he has a strong team around him. Poland&rsquo;s Lewandowski and France&rsquo;s M&rsquo;Vila have bright futures without doubt, and a frightening number of the German squad can be considered in this category. Balotelli seems too volatile and has too negative a relationship with the Italian public to truly fulfil his potential this summer. In my opinion, if he gets game time, Holland&rsquo;s Luuk De Jong could surprise many people. He is aggressive, adventurous, skilful and supremely confident. Off the bench, he can ignite games and stretch tired defences, as evidenced by his efforts in the Dutch league this season.\n\n<strong>Tournament Flop: England</strong>\n\nAlthough the newly-scandalized Italians could push them close, an English collapse in big tournaments has become almost obligatory in recent years. Couple this with key absences and a ridiculous proportion of Liverpool players, six of the twenty-three Englishmen are selected from the currently hapless Reds, and we have a recipe for disaster. Although Hart will be heroic, the absence of Rooney against France and Sweden leaves Hodgson&rsquo;s decimated squad looking very exposed. Although they should claw their way out of the group, this might not be a tournament to remember for the Three Lions.\n\n<strong>Player of Tournament: Sergio Ramos</strong>\n\nNot an easy one. Although up until now I have largely focused on strikers and attacking players, recent trends in major tournaments suggest that defensive players might rule the roost once more. Having already mentioned Schweinsteiger, Sergio Ramos&rsquo; performances will definitely have a large impact on his country&rsquo;s fortunes. Penalty gaffes aside, he is coming into the competition off the back of a spectacularly successful season with Madrid, emerging as a world class centre-back in the process. If he forms a solid partnership with Pique, Spain&rsquo;s attacking talents will make them almost impossible to beat. If he loses concentration or drifts up field too much, Carlos Puyol&rsquo;s absence will be lamented perhaps even in the Bernabeu.\n\n<strong>Ireland&rsquo;s Chances: 3rd in Group</strong>\n\nWill we win it? No. Will we play good football? No. Will we be difficult to play, well organised and defensively equipped? Yes, yes, yes. The most pressing question is; will we be clinical? If Keane and Co. take their rare opportunities, we can upset the likes of Italy and Croatia, although a result against the Spanish is unlikely at best. A shock quarter-final would be cherished for years, anything further than that would be miraculous. Prediction: A gutsy, gritty, guarded group performance from the guys in green that just falls short. Just.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>", "Imageurl": "10754", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10753", "Heading": "Euro 2012: Preview"}
