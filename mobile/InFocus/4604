Three of these came from Adam Ashley-Cooper in sport's best six-minute period since a night in Istanbul in 2005.\n\nThe Wallabies began nervously, with Quade Cooper twice fumbling to suggest that his post-Ireland hangover was yet to be expelled.\n\nHe soon made amends in some slight measure for an apathetic showing last weekend, jinking past some lazy tackles to give impetus to the move finished off by Horne. Elsom added the second after a stylish step inside to beat the last man.\n\nWhile the omens at this early stage were not good for the Eagles, they exerted themselves to apply five minutes of constant pressure. Gagiano scored in the corner having evaded Elsom following a comprehensive scrummaging triumph for the men in white.\n\nThe shock was not allowed to fester as the Wallabies sought to restore the game's status quo. Beale and Fainga'a scored tries from the opposing ends of the back-play spectrum, Beale finishing off a length-of-the-field team effort before Fainga'a crashed over by the force of his own body mass.\n\nStade Francais second-row and Philosophy and Political Science graduate Lavalla had a quiet game in his first international start, but by all accounts he has adapted well to the transition from College Park to Eden Park.\n\nThe tries kept on coming in a second half played almost exclusively on US territory. Drew Mitchell forced his way over before Ashley-Cooper's quick-fire hat-trick took brought up Australia's half-century of points. Fainga'a and bulldozing number eight Radike Samo finished off what was more certainly a rout.", "Imageurl": "4605", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4604", "Heading": "Lavalla starts for fallen Eagles"}
