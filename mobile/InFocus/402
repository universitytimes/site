Not to mention the start up grant of 11million euro awarded by the HEA in 2007. In accord with laws of economic gravity, a number of annual scholarships are dispensed under the auspices of the TLRH &ndash; the worth of allocated funding in 2008 was 70,000 euro and in 2009 89,000euro.

In practice such an aim finds itself manifest in series of keynote talks sponsored by TLRH. These talks recently included such delightful topics as: &ldquo;Irish sexual taboos (or lack thereof)&rdquo;, &ldquo;The role and mission of the Humanities&rdquo; and &ldquo;Freedom of information, Freedom of inquiry&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The variety of the topics is vast and indicative of a healthy catholicity of interests, and, such a variety can only be overseen by an institute such as the TLRH. The field of information is too vast for the review and assessment of an individual. As such the TLRH includes representatives from seven academic schools, namely: The School of Drama, Film and Music, the School of English, the School of Histories and Humanities, the School of Languages, Literatures and Cultural Studies, the School of Linguistic, Speech and Communication Sciences, the School of Religions, Theology and Ecumenics, and the School of Social Sciences and Philosophy.</p>\n<p>It is a truism that the humanities must incorporate more than one perspective, but what determines how many perspectives the Humanities require? It seems odd that no mention of business, law or the hard sciences features among the list above. Commitment to truth and knowledge necessarily eschews too narrow a perspective, and it cannot be true that the omitted disciplines lack the concept human. The view that humans are a resource to be poke and prodded from cubicle to photocopier is a dominant world view and refusal to acknowledge this often renders us poorer for it.</p>\n<p>While the notion of objectivity in the humanities is often doubtful, the object of investigation is not. Either the human condition has a degree of fixity or it does not. If there is no fixity to the human condition then the TLRH &ldquo;explores&rdquo; nothing in particular. If there is then there are topics that can miss the mark, and the regulation of such ought to be subject to arbitration. Therefore, given their tag-line the TLRH has surely committed itself to the task of curtailing the perpetuation of ad hoc characterisations of the human condition while endorsing those of worth.</p>\n<p>The worry is that the conferring of legitimacy should not occur in advance of investigation, and if the lines which delineate the investigation of humanity are too finely drawn a legitimate inquiry may be ignored because of its failure to accord with the standard.
