Those who seem to always be posting on your class' Facebook group explaining that they couldn't make that 9am lecture because they were busy saving kittens from drowning but would really appreciate if someone could send them notes. Those people who never seem to return the favour, who always take but never give. Note leeches, ladies and gentlemen, a pest that is far too common in Trinity. They prey on the nerds, the people eager to make friends and those who are simply too nice to say no. They suck them dry for notes with little in return but a meagre \"Thanks x\" comment below.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now some might say I'm exaggerating the plight of the note leech but I fully believe it is a nuisance that has only grown in stature during my time in college. Why should one person's hard work be passed on to those who, in essence, simply weren't bothered? Should we allow these leeches to merely float along, surviving on the harvest of others? Or should they be left by their classmates to fend for themselves and maybe, god forbid, actually attend a few of those horrific 9ams? If the rest of us are going to struggle through the Baltic November morning bus journeys through town for a mundane lecture, we should at least be able to draw solace from the fact that everybody else is doing the same and are not in fact wrapped up snugly in bed, shielded from the winter blues.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">A leech will simply reap the benefits of one source and when it has sucked that dry, move on to the next callously</blockquote>\r\nDon't be confused into thinking I am completely hostile to note-sharing; far from it. I, in similar fashion to the majority of students, have received notes from friends and classmates alike. And I had no problem doing so for two main reasons which thankfully distinguish me from note leeches. Firstly, they know I will reciprocate their goodwill if asked. And secondly, I am not asking for the spoils of their hard work for every lecture and area of the course. A leech will simply reap the benefits of one source and when it has sucked that dry, move on to the next callously.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is a typical case of free riding. Why should I bother to take notes, or even attend lectures when there will always be some kind soul in the class who will gladly pass on their notes? There is no motivation to change their ways, no reason for them not to continue to carelessly take advantage of their more studious fellow classmates. The plague of note leeches can only come to an end if those who contribute the notes withhold them, forcing these leeches to fend for themselves and maybe, for once, write their own notes. I am not advocating a situation where notes are unique property, selfishly saved away on our own computers, never to be seen by eyes other than our own. Of course we should help \u00a0fellow students and sharing notes is a central aspect of this but it must be a two-way relationship. It is incredibly unfair for a certain select few to constantly and repeatedly take advantage of the more charitable members of the class.</p>\r\nA core aspect of this problem is that nobody wants to come off as mean or selfish and bluntly refuse to share their notes. However, why should they in some regards, be forced into making their own notes public by peer pressure? Why should they feel this sense of compulsion? In reality, they should not have to adopt the responsibility for others&rsquo; learning. We are all adults. We are past the stage where someone will swoop in and save you in every instance. These note leeches should not be able to justify their apathy with the fact that someone else will provide the notes for them, that someone else will do the work. If I have exerted the effort to reef myself out of bed on a blisteringly cold Friday morning to sit in a lecture theatre and scribble down furiously everything the lecturer says, why should someone else be rewarded? Surely it should be justifiable to say no, acceptable to refrain from supporting another&rsquo;s apathy.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive characteristic of a leech is that it feeds off its host for purely its own benefit, providing nothing in the relationship but irritancy. Sharing notes is not inherently a problem. It can be invaluable and extremely helpful. But like everything, it should not be taken for granted nor should it be abused by certain people. These leeches should not expect a constant flow of notes every time they post online. Thankfully, most people have no hesitancy in aiding others. In addition, most people grow frustrated from being continually asked by the same people who never appear to help any other pleas. No one will begrudge helping someone on the odd occasion or when they have a valid reason for their lack of notes. However, the leech does so regularly with no remorse. Note leeches should have their supply cut and left to support themselves, rather than rely on fellow students at every opportunity. Note sharing should be symbiotic and benefit both parties; there is no room for parasitic leeches.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/bigstock-Student-cheating-at-exam-look-40072537.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22783", "Heading": "Note Leeches, the Scourge of Classes"}
