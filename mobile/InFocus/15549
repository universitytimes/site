That&rsquo;s right - it&rsquo;s the end of winter and the beginning of spring, as celebrated by the triumphant tossing of rainbow-coloured powder amongst the revellers. Only this time, the white sky felt like the depth of midwinter, and the snowfall didn&rsquo;t tell much of a different story. Not ones to be repelled by a small dash of winter, however, the Indian Society went ahead with chutzpah, and Trinity students turned out in their droves to experience an Irish-infused slice of Indian culture.\n\nServesh, secretary of the Indian Society, tells me more. &ldquo;It was fantastic,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We had season changes from blizzard to sunshine to snow all in a period of twenty minutes, thanks to the Irish weather.&rdquo; For a festival that signifies the end of a dark winter and the beginning of spring, the snow came at a bit of an inopportune time, but, undeterred, students &ldquo;continued to have fun and thoroughly enjoyed splashing colours at each other, despite the freezing weather.&rdquo; Indeed, the blending of Irish unpredictability and traditional Indian culture made it feel &ldquo;as if a part of India was brought into Trinity,&rdquo; says Servesh, and therein lies the key to this successful society.\n\nLaunched as recently as 2009 by the Indian ambassador to Ireland, the Indian Society focuses on events that bring &ldquo;diversity to student life.&rdquo; In their four years on campus, they&rsquo;ve held Diwali (Festival of Lights) and Holi celebrations, movie screenings, food nights, and Henna sessions. They have provided Indian students with a &ldquo;home away from home,&rdquo; while inviting Irish students &ldquo;to share our lives.&rdquo; For any self-respecting cultural society, this is the aim, and the Indian Soc carry it off with aplomb, hosting events alone and with others (such as their collaboration with SUAS earlier in the year, to foster interest in both the culture of India and to give information on how students can get involved actively), and attracting all kinds of people to their festival celebrations. Servesh is keen to tell me that the Indian society has something for everyone. &ldquo;Our focus is to bring the best of India to Trinity,&rdquo; he says, and &ldquo;getting involved with the society is the best opportunity for students to experience the Indian culture.&rdquo; Events are laid-back and eclectic, and carry a heavy dose of cultural appeal. &ldquo;Our events primarily focus on Indian food, Henna, Indian movies,&rdquo; and, of course, the two big events of Holi and Diwali. They also have the occasional Bollywood dance class and language lessons. There really is something for everyone, and this year&rsquo;s celebration of colours gave people the impetus to get involved, as membership was offered for the rest of this year <em>and</em> next with a ticket to the Festival. They&rsquo;re keen on getting new members in, and have a reputation for being a friendly and open society who are willing to try new things, as well as introduce newbies to more ancient customs.\n\nBut what&rsquo;s the draw for the Festival of Colours, especially on a day like last Wednesday? Servesh says that from Holi people have &ldquo;colourful memories... that last a lifetime.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a unique and playful way to celebrate the coming of spring, even if the season doesn&rsquo;t quite seem to have hit our shores yet. Like the society itself, Holi is a festival that is &ldquo;unique,&rdquo; and shows students &ldquo;ways to have fun and enjoy themselves in a completely different environment.&rdquo; It is a festival of &ldquo;happiness and laughter,&rdquo; which is what Servesh credits its popularity to. That, and the fact that everybody wants to be covered in rainbow-bright powder at least once a year. When I ask him to summarise the Indian society in a sentence, he refers to it as the &ldquo;cherry&rdquo; on top of campus life. &ldquo;Not too big, but essential,&rdquo; and it tastes just right.\n\n<em>For more information on the Indian Society, and to keep up with their events, check out their <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/trindiansoc?fref=ts\">Facebook page.</a></em>", "Imageurl": "15556", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15549", "Heading": "Hello Spring: The Festival of Colours"}
