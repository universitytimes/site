Tomorrow the college campus that we know and love will be transformed into a\u00a0spectacle\u00a0of music and desire; that quiet girl who&rsquo;s been hiding out in the library for the past few months will be transformed into a beautiful swan and, let&rsquo;s be honest, what guy doesn&rsquo;t look well in a tux? Yes ladies and\u00a0gentlemen, The Trinity Ball is almost upon us, but with this frivolity,\u00a0gaiety\u00a0and utmost delight comes the looming\u00a0forecast\u00a0of rainfall and wind, not to mention tears and misfortune.\n\nSo how does one get through this infamous night? Whether it&rsquo;s your first time or whether you&rsquo;re a\u00a0seasoned\u00a0baller, you can always do with a few handy tips to help you along your way in the hopes of reappearing Saturday morning a little less worse for wear...\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip #1: Drink Smart, Not Hard</strong></span>\n\nWe&rsquo;ve all had that &ldquo;friend&rdquo; with the nightmare Trinity Ball story where they partied too hard at pre-drinks and to who the bright lights of Front Square were but a distant dream. Or the friend who got in the gates, only to have to be escorted home after only an hour due to the fact that they were &ldquo;<em>freeeeezing cold&rdquo;</em> but that you were to <em>&ldquo;stay and enjoy your night&rdquo;</em>. Or even worse still, the friend who wakes the next morning somewhere foreign, with no shoes, missing not only the battery to their phone but all memory of the previous night. So maybe keep it to the one naggin at pre drinks this year girls, who knows, you might even hear some of the music this time.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip #2: If you&rsquo;ve got It, Flaunt It...</strong></span>\n\n...or if you dont, pad it out and conceal your alcohol all in one easy step. Yes girls, it&rsquo;s the old <em>putting drink into zip-lock bags and sticking them in your bra in place of chicken fillets </em>trick. Having tried and tested this for two years running, I can guarantee its sucess. However, word to the wise,\u00a0quadruple\u00a0bag your drink, and be carful of sharp objects. Apart from that, you&rsquo;re onto a winner with this one; not only can you manage to sneak drink into the Ball past the friskers, but your cleavage is instantly more attractive to prospective suitors. Just make sure you offer them some of your smuggled drink in\u00a0lieu\u00a0of the dropped cup size later in the night!\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip#3: Bring Socks, Not Flats</strong></span>\n\nYou know those fluffy slipper socks you can get in Penney&rsquo;s for about &euro;3 for a pack of 3 pairs? They are your saviour. Firstly, they will fit into your bag easier than a pair of flats, secondly, they will give you more warmth at the end of the night than a pair of flats and finally, they are probably just as supportive as a pair of flats. Also, if you lose them, it&rsquo;s only a pair of socks.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip#4: Avoid the &ldquo;Ice Cream Cone&rdquo; Look</strong></span>\n\nYou know the one, at the end of the night, when your foundation has worn off, and suddenly your face is akin to Snow White&rsquo;s but your body is still glowing radioactive orange from your spray tan you spent so much on? Tan your faces girls! This means that even when your make-up wears off, you still look semi normal.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip #5: Leave the Make-Up at Home</strong></span>\n\nThere is nothing worse than girls taking up space at the port-a-loo sinks re-doing their make up. Remember that it&rsquo;s night time guys, that boy from BESS you&rsquo;ve fancied all year and are trying to get stuck into is not going to notice that your blusher is slightly less prominent than at the start of the night, nor does he care, in fact he probably thinks you&rsquo;re better looking with less make-up on. Do your make-up before you leave the house and then leave your face alone for the night and go have fun. Besides, how will that boy from BESS be able to check out your killer dance moves if you spend your whole night touching up your make-up in the toilet?\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip#6: Eat Dinner</strong></span>\n\nI know they say eating is cheating, but trust me on this one. Having a good big dinner will set you up for the night and have you still partying well into the early hours of Saturday morning. A glass of milk consumed before alcohol intake will also line the stomach. Oh, and if you&rsquo;re feeling tired or weak at the ball, more alcohol is not the answer, go for water, you&rsquo;re probably dehydrated from the aforementioned killer\u00a0dance-moves\u00a0you&rsquo;ve been pulling......... and I suppose all the alcohol might have something to do with it too.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip#7: There&rsquo;s no need for the Kitchen Sink</strong></span>\n\nOnly bring to the Ball what you do not mind losing at the Ball. Of course for the essentials like house keys, taxi money and feminine products, I suggest a cross body bag so you&rsquo;re free to forget about it and you don&rsquo;t run the risk of leaving it down somewhere and losing it. With regards to whether or not to bring your phone, yes they are very handy for when you&rsquo;ve lost your all your mates and are standing outside McDonald&rsquo;s at five in the morning calling them all, unless it&rsquo;s the phone you&rsquo;ve managed to lose that is, which brings me to my next tip...\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip#8: Organise a Meeting Place</strong></span>\n\nYou may be the type to never lose your phone, but your friends may not be. Be sure to organise a meeting place and a time and make sure that no man is left behind come sunrise. Oh and yeah, you will lose all your mates, but it&rsquo;s okay, you&rsquo;ll make lots of new ones.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip#9: The Tactical Chunder</strong></span>\n\nIf it&rsquo;s gotta be done, it&rsquo;s gotta be done. Just make sure you try make it to a bathroom, or at least behind a wall of sorts for some modesty, and make sure BESS boy doesn&rsquo;t see. Also, bring chewing gum.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Tip#10: Enjoy It!</strong></span>\n\nYes, you may end up freezing cold, having lost your phone, not to mention your mates, having had your toes trampled on by some wagon who decided to wear heels and are now left standing at 3am in the middle of Front Square alone and all hope may seem lost but just remember; in a week&rsquo;s time you&rsquo;ll be crossing that same square on the way to an exam while right now you&rsquo;re at Europe&rsquo;s largest private party surrounded by hundreds of people in Black Tie attire dancing to Fake Blood, so hike up that ball gown and go and bloody well enjoy the rest of your night, your friends are most likely doing the same thing, and plus, having lost all your mates gives you perfect reason to hang around with BESS boy. Who knows, it might well just become your very own fairytale ending.", "Imageurl": "10292", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10283", "Heading": "The Trinity Ball Survival Guide for Girls  "}
