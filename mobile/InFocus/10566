The project involves a significant proportion of staff of the Midnight promotions group, who run events in Alchemy and\u00a0Dandelion nightclubs on Monday and\u00a0Wednesday respectively. Former Dublin City University Student Greta Dunne - a member of the private Midnight Facebook group for staff - will serve as editor.\n\n&nbsp;\n<div><dl id=\"attachment_10506\"><dt><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=10506\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-10506\"><img title=\"Screen shot 2012-05-14 at 11.11.41\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-14-at-11.11.4114-300x144.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"144\" /></a></dt><dd>'The College Times' demo homepage</dd></dl></div>\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>The College Times,\u00a0</em>a project\u00a0that recognises the lack of a tabloid student newspaper in Ireland,\u00a0will be launched in the near future and boasts an Exsite-designed demo website. Existe is a Dublin-based web design company that also designed the Midnight website. The high level of recent activity suggests that the site is being primed for launch in the near future and a number of articles already accessible refer to the start of the summer period as a premise.\n\nIt includes sections on student news, sports, gig reviews,\u00a0travel, student classifieds, a 'Confession Book' forum in which users post details of minor transgressions, and a section entitled 'It's All About Sex', among others. A number of articles appear pseudonymously, with\u00a0Theta Omicron\u00a0frat leader Jack O'Connor offering advice on the execution of contraceptive application, anal sex, and the female orgasm in the latter section. O'Connor posted his finished articles in the\u00a0<em>College Times\u00a0</em>staff Facebook group but the online versions appear under the names\u00a0'Conor Jackson-Wild', 'Conor Jackson Wild', and 'Connor Jackson-Wild'. It is unclear if any of the site's other articles are written under pseudonyms.\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"><dl id=\"attachment_10544\" class=\"wp-caption \" style=\"width: 310px;\"><dt><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=10544\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-10544\"><img title=\"Screen shot 2012-05-14 at 11.12.30\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-14-at-11.12.303-300x138.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"138\" /></a></dt><dt></dt><dt></dt><dt></dt><dt></dt></dl></div>\nSuggestions that the project is being run by the Midnight group come from the involvement of a number of core Midnight staff - director Jamie White, Dan O'Brien, Orla Byrne, O'Connor, Rob Walsh, among many others - though the site's currently available content does not immediately suggest that the site will be used as a promotional tool for the brand. In total, the\u00a0College Times\u00a0staff group and the Midnight staff group - both private and exclusive - have sixteen members in common.\n\nThe site also advertises yet-to-be-launched Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube accounts, as well as an interactive poll gathering users' opinions on nightlife, sexual positions, and post-education life choices.\n<div>O'Connor and\u00a0Dunne declined to comment when approached by\u00a0<em>The University Times\u00a0</em>news editor Leanna Byrne this afternoon, save a declaration from the latter that the site would be up 'in\u00a0a few weeks'. Immediately after having been contacted by Byrne, the site administrators moved the site URL to its own domain separate from Exsite and content is no longer viewable.</div>\n<div>\u00a0</div>\n<div><em>Additional reporting by Leanna Byrne.</em></div>", "Imageurl": "10540", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10566", "Heading": "New national third level tabloid website set for launch"}
