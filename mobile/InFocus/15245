Children played, desperately making the most of the dwindling daylight. They dotted the roadside as we made our way to Gaza city, some passing balls, others practising against walls, or playing volleyball with makeshift nets. It is impossible not to notice the children of Gaza. What is even more striking is their positive and buoyant attitude in a place that&rsquo;s seen so much pain and destruction.</span>\n\nI was travelling with a group of nine other Irish people, all part of the recently established Gaza Action Ireland, which is aiming to build civil society links between Ireland and Gaza. It quickly became clear that perceptions about Gaza being home to innumerable bombed sites and destruction were not misplaced. But this narrative can often obscure the daily life and normal existence that continues alongside the adversity.\n\nThis attitude was clear to me in how Palestinians in Gaza continue to play sport despite huge obstacles. Israeli restrictions on the movement of teams and referees mean players are often prevented from travelling to attend training sessions. Players are routinely delayed and a star of the Palestinian team, Mahmoud Sarsak, was arrested while on his way to a training session in the West Bank. He was subsequently held without charge by Israeli authorities for three years. The organisation of tournaments or leagues is severely limited, and games largely take place on an ad-hoc basis. Up until 2010 soccer balls were just one of the many items banned from entering Gaza, and restrictions still apply for technical equipment such as digital screens needed for basketball. Almost 100 kilos of rugby gear and balls that had been kindly donated by my teammates in Leinster and Munster for the 2011 flotilla, still lies impounded in the Israeli port of Ashdod.\n\nThe Palestine soccer stadium has been bombed several times by Israel, most recently in the November assault on Gaza, leaving the outer structure of the stadium, which we saw, shattered. One club we visited, the Al Helal sporting club, had its windows blown out in the November bombing. The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) has documented how on separate occasions in recent months, bullets fired by Israeli soldiers stationed nearby, killed three children while they played football; 17 year old Ahmad Harara , his cousin, 16 year old Muhammad Harara, and 13 year old Muhammad Abu Daqa. The youngest was hit in the stomach, while wearing the jersey of his beloved Real Madrid.\n\nYet despite this, a passion for sport pervades. Any spare patch of ground, sand or track is quickly given over to spontaneous soccer or volleyball games. We watched an organized &lsquo;friendly&rsquo; between Al Helal and local rivals, Al Sadaqa, played on grounds located on what used to be the Israeli settlement of Nezarim. Al Helal plan a move to the Nezarim site, home to one of the few grass pitches in Gaza. We also visited a soccer school where kids from the age of 6 trained and practiced their dribbling skills in the shadow of buildings destroyed by the November bombings. Fadi Sultan, has just been picked for the Palestinian under 14 national team and he presented us with a small jersey of his club. I gave him one of my old Leinster jerseys, hoping that one day he will manage to fit into it.\n\nRugby is virtually unheard of here, but with the freedom to travel that every society should enjoy, I feel it is a game that could quickly develop. A number of Palestinian refugees - unable to return to Gaza because of the siege - have expressed a huge interest in rugby. In the meantime, we hope to invite an underage soccer team to a small tournament in Ireland that could help, in some small way, overcome the limits of the blockade.\n\nWe met with fishermen who told of how, as they seek to fish their waters, are harassed, beaten and shot by the Israeli navy. Despite visible scars and trauma they say they will continue to fish for their families and their people. We visited the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and Shifa Hospital where we were told about constant electricity blackouts and a shortage of radiology equipment because of the siege. They also detailed how ambulances can be targeted during Israeli attacks and how a lack of basic medicines has resulted in half of children under three in Gaza suffering from anaemia. Yet this fails to diminish the energy and determination of the staff and doctors. Dr Ghada Al Jadba, passionately describes their struggle against the blockade; &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want our people simply to survive, we want them to live.&rdquo;\n\nThis refusal to allow the siege dictate their lives was captured for me when I met 800-metre runner, Abdal Salam Al-Dabaji. There is not a single tartan track in Gaza, yet he managed to train on pot-holed sand tracks and qualify for the Athens Olympics. The 800 metre runner has no Olympic medals but provides a source of inspiration more profound than any trophy could offer. This is what it really means to struggle for your sport. The obstacles imposed on their lives by Israel will not define Abdal, the young soccer players, the young children or any of the people of Gaza. Their spirit will help them break these barriers in a place where they aim not just to survive, but to live.", "Imageurl": "15246", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15245", "Heading": "The unquenchable will for life"}
