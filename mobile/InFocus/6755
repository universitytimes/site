Ciaran Lyng, the Chair of the Labour society stated that the fact that the Labour Party may renege on its promise 'is an absolute disgrace and unfortunately it reinforces the justified\u00a0cynicism that people have about politics and politicians.'\n\nThe fact of the matter is that the Labour Party is the junior party in the coalition government, and therefore while Labour would prefer to focus on taxation it has to concede on certain points such as cutting current expenditure. 'Naturally Labour is going to have to compromise on certain matters including taxation.' Lyng pointed out, but he thinks 'that it is extraordinarily disappointing that\u00a0a Labour Minister is going to continue those regressive and unfair Fianna F\u00e1il policies in undermining the policy of universal free education.'\n\nThe letter essentially condemns the forecasted budgetary cuts and urges that TDs 'take serious account of our [the Labour Society&rsquo;s] warnings about the consequences which will flow from a broken promise of this kind.'", "Imageurl": "6756", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6755", "Heading": "Trinity Labour supporters voice opposition to party proposals"}
