Honestly I'm not sure but as far as my parents are concerned it was fairly instant and it certainly plays a part in my earliest memories. I was forever tearing apart my mam's wardrobe in search of my perfect \"gown\" (i.e. her night dresses) or her bottle of Chanel no.5 - which I would attempt to graciously dap on myself like the fabulously chic women in their mesmerizing ads. (Naturally I broke the bottle top instead!) Ogling through my mam's magazines led me to even put on little fashion shows. I was convinced that I was Naomi Campbell!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">When did you decide to turn your dreams into a reality and pursue a career in fashion?</span></b></div>\n<div>Transition year was a great opportunity for me to finally get to discover my passion. On a whim I called stylist Angela Scanlon after I found her mobile number on the internet and did a week long stint as her assistant. The week turned into over 2 years of experience, in which I assisted on a number of shoots, shows and with research for articles. Word soon got around about me as a little assistant and I've since assisted Alison Conneely, Roxanne Parker and Olly Patton of the Sunday Times Style, where I completed an internship in London this summer. Assisting also (oddly) led to a job as a model. Frequently being mistaken as the model on set, I was soon asked to do a few small jobs such as an Oxfam campaign and a shoot for the Sunday Independent. I'm now signed with Distinct Model Management, with the loveliest agent (Anne Morgan) a model could ask for, and am really a bit miffed as to how I got here at all! I definitely feel quite lucky as I never would have imagined as the mad spindly child that I was that I'd be juggling shows, shoots and castings between college and the odd assisting job!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Do you have any favourite blogs and who are your style icons?</span></strong></div>\n<div>Blog-wise you can't go wrong with the usual favorites - the Sartorialist, Jack and Jil, Stockholm Street Style. I also love checking out Afterdrk, JouJouVilleroy, Liam Saw This for some style inspiration. I love a blog with great pictures. Fashion is a very visual thing after all and killer photography can really make an outfit speak.</div>\n<div>In terms of style icons Audrey Hepburn is definitely someone I've been fascinated by for years. She's a true testament that modesty can be sexy and that simple is always chic. I also love Diane Kruger (rarely puts a foot wrong), the Olsen twins and a touch of that French tomboy nonchalance embodied so well by the likes of Charlotte Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin. I've never been too girly (Skirts are a rarity!) so there needs to be a little tough grungy aspect to the way I dress.</div>\n<div><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">\u00a0</span></b></div>\n<div><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Do you think there is a lot of pressure on models nowadays to have a certain \"look\"?</span></b></div>\n<div>The fashion industry has this funny view on what is \"the look\" du jour. It's constantly changing and varies widely from person to person. For example the Saint Laurent runway screamed heroin chic this PFW, while at Jean Paul Gaultier women of all shapes, ages and sizes were present. I know people who were rejected by agencies in London but were adored in Paris. It can't be denied, however, that size zero is something that's not going to go away. It's the standard and, internationally, if you don't fit it, you'll be made to fit it, no matter what that takes. It's a sad reality but thankfully it doesn't seem to exist in Ireland. Although we still have to stay slim and regularly have our measurements taken, a more healthy image is coveted.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What would your advice be to people looking to get involved in the industry?</span></strong></div>\n<div>Be willing to take any opportunity that comes your way - including unpaid internships. I've been interning for over 4 years and only received my first form of official payment (that only just about covered my travel costs!) this summer. Unfortunately that's the kind of industry this is and if you're not willing to do it, people won't really sympathise. You also have to be willing to work hard. Interning is not easy, there are long hours and the work can often be quite manual. I've carried many heavy bags of clothes in lashings of rain. You just have to remind yourself that this is the staring point. Everyone starts at the bottom and works their way to the top. But it's not all dismal. If you truly love the job and you really do want I work in fashion, you will have lots of fun along the way!</div>\n</div>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Trinitys-Young-and-Successful-SARAH-HASHISH-PIC-1.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20145", "Heading": "Passion for Fashion"}
