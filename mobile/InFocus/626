{"Body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ali Hassan al&ndash;Mujid, nicknamed Chemical Ali for ordering gas attacks on the Kurds during the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war, was hanged on the 25th January 2010. Following a lengthy trial he was sentenced to death four times for genocide and crimes against humanity.</p>\n<p>A paternal cousin of former President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, Chemical Ali rose to power with fellow Ba&rsquo;athist party members in the 1970s, becoming an aide to Iraqi Defence Minister, Hammadi Shihab.</p>\n<p>When Hussein became President in 1979, Al-Mujid became one of his closest military advisors and head of the Mukhabarat &ndash; the Iraqi secret police and the Intelligence Service. Al-Mujid is quoted as saying to Hussein when denouncing traitors;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;What you have done in the past is good. What you will do in the future is good. But there is one small point. You have been too gentle, too merciful.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 1983, Al-Mujid directed a punishment operation in Dujail, north of Baghdad, in which hundreds of local men were executed, thousands deported and the town destroyed, following an assassination attempt on Hussein&rsquo;s life.</p>\n<p>He served as Secretary-General of the Northern Bureau of the Ba&rsquo;ath Party between March 1987 and April 1989. In command of all state agencies in the predominantly Kurdish North of the country, he became known for his ruthlessness. His indiscriminate use of chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, sarin, tabun and VX, gave rise to the name Chemical Ali, of which he was known to have openly boasted about.

The brutal Halabja attacks was examined as part of his trial. Forces commanded by Al-Mujid embarked on a systematic campaign of death and destruction in his bid to crush the rebellious Kurdish population. A decree signed in 1987 stated;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Within their jurisdiction, the armed forces must kill any human being or animal present in these areas&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>By 1988 some 1.5 million Kurds had been deported, 4,000 villages destroyed and 180,000 people killed. Following the end of the conflict, al-Mujid was appointed Minister of Local Government with control over all of the region. He oversaw the settlement of Arabs relocated from other areas of Iraq.</p>\n<p>Following the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, he began a brutal campaign under which Kuwait was systematically looted, and purged of all &ldquo;disloyal elements&rdquo;. &nbsp;Al-Mujid was appointed Interior Minister of Iraq in March 1991.
