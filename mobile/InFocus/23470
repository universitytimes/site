{"Body": "<strong>Carla King-Molina </strong>| Contributing Writer\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">1. Mesh</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In general, mesh can be a fashion friend. But with the 90s revival of 2013, it was omnipresent on catwalks, on the high street and in our wardrobe&hellip; A major closet cleanse is needed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">2. \u00a0\u00a0Skorts</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This trend took 2013 by the scruff of the neck and was worn on at least one night out by a lot of people. However, it reminds one a little too much of playing hockey and getting hit in the face. Here&rsquo;s hoping the allure of the multi-tasking bottom will wear off this year.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">3. \u00a0\u00a0Luxury-Brand-Pun Tops</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Someone clearly realised a gap in the market for puns and high fashion and wouldn't let it go, someone called Urban Outfitters. Hopefully in 2014 our inner word-nerds will realise how mistaken we were and refuse to let us wear that Homi\u010ds t-shirt.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">4. \u00a0\u00a0Angora Jumpers</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the videos of rabbit farms in China hit the fashion world and the internet, slipping on the pink H&amp;M number became a bit of an uneasy affair. Given that after the video became viral Zara, H&amp;M, and Acne stopped angora production, it may prove one of the easier trends to quit.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">5. \u00a0\u00a0Tumblr-inspired outfits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We can't all be Katy Perry, who somehow managed to seamlessly rock a shimmery jersey, chunky boots and a tutu, but far too many still need this news broken gently to them.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">6. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Peplum</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Peplum has all the sex appeal of body con without showing problem areas, but its time has come. It has officially made the rounds of every possible clothing item: dresses, skirts, trousers, blouses etc... Saturation point reached.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">7. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crop Tops</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not since 1995 has so much midriff been shown! Crop tops were highly overused in 2013, with the 50 Shades type leather ones being particularly offensive.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8. Cutout Boots</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cutout fatigue has arrived. Maybe it&rsquo;s time we bring back boots that keep the cold out and leave our Topshop versions at home.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">9. Fur</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everything became just a bit too fuzzy last year. With the headbands, scarves, bags and collars 2013 could have been the most appropriate year yet for the Muppet movie to come out!</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">10. Animal Print</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Leopard, zebra, and cheetah print all need to die. Now, please. You may only wear things that once appeared alive in The Lion King if you auditioning for the part of a rival barmaid to Liz McDonald on Coronation Street.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/brian-lichtenberg-talks-about-the-homies-collection-and-his-thoughts-on-streetwear-4.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23470", "Heading": "Out With The Old: 10 Trend Regrets of 2013"}
