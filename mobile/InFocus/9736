After a little more research, though, I discovered that that the film is actually based on a novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs, first published in 1917. That&rsquo;s right, this novel, the first in a series, is actually a blueprint for most science-fiction novels and films that have come since. When viewed through this lens, it really becomes astonishing how far ahead of its time certain plot elements are &ndash; the feisty Dejah Thoris resembles Princess Leia of <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>, an execution scene in an arena is pretty much identical to the fight on Geonosis in <em>Star Wars: Attack of the Clones</em>, and the rich world with a huge backstory that fuels humour based on cultural differences was clearly an inspiration for <em>Avatar</em>. While this is all very interesting and thought-provoking, I am here to review the film, not the novel &ndash; was it worth waiting almost 100 years for the story to come to the big screen?\n\nThe answer is yes. While it&rsquo;s not the greatest film ever made, and it occasionally suffers from some pacing issues, <em>John Carter </em>succeeds as a fun action-adventure blockbuster, full of pulpy fun. In a way, I&rsquo;m kind of sad that films like this don&rsquo;t get made anymore (and probably won&rsquo;t be, considering how this one fared pretty badly at the box office). I would take &lsquo;sand-and-sandals&rsquo; epics over gritty superhero films any day. What elevates <em>John Carter</em> from your usual, run-of-the-mill adventures like 2002&rsquo;s fun but forgettable <em>The Scorpion King</em> is the rich backstory of Barsoom (the &lsquo;real&rsquo; name for Mars). You can witness wonderful attention to detail in every scene of the film, most evident in the middle section, when John meets the Tharks, a spartan-like race who have some very interesting cultural peculiarities. While all of this is not as detailed as in <em>Avatar</em>, it is still more intelligent than your average blockbuster &ndash; it also helps that you are not beaten over the head with exposition, making the fairly standard sci-fi tropes feel fresh and exciting.\n\nAction also succeeds, aided by a great retro-futuristic art direction. Despite occasional flaws with CGI, watching a guy swing a chain at some aliens, <em>God of War</em>-style, remains immensely satisfying. A sequence towards the end that I mentioned earlier, during which the heroes are pitted against enormous beasts, is fantastic, even though it is a little upstaged by a similar scene in <em>Attack of the Clones </em>(the only good scene in that <em>Star Wars </em>film). Vehicle design is also excellent, being a mixture of steampunk and sci-fi. I also greatly enjoyed a scene which takes place in some alien ruins, which conjures up memories of such action-adventure classics as <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>.\n\nThere are problems with the film, though &ndash; pacing slows drastically somewhere in the middle, which hurts the action a little. The protagonist&rsquo;s backstory seems a little tacked on, due to its constant appearance through flashbacks, and while it might have been expanded upon in the novel it falls flat in the film. Also, I felt that the main villain&rsquo;s intentions weren&rsquo;t explained clearly enough &ndash; perhaps this will be elaborated upon in the sequels, but as a stand-alone film, this kind of vagueness doesn&rsquo;t work.\n\nDespite the flaws, <em>John Carter</em> is a very good action film. It currently has a rating of 49% on Rotten Tomatoes, and while I can understand that this isn&rsquo;t an action-adventure classic, it definitely does not deserve such critical contempt. It sets out its goals quite clearly &ndash; to create a fantasy universe, within which we can have pulpy, cheesy fun &ndash; and it completes them with flying colours.", "Imageurl": "9178", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "9736", "Heading": "John Carter - Review"}
