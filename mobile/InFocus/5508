There is no one emotion you can pin to your very first week of college, and no one moment that defines it. There is however, a moment it all starts. My first day at Trinity. My first time to walk onto campus as a student. I have no shame in admitting that I was terrified. Excited? Yes. Scared? Absolutely.\u00a0 School had become so comfortable; I knew who everyone was, where everything was. I had my friends, my routine. I knew what I was doing. Here I knew nothing. There wasn&rsquo;t even a uniform. All certainties had flown out of that famed Front Arch.\n\nAs I tottered over the cobblestones in high heeled boots (rookie mistake) I was stunned. There were so many stands, so many people. I wandered cautiously into the fray. Leaflets, free food, eager smiles, enthusiastic pitches-you have to admire the dedication of society committees. If an arm was thrown around your unsuspecting shoulder to bring you to a stand, you were being offered lessons to throw someone over your own shoulder.\u00a0 Madness, but in the best sense of the word. It&rsquo;s incredible how many societies there are here and I wish I had time for them all.\n\nThen there was registration (why aren&rsquo;t you warned before the picture is taken?!) and I was issued with my shiny new student card and given my tour of the library. Course meetings, peer mentors and tutors-I was fully immersed in the Trinity experience and looking forward to starting lectures.\u00a0 With the academic side of things covered, I was off to sign up to some societies.\n\nI had never guessed was how tiring college would be. I only spent a few hours in Trinity each day, but I was exhausted. When some of my fellow firsties were out pub-crawling or silent-discoing I was resting at home, utterly shattered. Finding out where everything is, what&rsquo;s going on, travelling to college, meeting new people- it&rsquo;s an exhilarating experience that leaves you drained at the end of the day.\n\nInitially I found it all a bit overwhelming and crazy. But it was fun too! Day one was utter panic; I despaired of ever actually even talking to someone, let alone making a friend. By the end of the week I had talked to people from my course, navigated most of the campus, filled my wallet with membership cards, and amongst all those society arms around my shoulders, gained some comfort and maybe even found my way. Freshers' week made me feel welcome in a way no introductory lecture ever could. It's going to be a great year Trinity.
