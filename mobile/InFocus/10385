The horse was given a break after winning for Trinity in Navan before Christmas. The first horse ever owned by an Irish college society made it a remarkable two victories by winning the Irish Stallion Farms European Breeders Fund Hurdle.\n\nLocal Celebrity came home a neck in front of the very accomplished runner, His Excellency, which was the 5/2 second favorite, to win the &euro;8,970 first prize. Champion amateur, Patrick Mullins, bounced Local Celebrity out in front and stayed there for a gutsy victory after a protracted battle up the home straight with the late charging His Excellency.\n\nCommenting after the race, Patrick Mullins remarked &ldquo;He was tough and very brave over the last three hurdles. Hopefully that puts a pep in the step of everyone in Trinity during the exam period!&rdquo;\n\nThis victory places Local Celebrity as a horse on the up in Irish racing, with exciting plans already being made by the society's connections in a bid for a three in a row.", "Imageurl": "10386", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10385", "Heading": "Local Celebrity makes it two in a row at Sligo Racecourse"}
