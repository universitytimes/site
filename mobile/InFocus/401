{"Body": "<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you guys know there&rsquo;s never a dull moment in Dublin city, particularly when sitting in a street-side beer garden. Our banter was interrupted a fair few times by the stream of homeless people walking by, asking for a couple of euro to pay for a hostel. Mostly we obliged, never giving a second thought to how these people&rsquo;s lives became so desolate.</p>\n<p>Our perspective definitely changed after a (poignant) near-death experience. Just as I had returned from the bar with the next round, we were approached by a burly looking brick of a man who demanded money for a pint. I wasn&rsquo;t too enthused by his intimidation tactics, so we unconsciously went for the &lsquo;ignore him and he&rsquo;ll go away&rsquo; ploy. His dark eyes darted erratically around our small table. With no encouragement from us, he began to rant angrily about the unfairness of life.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;People&rsquo;ll always let you down, I don&rsquo;t cry over nobody &lsquo;cos who&rsquo;d cry over me, yeah?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>He rambled on and on while we sat tense and uncomfortable in our chairs. Clara, trying to lighten the atmosphere, agreed with him heartily. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead right!&rdquo;<br />He turned and gave her an intense stare, as if he was sure she was making fun of him. I could see his pride and his sensitivity to any perceived insult. Clara met his gaze, and I wondered how long it had been since another human being had made eye-contact with him.&nbsp; He continued speaking, still in his harsh angry tone.<br />&ldquo;&hellip;.it&rsquo;s nice to be nice, ya know?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what my dad always says!&rdquo; I piped up. I think I was so frightened that I was subtly trying to remind him that I had a family &ndash; as in people who would care if he did anything to hurt me. He turned to me and said, &ldquo;Does he?&rdquo; I saw the shock in his eyes as he seemed to mull over what I said.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;I have to show ye girls something&rdquo; he said. He began to grope inside his overcoat pocket. My friends and I looked at each other in panic. My immediate thought was &ldquo;gun&rdquo;. I froze to my chair. I learned that day that I don&rsquo;t react very well in pressure situations. My mind went blank and I couldn&rsquo;t move.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a gun.&rdquo; He smirked, reading my mind.</p>\n<p>I wasn&rsquo;t convinced but Hazel exhaled and smiled. &ldquo;Gosh I&rsquo;m disappointed!&rdquo; she joked.</p>\n<p>He leered at us and muttered &ldquo;We could all die together.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have to admit I thought I was going to die that day. This was a madman.</p>\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t expect what happened next. He pulled out a big bundle of paper and asked &ldquo;Will you read my poems?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Clara, still wary, told him she didn&rsquo;t like reading. Eventually Hazel consented to read his poem aloud. It was called &lsquo;The Sometime Man&rsquo;. I wish I could remember all the words to his poem. It was a description of all the pain he had suffered in his life. Of all the times he had &lsquo;nearly&rsquo; achieved his goals until his life led him down this miserable path. Yet there was hope in his poem.</p>\n<p>I thought to myself that if anything ever happens to him, all that will be found with him is his precious bundle of poems. &lsquo;Sometime&rsquo; he will achieve his dreams, even if he never lives to see his poems published. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that he isn&rsquo;t the most educated writer because his poetry is real.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll remember me&rdquo; he appealed to us as he was hustled out of the beer garden by our large hairy bar man.</p>\n<p>It just goes to show that everyone has a story to tell, something to offer, if only they decide to tell it.
