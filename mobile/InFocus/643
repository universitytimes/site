{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a hobby that elevates the mind as well as the eyes. Not only is stargazing cheap, but it is also fascinating and quite addictive.</p>\n<p>My personal interest for stargazing started when I first stumbled into a small planetarium in West Cork; Schull village boasts the only planetarium in the Republic and it&rsquo;s well worth a trip. Whether you are an astronomy genius or can barely recognize the famed &lsquo;Plough&rsquo; constellation, the planetarium&rsquo;s hemispherical dome, which accurately reproduces the night sky, leaves you with plenty of room for improvement. Star shows are available all year round, varying with seasonal demand. Confronted with astronomical time scales and distances, the visitor is inevitably reminded of his place in the universe. But even though the planetarium is a good start for the amateur stargazer, the sky outside is the real treat!</p>\n<p>Personally, when I first tried stargazing, all stars looked the same. If you feel just as awkward and can&rsquo;t remember if Pluto is still on the planet list (it&rsquo;s been downgraded to &ldquo;dwarf planet&rdquo; status, by the way!), the best advice is to choose a clear night and, warm blanket at hand, venture outside. Locating the Plough is a good start (it&rsquo;s always visible in the night sky). From there, the use of star-hopping charts can bring you to any and all the delights that the seasonal sky has to offer.</p>\n<p>It is surprising what the naked eye can see, but it all depends on the level of light pollution and transparency of the atmosphere. With a bit of experience and luck, you may be able to catch a glimpse of Andromeda, a galaxy 2.5 million light-years away and the only spiral galaxy clearly visible with the naked eye!</p>\n<p>February is a great month to start stargazing: on the 13th, the constellation of Orion the Hunter will be clearly visible and, on the 15th, Venus and Jupiter, the two brightest planets, will converge in a conjunction. Don&rsquo;t miss the chance to get a clear view of the asteroid 4 Vesta, on February 20th. If you&rsquo;re interested in astronomy, Ireland&rsquo;s National Astronomy Club organizes a series of lectures throughout Ireland (see www.astronomy.ie), as well as an annual trip to the Armagh Observatory.</p>\n<p>But, for beginners and experts alike, the constellations, with their names rooted in Greek mythology, are an endless source of fun in themselves. Have you seen vain Cassiopea, relegated to her seat in the heavens? Maybe the white, winged horse, Pegasus, will gallop towards you or the friendly dolphin Delphinus will playfully splash you. Only having accustomed yourself with these and other friends, should you consider looking through a telescope. The BBC magazine &ldquo;Sky at night&rdquo; suggests an intermediate instrument between eye and telescope: a pair of binoculars. In fact, they can show a wider view than a telescope and are perfect to learn your way around the sky.</p>\n<p>With Valentine&rsquo;s day coming up, what better way to impress a date than to boast your knowledge of the night sky? The Heart Nebula, shaped like the organ itself, is perhaps the most romantic nebula and it is visible towards the north all night.
