And his frustration is clearly still relevant today.\u00a0 As the abuse and exploitation of the church became too much for us, we started to slowly ease them from power. Unfortunately, we were not long finding an adequate replacement.\n\nWe once again live in a state outside our own control. With the help of the \u00e9lite in our society we have welcomed in the &lsquo;Troika&rsquo; and allowed them free reign to dismantle our welfare state, in order to protect the interests of those in ascendancy at home and abroad. Once again we find ourselves being exploited by our powerful neighbours - this time with austerity and economic bomb threats instead of guns and bayonets.\n\nWhat we are seeing is clear and obvious exploitation. Our government has forced us through 4 austerity budgets that target the most vulnerable in our society. Now we face into more years of brutal austerity. The ordinary people of our country are being squeezed to death in order to protect the domestic and international status quo. The politicians, bankers and big businesses, who benefited so richly from the &lsquo;Celtic Tiger economy&rsquo;, are shielded from most of the cuts. The obnoxious wealth accumulated by the \u00e9lite was not used to clean up the mess when the &lsquo;economy&rsquo; collapsed. Instead it is the working people, the taxpayers, the average citizens who are being punished for the greed of the economic aristocracy that caused this mess.\n\nSalaries of the public sector have already been cut by 20%. Hard-working nurses, teachers, public servants are being held responsible for a crisis not of their making. The most vulnerable in our society are being punished: welfare payments to the unemployed are steadily being reduced, students are seeing increasing fees, and now the pensions of our elderly are in the firing line. Almost 40,000 young people have been forced to emigrate because there are no jobs for us at home.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_7883\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"&quot;The Church justified their oppression with reference to the Bible - our oppressors today justify themselves with the unquestionable gospel of the free-market.&quot;\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=7883\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7883\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7883\" title=\"jesus-starbucks1\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/jesus-starbucks1-300x213.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"213\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nOur political establishment is happy to abide this - as long as the interests of the \u00e9lite are safeguarded. Retired politicians enjoy up to &euro;160,000 pensions for their &lsquo;service&rsquo; to the country. It is quite clear that the Irish political system is broken. Fianna F\u00e1il, draping itself in the flag of nationalist sentiment, was easily corrupted and it wasn&rsquo;t long after independence that it was running economic policy for a new dominant political class. Today Fine Gael and a Labour Party - who would make James Connolly turn in his grave - are the vanguard of the same neoliberal policy as their disgraced predecessors. Unfortunately, they are all part of the problem in this broken system.\n\nThe church justified their oppression with reference to the Bible - our oppressors today justify themselves with the unquestionable gospel of the free-market. The economy, we&rsquo;re told, is to be dealt with by the experts - too complicated for the public at large. But there&rsquo;s nothing complicated at all about what is happening. We are once again being oppressed and exploited by the powerful pursuing their interests, and it is up to us to resist it.\n\nInstead of welcoming emigration, we must oppose it. Instead of dismissing the protestors on Dame Street, we must join them. Instead of accepting our &lsquo;economic&rsquo; situation we must challenge it. Instead of surrendering to the \u00e9lite, we must confront them. We must act - this is the demand, the task, the duty of the Irish citizen today.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YFxoXI2JZbI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>", "Imageurl": "7877", "Thumb_nail": "http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Man-Ray-James-Joyce-1922", "ID": "7876", "Heading": "Portrait of a People"}
