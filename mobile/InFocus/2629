{"Body": "Caoimhe Kenny\n\nPicture the scene. July in Ireland. It&rsquo;s raining. \u00a0You&rsquo;re back home in a field in Roscommon and your mother&rsquo;s nagging you to bring out the bins/peel the potatoes/ insert inane household task here. Seven of your friends are living it up in San Diego, while you are jobless, broke and housebound. Time to make like a tree and leave.\n\n&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; I hear you cry, &ldquo;How am I to pull off this great escape with such limited funds?&rdquo; Never fear! Your guide to cheap and cheerful summer alternatives is here!\n<h3>Travel option No. 1: <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">CouchSurfing</span></h3>\nNot some bizarre form of extreme sport, as the name might suggest, but a free and easy way of finding accommodation abroad. You wish to stay in a foreign country without the expense of a hostel and some kind individual provides you with their couch/bed/floor. Voila! Travel on the cheap. The idea originated in 1999 when a Bostonian named Casey Fenton found a cheap flight to Iceland and randomly emailed 1500 students asking if he could stay. He received over 50 replies in the affirmative. The realisation that a complete stranger would be willing to provide travellers with a place to stay inspired Fenton to begin the CouchSurfing project. The project works as a kind of social networking database, it is free to register and members can upload pictures and information about themselves before searching for potential hosts. Guests and hosts ideally exchange as much information as possible before any actual surfing takes place, for example the duration, nature and terms of a guests stay are generally worked out in advance. Although safety may be a concern for some of you, it is stressed that the CouchSurfing project is based on a system of trust between members, security is provided mainly by personal references which hosts and surfers have the option to leave after using the service. It may not be everyone&rsquo;s cupan tae but with over a million members in 230 countries worldwide, Couchsurfing provides you with a huge range of travel destinations and the chance to meet interesting folk from all walks of life. Just remember, if you sign up, you may be expected to return the favour.\n\nFor more information, log onto <a href=\"http://\">www.couchsurfing.org</a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2630\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\" caption=\"CouchSurfing in the literal sense\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2439613358_127effeb74.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2630 \" title=\"2439613358_127effeb74\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/2439613358_127effeb74.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></a>[/caption]\n<h3>Travel option No. 2: <span style=\"color: #008000;\">WWOOFing</span></h3>\nWWOOF. Word Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms don&rsquo;cha know? WWOOF is an organisation that links volunteers with organic farmers and helps people to share more sustainable ways of living. In exchange for volunteer help, WWOOF hosts offer food, accommodation and opportunities to learn about organic lifestyles. For a small fee you can join your local WWOOF organisation, and you will then have access to lists of organic farms, smallholdings and gardeners who are currently or will soon be welcoming volunteers. You can then contact the owners directly to organise your stay. Volunteers do not have to pay any money for their stay, just as WWOOF hosts do not pay volunteers for their help. Labour is exchanged for clean, dry accommodation and good food. Working hours are agreed upon in advance, and volunteers will generally have plenty of free time to explore their surroundings. The list of possible destinations and experiences is vast, you can sign up for anything from harvesting crops in Korea to sowing wild flowers in France. Think of the tanning possibilities. A genuine interest in learning about organic growing and country living is recommended, but WWOOFing is open to everyone.\n\nFor more information, log onto <a href=\"http://www.wwoof.org\">www.wwoof.org</a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2631\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\" caption=\"One of the most rewarding summer ideas\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wwoof-cl-1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2631 \" title=\"wwoof-cl-1\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/wwoof-cl-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></a>[/caption]\n<h3>Travel option No. 3: <span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Au pairing</span></h3>\nBecoming an au pair is a great summer option for young people (girls <em>and </em>boys!) aged between 18 and 30. It&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity to improve your language skills and get acquainted with a new culture. You stay with a family in a country of your choice, and in exchange for minding their children and some light housework, you receive free board and lodging, a private room and even some pocket money (in Western European countries this ranges between 200 and 280 euros a month).\u00a0 The French term <em>au pair</em> means <em>on equal terms, </em>therefore you are encouraged to become a temporary member of the family rather than feel like the hired help. Working hours vary from family to family but in most cases the au pair will not be expected to work any more than 40 hours a week. This and other particulars, such as pocket money and sleeping arrangements, are best clarified in advance to avoid any misunderstanding. The family you stay with needn&rsquo;t be complete strangers before you arrive on their doorstep either. Many au pairs and their chosen families are in regular contact via email, phone and Skype months prior to the au pairs arrival, ensuring a certain amount of familiarity before travel. Au pair opportunities are available all over the world, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand and the USA being the most popular destinations.\n\nFor more information, log onto <a href=\"http://\">www.aupair-world.net</a>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2632\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\" caption=\"Au pair, a classic choice\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/au-pair.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2632 \" title=\"au pair\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/au-pair.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"314\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nSo there you have it!
