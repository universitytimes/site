Well, Irena is from Lviv in Ukraine, and she&rsquo;s never lived abroad. </em>\n<em>I mean, I clearly got it all wrong &ndash; so I&rsquo;ll just let you read about her, her fascinating background, stories and ideas! </em>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">1. Tell us about what you do...</span></h4>\nI have been a web designer for more than ten years now and an illustrator since 2007. Together with my colleague Eugene, I run a studio called &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.hellokeepa.com/\">Keepa</a>&rdquo;; most of my work is based on interface and design solutions, while illustration remains more of a hobby for the moment.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">2. How did you end up doing it?</span></h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=8929\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-8929\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-8929\" title=\"zablotska\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/zablotska3-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>I always liked technical web design and animation. However, in university, I graduated and then trained as a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) engineer, but I never enjoyed the idea of working in this field &ndash; this is the main reason why web graphic design became my main self-taught activity. Despite the difficult economic situation, and my parents&rsquo; critics for not having pursued the better remunerated GIS\u00a0engineering career, I decided to keep trying, at least for a while.\n\nThankfully, soon enough I found a job in one of Lviv&rsquo;s software companies &ndash; the job helped me to realise that what I had learnt by myself was not bad at all. Also, it was very enjoyable and combined personal satisfaction with a good wage.\n\nThen, a couple of years ago, I started painting, mostly because I got to know some local street artists. I was truly impressed by the freedom and energy they were radiating, it really gave a powerful impulse to my creative work. Soon after that, curators started inviting me to exhibit my work, and I suddenly realised that my art was actually appreciated by people, especially by some of the artists I had looked up to for so long.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">3. Where are you from originally &amp; what has taken you where you live now?</span></h4>\nI was born, raised and still live in Lviv. One of the main Ukrainian cities, it is known for its rich and impressive history. Its renowned magical atmosphere is given by the narrow medieval streets, and the picturesque architecture of the city, definitely the most beautiful in Eastern Europe; in fact, the city centre is part of the UNESCO Heritage.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">4. Where else would you ever live? Why?</span></h4>\nUnfortunately, I have never left Ukraine for more than 2 weeks and I truly regret it; living somewhere else would be a great experience. I would love to spend some time in Prague, for example; it is a city where you always find something new to explore and learn from, thanks to its amazing architecture and history. Even though travelling would be a very enriching experience, I would never leave to go far from Eastern Europe, I have a sincerely strong devotion towards my region. <a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=8930\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-8930\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8930\" title=\"loveis\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/loveis3-279x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"279\" height=\"300\" /></a>It is a very difficult feeling to explain, it must be because the roots of my family have been grounded here for generations and generations. It is nothing more than my home; a very spacious, cozy and beautiful home.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">5. What is missing in your city's art scene?</span></h4>\nLviv&rsquo;s art scene is very hidden and extremely hard to get through to. Young artists are not supported and, despite demonstrations, their freedom of expression is still constrained by the traditional views of schools&rsquo; art teachers. From here, everything seems to be a lot easier abroad.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">6. What has contributed the most towards what you have achieved?</span></h4>\nI know this might sound a bit bizarre, but I believe it was just a matter of luck. Everybody can draw. I am just lucky because my desire of self- expression and creativity is enormous and it has been my thirst for freedom and independence that proved the most helpful thing in managing to turn this passion into a job.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">7. At the age of 20, what did you think you were going to do &ldquo;in life&rdquo; - where did you see yourself in the future? Has your dream come true already?</span></h4>\nIn fact, when I was twenty, my dream was to become a professional web designer and to work in a big firm. I can confidently say that my dream has come true, even more than that. However, now, I really want to focus on drawing and I am hoping to do less and less of web design to fully dedicate my time to painting and illustration.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">8. What projects are you currently working on?</span></h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=8931\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-8931\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-8931\" title=\"pie\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pie3-271x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"271\" height=\"300\" /></a>I am currently working on the design of a large web portal associated with movies. I am also developing a web project in tandem with a great Romanian artist, I take care of the web site design and she is going to illustrate it. I hope it will turn out to be something very fascinating.\n\nI am also collaborating on a very colorful illustration with the talented local artist Dima Didora &ndash; it is a personal project that aims at aesthetic pleasure.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">9. If you could meet any artist &ndash; living or dead &ndash; who would it be?</span></h4>\nI would like to meet Otto Dix. I do not know what I would ask him, but I would probably be happy enough having the chance to have time to look at home, and examine his face, eyes, hands.\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">10. And finally, if you could do anything at any time anywhere in the world, what would you do?</span></h4>\nIf I had the opportunity, I would probably lose my mind and do nothing until my time expires - indecision is what I have to fight against every day of my life.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\">The traveller corner </span>&ndash; Irena's tips if you were to go to Lviv:</h4>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Art Gallery</span>: Lviv National Art Gallery -\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.lvivbest.com/en/museums/lviv-art-gallery\">http://www.lvivbest.com/en/museums/lviv-art-gallery</a>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Theatre</span>: Les Kurbas Theatre - <a href=\"http://n.kurbas.lviv.ua/\">http://n.kurbas.lviv.ua/</a>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Band</span>: Dead Rooster - <a href=\"http://deadrooster.org.ua/\">http://deadrooster.org.ua/</a>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Gig Vevue</span>: Flugery Lvova - <a href=\"http://dzyga.com/flugery/index.php?lang=en\">http://dzyga.com/flugery/index.php?lang=en</a>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Area of the city</span>: Rynok Square - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Square_(Lviv)\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_Square_(Lviv)</a>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Shop</span>: Bookshop on Fedorov Street - <a href=\"http://www.lvivguide.info/en/lviv- sightseeing/around-rynok-square/14-ivan-fedorov-street.html\">http://www.lvivguide.info/en/lviv- sightseeing/around-rynok-square/14-ivan-fedorov-street.html</a>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Cafe</span>: Art-Caf\u00e9 Kvartyra 35 -\u00a0<a href=\"http://dzyga.com/content/view/63/219/lang,en/\">http://dzyga.com/content/view/63/219/lang,en/</a>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\">Hostel/B&amp;B</span>: Old City Hostel - <a href=\"http://oldcityhostel.lviv.ua/\">http://oldcityhostel.lviv.ua/</a>\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "8924", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8923", "Heading": "&ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; Our little window on young emerging art - Irena Zablotska"}
