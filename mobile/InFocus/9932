We have become a society living beyond our means, we are 'moving forward' by building sand castles from the wet dirt we release as technology, industry and finance. But when these castles become too massive they will crack and crumble upon themselves to be cleaned away by the wash of time. Eventually mankind and all its trinkets will disappear into a universe too cold to laugh, cry or rage, a universe far more powerful than mankind will ever be.\n<div>But why should we bother fighting for liberation in the face of this suffocating truth? Perhaps because the whole truth is more than this. Through the complex of human imagination we have created a thing called `beauty', a reflection of the impossibility of existence.</div>\nWhen Van Gogh gave new life to rough canvas he recreated an existence, or what he understood it to be. The harsh and honest flick of his wrist showed us that there is more to our world than we originally thought, he painted mankind's control over the universe - he showed that mankind can compete with the vastness of nature.<img src=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/images/cleardot.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n<div>Experiencing the boldness of Van Gogh's paintings or the brilliance of Beethoven, imagining the depth of Beckett or the fire of Godard, contemplating the teasing of Cantor or the genius of Schrodinger - we are participating in this act of defiance.For me it is the power of their sublime expression that provides a solid base against the call of the crumbling castle. But it is only through improbable chance that I have been exposed to this enlightenment - and it certainly was not through formal schooling. Throughout my primary and secondary education I was crippled with boredom; taught through the lens of classical beliefs, restricted by a bureaucratic clamp, the spirit of knowledge was bled dry . . .\n\nAmong the few Leaving Certificate subjects that brushed upon pure thought was mathematics. In response to the declining Irish maths scores in PISA and similar studies, the Department of Education is implementing a new mathematics curriculum named 'Project Maths' that has replaced the little pure maths, that was before, with the mathematics of industry, finance and government. This is being done in order to position mathematics in a context relatable to everyday life. Rather than introduce its history, interesting applications and theories, or the clever concepts that so simply show the beauty of maths, we have created a false impression of what mathematics really is - we are cheating our young and preparing them to do the same.\n\nThis curriculum is a superficial solution to a misunderstood problem - a highly infectious problem, growing in every part of our society. To fix our education system we must address a wound deeper than we are trained to see, and we must do so before the sand-castles fail.\n\n</div>", "Imageurl": "9933", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "9932", "Heading": "The Dying Animal: III"}
