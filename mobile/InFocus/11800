Having grown up during the Celtic Tiger and then coming into maturity as it all fell apart I had developed a certain type of hatred for Ireland. I disliked nearly everything about this country from our acceptance of inept politicians to the dull and homogenous south Dublin culture I was brought up in. I wanted to leave so much that I applied to study permanently in Edinburgh. When this failed I decided that studying French was the next best thing to getting out of here as fast as I could. My plan was to go to Trinity, learn French, get away for a year, and then, once I graduated, move to Paris or a former French colony and never look back (except, maybe, for Christmas).\n\nBut when it came to seriously considering the thought of leaving Ireland and everything about it that I would miss I&rsquo;ve already realised how much nationality can mean to someone. I have come around to the idea that although Ireland is flawed there are still many great things about it. This is not the time and place to discuss in detail what they are but there are different things about this country that we all would not like to do without. My friends often complain, as I have, that there is a lack of diversity in Ireland, especially culturally and politically, that everything is done on a small scale and only a cheap imitation of something done before, usually in London or New York. But having reflected on this, I have realised it is partly up to us as future graduates to change this. My sentiment towards my home has changed now that I am leaving it for a year. It is easy (and dull) to say everything in Ireland always has been or is now gone to shit and that we might as well move away and turn our back on it. We are free to change this if we feel it is so.\n\nAfter my first year at college and realising that on reflection my disdain for this country had morphed into a quiet respect I changed courses from Philosophy and French to Philosophy and Political Science. I am still going on Erasmus to Paris for a year but now with the intention of developing a fresh perspective from which to judge the state of affairs at home and, possibly, how to change them for the better in some way. I expect to have a great time and, from speaking to others that have already been, to appreciate a level of freedom that I have not yet, or possibly may never again, experience. Living in France as a student with partial financial support from my family and the EU is a rare opportunity and I plan to make the most of it. Leaving Ireland and everything that is wrong with it behind will undoubtedly be a beneficial experience. I do not plan to spend my days there lamenting for my homeland, though I do think I will always end up comparing things to how they are &ldquo;at home&rdquo;.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to often remind myself of the George Bernard Shaw quote that &lsquo;Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it&rsquo;. But to reduce an emotion that millions have felt so strongly as to die for to basic egoism is an oversimplification. It is much more complicated than that. Instead, I see patriotism as something similar to a familial connection. We may not fully understand why we love the inevitably somewhat flawed people or country to which we were born. But, for most of us, we know that we do.\n\nThe Erasmus exchange programme was developed by the European Union to, amongst other things, &ldquo;foster pan-European identity&rdquo;. I am sceptical that on my return I will consider myself any more &ldquo;European&rdquo; than the day I left. Rather, what I have learnt from this early stage of the experience is that patriotism is a complex and compelling thing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "11801", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "11800", "Heading": "A Fonder View of Home"}
