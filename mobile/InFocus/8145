Well, I sort of take it back.\n\nThe day started fairly slowly before signs of life began to emerge at a hustings session at 1pm on the Dining Hall steps, a 5pm session of same hosted by Trinity's LGBT Society Q-Soc, and a hell of a lot in between. <em>The University Times </em>launched its first poll which, while not scientific and open to abuse if you're into that, is nonetheless an indicator of how candidates have fared thus far. There's a lot to get through so let's hear some results and reports:\n<h2><strong>President</strong></h2>\n<address>Rory Dunne - 37.5%</address><address>James Kelly - 28.1%</address><address>John Tighe - 4.9%</address>After two days of campaigning, Rory Dunne leads James Kelly by 9.4% in the race to be TCDSU President. John Tighe polled third of the three, some 23.2%\u00a0behind\u00a0Kelly.\n\nSadly, a family bereavement saw Kelly return home to Wexford, with campaign manager Darren O'Gorman representing him at hustings. President correspondent Ronan Richardson noted in the early afternoon that Rory Dunne and John Tighe appeared reluctant to deploy their campaigners with Kelly absent, but <em>The University Times</em> understands that the Kelly campaign were eager for canvassing to proceed as normal.\n\nSpeaking at the early afternoon hustings session, Dunne told those assembled that KMPG were 'very interested' in his proposed Trinity-exclusive internship scheme, while positive correspondence with MIT and a number of other institutions had also taken place. O'Gorman spoke on behalf of Kelly, reaffirming his candidate's major policy points and propounding his wealth of experience. Tighe once again declared himself an alternative to SU bureaucracy, proposing a radical overhaul of the class rep system and a\u00a0re-politicisation\u00a0of students' union activity.\n\nWhat is most apparent to me is that Tighe seems to have been cast away by potential voters prejudicially. While he lacks Dunne's articulate speech and has confirmed that his campaign manager resigned for academic reasons, he is bright, he does understand the implications of what he says, and by all accounts has been underestimated.\n\nHis performance and depth of knowledge demonstrated at the evening's LGBT hustings session were certainly noteworthy. The deficit he seems to face may be huge, but don't rule out an increasing level of support throughout the week.\n\nThis one definitely isn't over.\n<h2>Education</h2>\n<address>Dan Ferrick - 59.7%</address><address>Re-Open Nominations - 19.1%</address>While I am surprised that nearly one in five students surveyed indicated that they would vote to re-open nominations in the education race, it is no surprise to see Ferrick looking comfortable on nearly 60%.\n\nFerrick's first major activity of the day was the Dining Hall hustings, at which he was well-received. In an interview with Trinity FM straight after - which will be available from the UT Facebook tomorrow morning - TFM presenter D\u00e1irne Black grilled Ferrick on the Union's contribution towards class rep training. For me, he survived unscathed, concluding the interview by stating that members of the Union get great value for their money spent on the service, which roughly amounts to 50c per capitated student.\n\nFerrick did, however, find himself in a difficult position at LGBT hustings later that day. At a meeting of SU council in November, Ferrick proposed an amendment to a motion mandating 'all [elected representatives] of the union to publicly and actively campaign for equal civil marriage rights for LGBT people' on the grounds that it may be unconstitutional to mandate an officer to do something that impinges on personal rights or freedoms. When the subject was raised by the moderator, Ferrick insisted that the importance of the motion was such that he did not wish to see a technicality prevent its enactment before a member of the audience incorrectly suggested that the motion had been deemed constitutional in advance of the meeting.\n\nThat kind of ill-informed question can have a devastating effect on a campaign because it incorrectly paints Ferrick as an opponent on LGBT rights. With that in mind, I contacted the electoral commission for confirmation. You can read the statement in which EC chair Siobh\u00e1n Fletcher confirms that the ruling took place after the debate on the motion on another post soon. Tellingly, it begins:\n<blockquote>The Electoral Commission was asked to make a constitutional interpretation by a member of Council after voting took place on a motion at SU Council 22/11/11.</blockquote>\nApart from that, a good day for Ferrick.\n<h2>Welfare</h2>\n<address>Emma Walker - 31.6%</address><address>Aisling N\u00ed Chonaire - 29.4%</address><address>Andy Haughey - 14.5%</address>\u00a0A 2.2% lead in a vote of 603 students is not much, but it's a lead nonetheless. Emma Walker leads Aisling N\u00ed Chonaire by that tiny margin, with Andy Haughey a further 14.9% behind.\n\nThat Andy is polling so far behind the other candidates comes as a surprise to me; he was well-received and enthusiastic to the point of near-implosion at hustings, had the crowd engaged at LGBT hustings and must certainly have spoken to more people one-on-one than any other candidate. As I said yesterday, don't call this one a two-horse race just yet.\n\nAll-in-all, the three candidates seem to have been well-received at hustings. Welfare Correspondent Emma Tobin noted that in lecture addresses, 'each candidate took a different angle: N\u00ed Chonaire touting her experience, Haughey his policies and Walker a little bit of both.' From what we saw on the steps of the Dining Hall, the pattern was largely uniform. Emma compiled her findings into a more comprehensive piece available in <a href=\"www.universitytimes.ie/?p=8153\">another post</a>, such was the focus on welfare candidates today.\n\nI have to say, I was quite sceptical of N\u00ed Chonaire's 'Welfare App' proposal, but when I asked her after hustings she proved that she had researched the matter and that it was a runner in that a grant is available and obtainable. Carry on, so.\n\nAs I said before, too much went on today for this to go into one blog, so have a look at Emma's. This race is still contested by three horses.\n<h2>Communications</h2>\n<address>Owen 'Cabbage' Bennett - 39.5%</address><address>James Hagan - 30.3%</address><address>Hannah Cogan - 12.2%</address>Interesting one, this. Despite the long-anticipated appearance of Lobby the Lobstar in Hagan red, 39.5% potential voters are swung by Owen 'Cabbage' Bennett, whom they also voted the most impressive of all eleven candidates. As such, Bennett has made a mockery of this blog's suggestions that his use of a cartoon cabbage in lieu of his face on campaign posters would hinder his campaign.\n\nAt hustings, Bennett reminded the assembled crowd of his plan to hold daily clinics. He said that he personally would be sitting there and that and made the promise: \"I'll make sure your voice is heard.\" Bennett said that he hopes to hold more Town Hall Meetings, claiming that Trinity College has\u00a0some of the \"best minds in the country\". \"There's more to it than the Provost\" he said with regard to the Provost's hesitancy to be face non-scripted questions, \"everyone has a point to make\". He did go on to say that attendance at such meetings is\u00a0\"in the Provost's own interest.\" He addressed his plans for a societies section in the UT and his proposed 'Week in Trinity' videos as part of his ambition to improve the social side of college life. He echoed this sentiment later on at the LGBT hustings, saying that the videos are a good way to promote what is one of Trinity's fastest growing societies.\n\nCogan said that the SU will be relying on external communications \"like never before\" and that her political communications experience would be helpful in this regard. She said that issues need not be \"farmed out to the USI\". She claimed that while the UT is \"nearly there\", it should be perfect. She said that hosting First Year journalism training programmes would be beneficial in recruiting new writers. She stressed the need to make the SU a\u00a0\"more relevant, more legitimate\" union with greater\u00a0student input.\u00a0Part of her plan to achieve this aim is to publish the SU's accounts.\u00a0At the LGBT hustings, Cogan said that it was \"sad that issues like this still need to be discussed\" and that she would be excited to be able to communicate college's message on issues like equal marriage. She also gave credit to her opponent, James Hagan's article dealing with the lives of transgender students published earlier on in the year in the UT calling it \"one of the best stories run this year\".\n\nLast to speak, Hagan spoke in detail about his proposed expansion of the SU food deals. He said that he wanted to bring them back to the level they were at last year as they have \"slipped a bit\" this year. He said that he wanted people to register for these deals online, in the hope that they stay for the SU video content. He mentioned that while videos uploaded by the position's current holder, Ronan Costello, at the start of the year were good, \"it's only hacks who watch them.\" \"If you're going for the food, you'll have to watch them!\"\n\nAs far as the UT is concerned, Hagan jokingly\u00a0said that he hoped to keep an eye on college's \"sneaky little projects\" and that his lack of editorial experience does not concern him. \"I've watched every editor and seen their strengths and weaknesses. I know how to generate content.\" Hagan gave perhaps the most personal address at the LGBT hustings, saying that the society was one of his \"first points of contact\" in college life and that he is the most \"in touch\" of the candidates with regard to LGBT issues.\n\nAn interesting question posed from the floor at the LGBT hustings saw disagreement among the candidates. The candidates, with a question echoeing the current college-wide Irish Daily Mail ban,\u00a0were asked if they would support the banning of a paper in the wake of a personal attack such as the high profile incident that saw The Sun attack a transgender lecturer in the College.\n\nBennett warned that while banning newspapers sets a negative precedent, he would support a ban after \"adequate consultation with the student body\" and should the student body support it. Cogan rejected the idea as support for freedom of speech, saying\u00a0\"this is a slanderous, personal attack.\u00a0A criminal act. That's the type of axe you bring down on them.\" Hagan, giving his personal view on the matter,\u00a0asked the audience \"what's more important: freedom of the press or having morals?\"\n\nWhile I find it hard to pick a winner for the day - all three candidates really did perform fantastically once again - the polls have made that call on my behalf. To be fair to Owen, he had a really good showing at both hustings sessions. It makes for an interesting rest of the week, in which all three candidates, once again, are still well in the race.\n\nI thought the poll would place Hagan ever so slightly above the other two after a stronger first day, and that there would be a maximum of 5% separating the three. I can't believe that Cogan is so far back, but she's a fighter and when fighters are down, they fight harder.\n<div><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVEnCAhAP1A&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><em>See the communications debate here.</em></a></div>\n<h2>Ents</h2>\n<address>David Whelan - 59.2%</address><address>RON - 25%</address>Ladies and gentlemen, we have our first fine. While neither the campaign team nor the EC have confirmed what exactly the fine is for, David Whelan has been forbidden the use of his campaign Facebook page for the next two days. In a statement, campaign manager Jack Cantillon said the following:\n<blockquote>We're disappointed to have our Facebook page unpublished until 6pm on Thursday evening. We hope to more than make up for an online absence with a great on-campus presence and continue to convince an already hugely positive electorate that David Whelan is the man for Ents next year.</blockquote>\nDespite the setback, Whelan seems to be doing just fine. Before jokingly coining his new slogan &ldquo;Whelan for Wents,&rdquo; Whelan, the only candidate called upon for the Ents hustings made a delayed ENTrance (haw haw) from the top of the steps of the dining hall today at 1pm.\n\nHe spoke confidently and enthusiastically about his manifesto points from the same level as the audience, perhaps eliminating any authoritative attitudes created by the previous candidates who spoke five or six steps above their spectators. As he teased about the potential trips to an industrial estate in Cavan to &ldquo;have a big rave&rdquo; he informed students that he wants to use the chapel building as a location to hold acoustic gigs for acts such as James Vincent McMorrow.\n\nWhelan then addressed his proposal of Pre-drinks FM, referring to its style as &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; but not in fact pirate by nature explained by Whelan because &ldquo;we&rsquo;re Trinity Ents and we&rsquo;re totally legit.&rdquo; The purpose of the show is for students to text in requests and to send &lsquo;slagging&rsquo; messages about their friends to be read out on the show. The concept is yet to be distinguished from any other national radio station listened to by students before heading out.\n\nWhelan then went on to state that he doesn&rsquo;t want to adopt the responsibility of the meal &lsquo;deal of the week&rsquo; but wants to expand the deals to Ents activities including bring your own beer bowling, viking spash tours and claims that he has already been in talks with owners of Savoy and Screen cinemas to organize &euro;3 cinema deals (as opposed to the current &euro;4 cinema deals for students not limited to Trinity.)\n\nWhen asked about live music and Trinity bands and acts, whether they&rsquo;d be supported by Ents or have the opportunity to use Ents as a platform for establishing themselves amongst the Dublin and Irish music scene, Whelan was adamant that Trinity talent would be encouraged by the hopeful candidate himself. Contrary to information received by The University Times stating that Whelan didn&rsquo;t in fact have any priority towards Trinity acts or live music around college, when questioned, the Laois man proposed to have a weekly live set before a night club for Trinity bands resonating former Ents Officer Darragh Genockey&rsquo;s concoction of Tuesday night live.\n\nHowever, this night Whelan promises the location for the gig and the club venue to be the same place as opposed to students heading to Captain America&rsquo;s only to find themselves spending excessive amounts on food and drink while listening to the bands before heading to another location for the night. Whelan prioritizes keeping costs low for students in this circumstance where there would only be one entrance fee for both the gig and the club afterwards.\nWhelan&rsquo;s main focus of his whole manifesto falls on the proposal of &lsquo;Project Warehouse&rsquo; previously seen in the UK. The ents hopeful insists he has already researched his idea and plans to acquire the building behind the venue Vicar Street for his new undertaking if elected.\n\nA question regarding a possible night link service to students was also posed to Whelan at hustings earlier today. He unmistakably attempted to establish himself as a democratic Ents Officer working towards what the students want as he responded that if there was sufficient interest or need of a late night shuttle bus service suggested by a large group of friends or Halls residents (a service already provided by the JCR for Halls nights out?) then he would consider integrating such a facility into Ents. At such an early stage in his campaign does Whelan already feel pressured into adopting additional points into his manifesto in order to gain votes and to provide what the students want to hear as opposed to remaining realistic, upholding his original plans minus any extensions and thus enabling him to keep his promises if elected?\n\nOverall however, a successful hustings for Whelan on Day 2 of campaigning and it was evident that he was pleased himself as co-correspondent Nicole O&rsquo;Sullivan noticed Whelan step towards his campaign manager Jack Cantillon for a cheeky fist pump before approaching the rest of his team of warm congratulations and pats of support.\n\nWell, that's that. It's been a mad day but things have finally picked up around here. I'm still yet to be convinced that any of the candidates have shown enough to prove that they really and truly deserve the job for which they are campaigning, but there's still time for that. Let's hope everyone realises that there's none allotted for wasting.\n\n<address>Ents section by Shauna Watson</address><address>Communications section by Fionn O'Dea and Jack Leahy</address>", "Imageurl": "8159", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8145", "Heading": "How To Win Votes and Influence People: Day 2"}
