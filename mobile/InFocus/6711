{"Body": "<strong>Ronan Costello</strong>\n<em>Editor</em>\n<em>The University Times</em> has received an excerpt of a letter which reveals that former Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan and Central Bank governor Patrick Honohan had explicitly promised the IMF that the government would increase the student contribution from 2012-2014. The excerpt comes from a letter written to Dominique Strauss Kahn, who was then head of the IMF. The letter appears in the appendix to the memorandum of understanding between the then government and the IMF.\n\nBoth Fine Gael and Labour were aware of this promise before the general election. Minister for Education Ruair\u00ed Quinn signed the USI pledge not to increase the student contribution in the knowledge that the Fianna F\u00e1il government had made these guarantees with the EU, ECB and IMF troika.\n\nThis aspect of the agreement, like all aspects of it, are up for negotiation and the troika has consistently said that the Irish government can make the necessary savings in whatever way it sees fit. Thus, the current Fine Gael/Labour government is not completely tied to guarantees made by the previous government.\n\nHowever, <em>The University Times</em> has learned that Minister Quinn, while briefing Labour party colleagues, stated that he preferred an incremental increase to the student contribution over the period outlined in the excerpt below. This would suggest that Minister Quinn intends to adhere to the promise made by Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nThe excerpt:\n<blockquote>To secure our fiscal targets, a number of fiscal measures have been identifiedfor 2012&ndash;14. We will continue to rely on expenditure savings (&euro;6.1 billion), led by current\u00a0spending (&euro;4.9 billion), as outlined in the National Recovery Plan. We are targeting further\u00a0reductions in public sector numbers, social benefits and programme spending, and have\u00a0anchored the prospective savings by publishing multi-year expenditure ceilings by Vote\u00a0Group through 2014. We are also planning to move towards full cost-recovery in the\u00a0provision of water services and ensuring a greater student contribution towards tertiary\u00a0education, while ensuring that lower-income groups remain supported. In addition, we will\u00a0accelerate the process of placing the pension systems on a path consistent with long-term\u00a0sustainability of public finances. On the tax side, we will build on the base-broadening\u00a0measures outlined above and establish a sound basis for sub-national finances through a new\u00a0residential-property based site value tax. The Finance Bill 2012 will contain necessary\u00a0provisions to bring into effect the already signalled VAT increases in 2013 and 2014.</blockquote>\n<em>Additional reporting by R\u00f3n\u00e1n Burtenshaw, Deputy Editor.
