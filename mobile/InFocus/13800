{"Body": "&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Harriet Hughes | </strong>Contributing Writer\n\nThis year&rsquo;s Debut Shows kicked off on Wednesday, and this week&rsquo;s shows certainly\u00a0provided an evening of contrast! I did the double whammy and caught Ferdia Cahill&rsquo;s Romeo\u00a0and Juliet at 6pm, followed by Ricky McCormack&rsquo;s Shopping and F***ing at 8pm, the first\u00a0two shows of the five to come over the next three weeks.\n\nThe Debut shows are the work of the final year Trinity Drama and Theatre Studies directing\u00a0class. Each show is no longer than an hour, and can range from Shakespeare to Albee to\u00a0Ravenhill. There&rsquo;s bound to be one that does it for you, theatrically speaking, so make sure to\u00a0head down to the Samuel Beckett theatre before week 12 to catch one.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13828\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"496\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/12/04/a-debut-review/bd-beckettsign-21-620x507-2/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13828\"><img class=\" wp-image-13828 \" title=\"bd-beckettsign-21-620x507\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/bd-beckettsign-21-620x50713.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"496\" height=\"406\" /></a> The Beckett theatre will host the Debut shows, a celebration of the work of final year Drama and Theatre Studies students.[/caption]\n\nThe evening&rsquo;s viewing started off for me with Romeo and Juliet, directed, costume and set\u00a0designed by Ferdia Cahill. The set provided everything you might associate with a traditional\u00a0Montague/Capulet divide (house of Montague stage left, house of Capulet stage right) with\u00a0the added twist of a large pool (for want of a better word) centre stage. This pool served as\u00a0fountain, moon (when lit from above, with reflections cast beautifully over the ceiling and set\u00a0walls) and tomb. What could be initially have been interpreted as a town gathering point took\u00a0on a symbolic edge, as Juliet was laid in the shallow water. The cloaks of the cast members\u00a0who placed her there became soaked, dripping ominously as they left the stage, and adding to\u00a0the sense of heightened claustrophobia and dank abandonment.\n\nThe show had a large cast of sixteen, yet there was a cohesive sense of ensemble throughout\u00a0the piece. The large Capulet party and opening fight scene were perfect examples of this,\u00a0and the stage combat throughout the play deserves praise. The Mercutio/Tybalt death scene\u00a0in particular contained well rehearsed, professional, painfully realistic blows (a certain high\u00a0kick caused the girl next to me to swear&hellip;) Stand out performances have to be credited to the\u00a0double acts of both Romeo (Sean Doyle) and Benvolio (Eddie Murphy), who transformed\u00a0the Shakespearean text of brotherhood into a modern day context, and the Nurse (Lucy\u00a0Withrington) and Friar (Sam Coll), who used humour and an understanding of the lyricism of\u00a0the text respectively to add to the overall performance.\n\nThe next performance in store was Shopping and F***ing , directed by Ricky McCormack.\u00a0There couldn&rsquo;t really be a more stark contrast between two theatrical experiences.\u00a0McCormack&rsquo;s set pulsed with a techno beat throughout, it was up lit in red, framed upstage\u00a0by a wooden picket fence that could have been an urban skyline. Around the stage was\u00a0positioned: a mattress, a raised wooden platform, a sofa, a TV. The action circled around\u00a0these key features, flitting between the living room of two best friends desperate for money\nand dealing ecstasy, to an interview room, to a hotel room frequented by gay prostitutes, to\u00a0a shop changing room. Seamless light changes and the introduction of that familiar heavy\u00a0techno beat helped moved the action fluidly around the stage, never leaving an awkward gap\u00a0between scenes.\n\nThe piece was beautifully cast, so crucial in a piece with such few cast members, with stand\u00a0out moments from every single performer. Four men (Andrew Oakes, Andy Duanne, Patrick\u00a0Culhane, Matthew Brazel) and one woman (Claire O&rsquo; Reilly) led the audience through a\u00a0visceral experience of real life: real claustrophobia, real desperation, real perversion. The\u00a0content is not for the faint hearted. Anal sex is simulated on stage, the play deals with drug\u00a0addiction, child abuse, and the lengths you&rsquo;re prepared to go through if you owe a manic\n\u01413000. The piece is powerful, in-yer-face, thought provoking, and moving.\n\nEven if you&rsquo;re not a theatre go-er, there&rsquo;s something down at the Beckett this week worth\u00a0seeing. Support fellow students, see something different, it doesn&rsquo;t matter why you go, just\u00a0make sure you get down there.", "Imageurl": "13828", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13800", "Heading": "A Debut Review "}
