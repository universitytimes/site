{"Body": "<em>This article is a counter to\u00a0<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/?p=19713\">http://universitytimes.ie/?p=19713</a></em>\r\n\r\nSo here comes a hippy to throw red paint over the fur-cloaked arguments of our Damien. Right, so to be perfectly fair to all sides, we can all appreciate the fact that there are some people who like fur. It makes sense. Fur is soft, it&rsquo;s warm, and it gives the same feeling as your favourite onesie for about a hundred times the price! Realistically, the whole human race was in furs once upon a time, so some would argue that it&rsquo;s as natural as continuing the farming industry. However, from a clothing perspective, we now have so many better options. We have evolved both fashion and practicality to give us thousands upon thousands of clothing choices that don&rsquo;t require another living creature to suffer.\r\n\r\nI believe that every living creature has an equal right to life. That includes the ugly ones, the useless ones, and even the vicious ones. The animals exploited in the fur industry may not be barbarically hunted down like they once were, but being bred in captivity for the specific goal of slaughter is equally despicable. Let it be made clear that these are not free-range minks that go into fur coats. If you are outraged by battery farming or puppy farming, you should be outraged by the fur industry. These animals live short lives in horrendous conditions to serve a commercial end. Farming, it can be argued, kills animals for profit too. But food is a necessity. Show me a person who <i>needs </i>fur and I will show you a damned liar! \u00a0I appreciate that many fur-supporters will refute my argument with references to the numerous animals grown for meat and say it is not a necessity either, but let&rsquo;s be realistic here: \u00a0a steak will fuel your body. It provides you with iron, protein and other nutrients that your body benefits from. A fur coat might just make you look nice, which you could do for less than a quarter of the price and without harming animals by wearing faux fur.\r\n\r\nFur is luxurious<i>. </i>It cannot be denied that faux fur doesn&rsquo;t give that feeling of decadence that you would get from a fur coat. But I say if you want decadence buy gold! Buy designer! Don&rsquo;t kill an animal. If you wouldn&rsquo;t wear your pet dog or cat then you shouldn&rsquo;t support fur. Remember the disgust you felt for Cruella DeVille in <i>101 Dalmations? </i>If it had been called <i>101 Minks </i>the fur industry would probably be bust by now.\u00a0 As for the people who work in the fur industry, I&rsquo;m sure in this age of consumerism there are numerous opportunities out there for people unwilling to sell something that some people might consider morally objectionable-in fact it&rsquo;s probably a CV booster!\r\n\r\nI respect people&rsquo;s right to want what they want, and if something is sold people have a right to desire and buy it. However I don&rsquo;t agree with sweat shops, or battery farming, or sex-trafficking, or hunting so I cannot agree with the fur industry &ndash;where yet another living creature is abused for the profit or enjoyment of someone else, especially when the product is something as inessential as fur. In this day and age, there is no need for fur, only want. And killing something to satisfy a want is murder.\r\n\r\n<em>To view Part I of the debate, <a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/?p=19713\">click here</a>.\u00a0</em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSCF14611.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19732", "Heading": "Is Fur Murder? - Part II "}
