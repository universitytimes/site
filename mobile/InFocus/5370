Renowned as the most prestigious undergraduate award in the country the scholarship provides students with five years of free academic study, accommodation in rooms and an annual salary of 254 euros, supposedly even the right to graze one&rsquo;s sheep on the college&rsquo;s grassy areas. All of this and those coveted three letters, &lsquo;Sch.&rsquo;, a suffix shared with past alumni such as Samuel Beckett, Ernest Walton, Brian Lenihan and even the late R.B. McDowell, who was awarded the scholarship in his first year of college.\n\nHowever, Trinity Monday is but a distant fantasy/nightmare to current senior freshman students determining if going for &lsquo;Schols&rsquo; is worth the pre-supposed sacrifice of social lives, society participation and hobbies, and all at the risk of failing to meet the 70% mark required to qualify as a scholar.\n\nStephen Yates, the under-graduate representative of Schols, explains the benefits of studying for schols, despite its stigma as an incredibly intensive study period, with one student even referring to it as &lsquo;the most traumatic experience of my short life&rsquo;.\n\n&lsquo;Despite the obvious attraction of getting your fees paid for and the privialege of Schols, it puts you in a very good mindset, setting you up for third and fourth year by developing good study habits and getting used to long hours of study. It also gives you an advantage when it comes to Christmas and summer exams &rsquo;.\n\nAs regards the heavy and arduos workload Yates admits that you do have to make sacrifices and give up a lot of time. &lsquo;People vary. Some only study for a couple of weeks and others a few months. It depends on the individual. However there is a danger of burning out if you try to study nine until nine in the library too soon in advance. Most people begin studying in September or October and do the bulk of the focused study during the Christmas Holidays&rsquo;.\n\nDespite the intense workload many students are deterred by unsatisfactory junior freshman results but Stephen denies this is an important factor. &lsquo;People who got firsts in Junior Freshman are not guaranteed a first in Schols.\u00a0 I know people who got 2:2&rsquo;s and still got it. You simply have to ask yourself, am I capable of this? If you feel you didn&rsquo;t push yourself but you&rsquo;ve got a lot left it&rsquo;s worth taking the chance.&rsquo;\n\nUp until the review of Schols in 2008, students who received a 2:1 or above were exempt from summer exams. While this condition was cancelled due to an increased incidence of lower course attendance following schols and a need to meet EU standardization of semesterized examinations, Stephen insists Schols is still worth going for.\n\n&lsquo;Think of how much you&rsquo;re willing to sacrifice. It&rsquo;s a tough road but if you&rsquo;re willing to put in the time and effort, then it is worth it, not just for the prize, but the skills gained&rsquo;.\n\nWhile Trinity students clearly stand to gain from Schols, what is the colleges purpose in electing foundation scholars? &lsquo;The Foundation Scholarship is the college&rsquo;s way of giving an incentive to our top students to stay within the college, indicated in that we pay for three years of post-graduate level study. A lot of our lectures are Scholars and often become fellows after that&rsquo;.\n\nYates admits the college benefits from its scholars in that they are an academic investment contributing to research expertise and as such keeps Trinity&rsquo;s rankings high. While Trinity&rsquo;s rankings have recently fallen 41 places according to the Times Higher Education Authority Yates denies a connection. Dr. Patrick Prendergast defended Trinity&rsquo;s standard, regarding the fall as instead due to funding and staff shortage issues, pointing out that Trinity reached a record high score for research levels.\n\nWhile the university has the capability to compete at top level, recent funding issues have caused concern that they pose as a threat to the number of scholarships rewarded. While the number of foundation scholars is set at seventy, many additional students are awarded the scholarship if merit requires. However, with the provost indicating the introduction of fees for those who can afford them for the benefit of the college, is there a threat to the generous funding of scholarship awards?\n\n&lsquo;Despite recession the number of Schols have remained at a steady 80 for the last few years&rsquo; says Barra Roantree, the secretary of the Scholarship Board.&rsquo; While I&rsquo;m sure it varies somewhat depending on our financial situation, the funding is mandatory as it comes form an endowment specified in the charters. Ultimately the money is there for it. If they could cut it they probably would have by now&rsquo;.\n\nAs research areas are integral to college rankings is it possible that the college may give preference to more profitable areas than others in terms of research and reputation? Stephen Yates however insists that while there has been an upward trend in scholarships awarded to those in medicine and engineering in recent years, there has equally been an increase in TSM students awarded Schols. &rsquo;It really depends on standard. The alumnus have agreed that no predetermined number have been decided on in each area. \u00a0It is a merit-based system and if someone is above standard they will be duly recommended by their department&rsquo;.\n\nGiven the sacrifices and opportunities of Schols, perhaps there can in the end be only one deciding factor, the rumored ancient entitlements of Trinity Scholars. &lsquo;No&rsquo;, intercepts Barra, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the rumors of being able to graze your sheep, carry a sword, request a mid-exam pint of ale, guard the provost and use the tunnels are false. Unfortunately, no future scholars will be sword-fighting henchmen, drunk off ale, in the tunnels while on a sheep.\n\nI hope this doesn&rsquo;t put you off&rsquo;.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "5372", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5370", "Heading": "The Schol Dilemma"}
