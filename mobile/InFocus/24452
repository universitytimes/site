{"Body": "<strong>Daire Collins</strong>\n<strong>8:00</strong>\r\n\r\nSo it's really early here. George is having a much needed shower But Team 27 is hitting the slopes. We have managed to blag our way onto another bus heading to the slopes but no other plans or connections. We want to be the first Jailbreakers to ski for free.\r\n\r\n<strong>***</strong>\r\n\r\nSo we've made it to Bruncio, or Brunchen. Which is pretty much in Austria, but In Italy technically. Our plan to find an Irish pub and crash there failed dramatically, as Brunchen lacks in Irish pubs. It turns out that every hotel costst he exact same, and aren't used to last minute arrivals. However at our lowest moment, our faith has been restored by the New Horizons ski and snow board group Omagh. A plan has been set in motion and after we leave this four star hotel tomorrow morning we will succeed, hopefully. Night all 'twas a long day.\r\n\r\n<strong>23:00</strong>\r\n\r\nCurrently checking in from 30,000 ft, where George and myself have had an opportunity to crack open our first brew of the trip. No one said this was gonna be easy and it hasn't been. That said it's been great craic. A Derrywegian TCD law student (probably not?) kindly offered her guide skills as she brought us from the train to the bus centre. With a quick photo opportunity at Belfast City Hall, where we arrived in the midst of a Mini Cooper Rally.\r\n\r\nFrom there we had to make it out to Belfast Interntational Airport in the next hour, which it turns out is not really in Belfast. We timed it pretty well, managed to blag our way onto the transl ink bus. After a bit of name issue with Guuuroeurrgi's (George's real name) name on the ticket, we were waved through. Destination is Verona, home to Romeo and Juliet. Flight time 2 and a half hours. Covering significantly more miles than we were this morning.\r\n\r\nThe flight turned out to offer some down time, with no possibility of internet access and the journey taking its toll on us, we managed to get in some sleep. However it looks like it's going to be a very brief trip as we managed to convince the airline crew to let us make an announcement. Standing up in front of the plane and giving our spiel was honestly terrifying. However, an ovation and questions from passengers probably means it went ok. It went so ok in fact that one group on board are currently trying to see if they can bring us along and get us even further.\r\n\r\nTime to take a quick pic with the Captain, don't want to fall too behind on the Gumball Challange.\r\n\r\n<strong>14:00</strong>\r\n\r\nKilmainheim jail was buzzing with excitment and goodwill, an incredible setting worthy of the task before us. Spirits couldn't help but be high as Jack Cantillion gave a rousing speech, repeating how much craic the The Jailbreak Rat Snapchat race would be. With the clock ticking towards nine, the Jailbreakers counted from ten. At 0 we were out the door, sprinting, this is after all a race (sort of).\r\n\r\nOutside, our chariot awaited us. The very kind people at Cadburys Creme Egg and Eco Cabs hooked us up with their best rider, 'Muc', who made the distance from Kilmainheim to Connolly in record time. The ride down the quays really showed the type of experience that jailbreak is. As we hung out of the Eco cab the bus behind us was filled with Jailbreakers beeping and shouting, as the two lads who are sailing to Wales nipped by in their bikes. We made it to Connolly in plenty of time, where we grabbed our tickets which someone had kindly left for us.\r\n\r\nCurrently just passed Lisburn, we know the next step but I'll keep you in suspense. We've collected enough money for it anyway and people are really interested in it. Advice for all you Jailbreakers out there, get talking to people, they want to hear about it! The extent of peoples generousity is definitely the most striking thing about #Jailbreak14 so far.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/1924698_736185469727770_467547716_n.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24452", "Heading": "Jailbreaking - An On-the-Ground Blog"}
