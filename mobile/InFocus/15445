From 1922 until 1938 the family of the republican\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Harry Boland had stored the jewels in their Marino Crescent home.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Eamonn De Valera revealed in a speech at Youghal in January 1948 that a deal brokered in\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">the United States between Irish emissaries and Soviet representatives had led\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">to the jewels making their way to Ireland. In 1920, with a civil war in Russia\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">and cases of famine and disease caused by a radical change of power the newly\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">founded Soviet state was in need of financial support. Representatives of the\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Soviet government had managed to smuggle Russian jewels, looted from the\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">palaces of the overthrown monarchy, into the United States.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">As figures such as Trotsky and De Valera progressed through the same US speaking circuits\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">representatives of both newly founded governments began to mingle. De Valera\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">stated, after being questioned by a rival election candidate about the events,\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">that \u0421we were in the USA, seeking recognition for the Republic set up here after\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">the elections of 1918. At the same time there was also a representative of the\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Russian government of that day\u0415 He found it difficult to get American money\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">and a loan was given to him by the Irish mission. In security for the loan certain\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">articles of jewellery were given up by him.\u0422 The \u0421certain articles of jewellery\u0422\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">referenced by De Valera were a 16-carat diamond and three sapphire and ruby\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">broaches. Ludovic Martens, the Soviet representative, certified that they had\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">once belonged to the Tsar and his family.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">De Valera was further questioned in 1948 about whether the loan had been repaid, to which he replied \u0421No\u0422 and implied that the jewels had been in the safe keeping of a private individual until\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">1938, when they were handed over to the newly elected Fianna Fail government.\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">When the jewels made their way from the United States to Ireland they were\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">brought by the man who brokered the deal, Harry Boland. Boland transferred\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">the jewels to the Minister for Finance, Michael Collins. At first it was unclear\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">how the jewels had been once more placed into the possession of Boland but\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Dublin Castle papers disclosed in the early 1980s grant a greater insight into\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">the incident. On January 6th 1922, the day before the treaty debates, Collins\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">and Boland met in private and got into an impassioned argument regarding\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">the treaty. Collins is said to have thrown the Jewels back across the table to\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Boland saying \u0421Take them to hell out of that, they\u0422re blood-stained anyway.\u0422</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Harry Boland opposed the treaty and was later fatally wounded by government\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">forces in a bungled hotel raid in 1922. Before he succumbed to his wounds he\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">left instructions to his sister Kathleen. He asked that she and his mother keep\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">the jewels until a party was in power that intended to establish a united Ireland.\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Thus, in 1922, the jewels made their way to No. 15 Marino crescent, formerly the\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">home of Bram Stoker.</span></p>\n\u0430<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In 1938 Eamonn De Valera took the oath he had fought a civil war to resist and took power with his party Fianna Fail. His secretary at this point was Gerry Boland, brother of Harry. With a party in power that the Boland family could trust to realise their late brother\u0422s dream of an Irish republic, the jewels were offered back to the Da\u044dl, who accepted them. The loan had never\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">been repaid and it was decided that the jewels should be transferred to the Bank\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">of Ireland strong room where they remained until September 1949.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After the Youghal speech in 1948 at which De Valera revealed the tale of the\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Jewels\u0422 time in Ireland the public became interested in seeing a final outcome\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">to the story and sought knowledge of where the jewels were. The government\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">considered putting the jewels up for public auction. However, valuations made in</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Ireland and at Christy\u0422s auction house in London advised the government that\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">they would be fortunate to receive more than the equivalent of \u04332000 for the\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">jewels. For four months the Irish government pursued the Russian government\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">via the Soviet ambassador regarding the jewels receiving no answer.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On July 30th of 1948 the Soviet ambassador was advised that should the loan not be repaid\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">in full then the Irish government would attempt \u0421to recover the amount of the\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">advance \u0426 or as much as it may be possible \u0426 by disposing of the security.\u0422 On\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">August 9th the soviet state replied to the threat via their ambassador in London,\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">noting that \u0421although this transaction has not been done in the proper way\u0422 the\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">USSR would repay the full amount of the loan, without interest, in exchange for\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">the jewels\u0422 return. In 1950 the Russian Jewels made their way back to Russia and\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Fianna Fail put an end to a minor political embarrassment and a curious piece of\u0430</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Irish history.</span>", "Imageurl": "15446", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15445", "Heading": "Selling the Family Silver"}
