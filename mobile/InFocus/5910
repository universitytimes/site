{"Body": "<strong>Rachel Lavin</strong>\n<em>Online Magazine Editor</em>\n\nI know, I know, it&rsquo;s hard being a focking legend all the focking time. And Halloween is just another obstacle for you to overcome on your rise to becoming totally focking awesome. But fear not, here are a few quick simple steps to ensure that this Halloween you will catapult yourself to instant legendary status, and imprint your existence on Trinity folklore forever, through a series of repulsive, offensive and distasteful costumes. Who knows, they might name a lecture theatre after you, make you a scholar of the focking banter or even dedicate a facebook appreciation page to you for being such a True Lad (one you didn&rsquo;t even have to create yourself.)\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5911\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5911\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-5911\" title=\"gaddafi\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/gaddafi-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"430\" height=\"323\" /></a></p>\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #9f4195; font-weight: bold;\">\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Muammar Gadaffi</span>\n\nWhat you will need:\n<ul>\n<li>A Green Book you swear by.</li>\n<li>Well you can get rid of your Hitler costume for starters, there&rsquo;s a new evil dead dictator in town. Yay for you!</li>\n<li>Carry an umbrella that you can ramble incoherently to yourself under.</li>\n<li>Female Bodyguards.</li>\n<li>Costume choices are highly varied, but you can just fling a sheet over your shoulder and sure, slap on the tan. Wear anything that looks vaguely middle-eastern to you, you know like Aladdin.</li>\n<li>Use an accent that sounds vaguely Arabian to you, you know, like Borat.</li>\n<li>You can alternate the idea to include other Arab dictators too! Sure get a group together! Try Ben Ali or Hosni Mubaraq whichever tickles your fancy. But don&rsquo;t stop there, take out your trusty Osama Bin Ladin costume from all the way back in 2001! Topical, creative and resourceful? You&rsquo;re an all-round funny top-guy, saving the planet too, one recycled distasteful costume at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=5912\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-5912\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5912\" title=\"05_Flatbed_WEB - JULY\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/alg_resize_jersey-shore.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"296\" /></a></p>\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0<span style=\"color: #9f4195;\">2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The &lsquo;Joisy Showa&rsquo;</span></span>\n\nWhat you will need:\n<ul>\n<li>Sally Hansen, a few cans.</li>\n<li>Hairspray, a few cans.</li>\n<li>Ill-fitting tacky clothes-I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to try Henry Street.</li>\n<li>An irritating accent, accentuated by your terrible impression and embellished with constant out of context use of buzz words in ordinary conversation like &lsquo;smush&rsquo;, &lsquo;get it in&rsquo;, &lsquo;cabs aw heaya&rsquo; &lsquo;t-shirt tiiime&rsquo; and occasionally shouting &lsquo;SITUATION&rsquo; as you stroke your fake-tan contoured six-pack.</li>\n<li>If you feel you&rsquo;re better at English accents why not try the &lsquo;Geordie Shore&rsquo;, or even closer to home &lsquo;Hardy Bucks&rsquo;.</li>\n<li>In fact screw glamourized television, just dress like your local friendly neighborhood knacker.
