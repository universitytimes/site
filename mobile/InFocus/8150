Speaking about this new album, Orlando Weeks (lead vocals) stated that &ldquo;&rsquo;Given to the Wild' is the first line on the album and was a title idea we had pretty early on. But it wasn't until we'd finished recording that we could come back to it and know that it suited.&rdquo; Weeks&rsquo; words are true to the point that this LP is a journey into the wilderness of genre-spanning rock compared to previous works: A feat that has been pulled off admirably by the London fivesome.\n\nThe aforementioned opening track &lsquo;<strong>Child</strong>&rsquo; sets out the Maccabees&rsquo; stall as a musically progressing act. Different elements are introduced throughout the track periodically, including a brass intrusion and a consummate synth line towards the tail end. Weeks <em>et al</em> give the listener an introduction to the novel expansions in the band&rsquo;s sound set to continue throughout GTTW.\n\nWhat the Maccabees have done on this record is master the art of song structure and its subsequent execution. The best tracks on this album are deemed so by the attention to atmosphere creation and escalation. &lsquo;<strong>Feel To Follow&rsquo;</strong>, a James Blake-y affair of auto-tuned intermittent vocals and minimalist drum beats evolves into an upbeat sonic affirmation of life, made up of frenzied synths and guitars at its climax. &lsquo;<strong>Heave</strong>&rsquo; is a marvellous track that employs this bait and switch method of song-writing. In this song, Weeks ponders &lsquo;Are we so different?&rsquo; mournfully over a slow instrumental piece. Throughout the track constant new paradigms are introduced; energetic drumbeats, subtle strings, and blaring organs that would be befitting of a gothic cathedral. Each track on this album almost emulates the passage of time in The Maccabees career and musical influences in itself.\n\nThere&rsquo;s no need for catchy hooks or sing-along anthems when a band can build this sort of anticipation and still fulfil all expectations. This attention to song architecture ensures this album will translate seamlessly into live performances.\n\n&lsquo;<strong>Go</strong>&rsquo;, employing a beautiful guitar siren song riff, envelopes the listener and acts as an anchor, as once again the track builds in volume and intricacy to the auditory mastery that Maccabees have attained.\n\nGTTW can be seen to be influenced by the works of many &lsquo;disparate musical peers&rsquo;, as stated by the band, such as David Bowie, The Stone Roses and Kate Bush. Listening hard enough can throw up comparisons with even more wide-ranging acts, but rest assured, this is a stand-alone, exemplary piece.", "Imageurl": "8151", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8150", "Heading": "Given To The Wild &ndash; The Maccabees "}
