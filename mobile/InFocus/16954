My name is Laura Mc Loughlin and I am a very proud and lucky winner of a fully funded EIL Travel Award, which provided me with the opportunity to volunteer abroad and experience a new, different and diverse culture. Yes you read that right, fully funded!\n\nSince receiving the amazing news back in April, my poor brain had been working overtime trying to process the brilliant news which seemed to good to be true. The days of day dreaming about volunteering in Mexico have now been replaced by real experiences, which I hope to share with interested and likeminded people.\n\nAfter weeks of anticipation, excitement and scary 'what-if's', it is hard to believe I have been living happily in Mexico for four weeks already! Although the time has flown by, it is safe to say that I have already experienced and created enough memories to last me a lifetime. \n<blockquote>\nWhen I arrived in Mexico I had no Spanish and therefore could not string a sentence together. Despite the potential language barrier, lack of communication has not been a problem. My charades skills have improved immensely since I got here. There is more than one way to skin a cat you know!</blockquote>\nSeriously, it is amazing how quickly you can pick up a language if you really want to or have to, you decide. I am by no means fluent. However, it never ceases to amaze me when I realize I have just understood a conversation that took place in Spanish.\n\nIf you are considering embarking on a similar adventure and are worried about not speaking the language, my advice would be just go for it and don't let language be an obstacle. I spent a brilliant two weeks learning the basics of the language and taking part in cultural activities at the Instituto Cultural Oaxaca, which offer classes in cooking, salsa dancing and ceramics along side the morning Spanish classes.\n\nThe classes were excellent. The institute also provided me with a great opportunity to meet lots of really nice people and make friends with people from different parts of the world. \n\nOne of the first things that struck me when I arrived in Mexico besides the beautiful scenic sights of Mexico City and Oaxaca was the warm and friendly manner of the people. Friendly, affectionate, funny, warm and helpful are a few words that spring to mind when I think of Mexican people. I have been extremely fortunate to have encountered so many nice people since arriving.\n<br /><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130730-110159.jpg\"><img src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130730-110159.jpg\" alt=\"20130730-110159.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a>\nRight now I am living with a lovely host family in Oaxaca. Living with a Mexican family has really enhanced my experience and enabled me to gain a real insight into Mexican culture, in which family plays a core role. I have been warmly welcomed into the family and even gained two more sisters, Amy and Zuri!\n \nJust when I thought things could not get any better I began my volunteering as an English teacher at Fundaci\u00f3n Kinich. Fundaci\u00f3n Kinich is a community centre for the local children and adults, in which they take part in a range of classes from English, maths, nutrition, computers, physical education, art, dance, sport, family and children's therapy.\n\nI am currently working with children ranging from the age of 4 to 14, teaching  English and helping with the range of activities mentioned above. I also hold some English classes for the teachers at Kinich.\n\nI am really enjoying my time at Fundaci\u00f3n Kinich. From the moment I started the children and staff have been so lovely.\n<blockquote>\nMy first day volunteering I was warmly welcomed by the children who picked me flowers and greeted me with hugs and kind words.</blockquote>\nThe children's enthusiasm, curiosity and eagerness to learn is both energizing and contagious. This enthusiasm and eagerness to learn is obvious everyday when I am met by a group of curious children who have taken time out of their lunch break to come and ask \"teacher how do you say this word in English.\"\n\nI can't thank Eil enough for giving me this incredible opportunity. I am really enjoying every moment and making the most of  the experience. I know I won't forget my time here in beautiful Oaxaca. My second piece of advice to anyone reading this blog would be don't just take my word for it go and experience it for yourself, you won't regret it.\n\nIf your interested in finding out more about my experiences you can follow my blogs which will feature on  www.eilireland.org and  www.spunout.ie or you can follow me on twitter @90_laura.\n\nFor further information about Eil volunteering opportunities you can visited Eil intercultural learning at www.eilireland.org or www.volunteerabroad.ie<br /><br /><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130730-110237.jpg\"><img src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130730-110237.jpg\" alt=\"20130730-110237.jpg\" class=\"alignnone size-full\" /></a><br />", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/20130730-110140.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "16954", "Heading": "The Mexico Diaries"}
