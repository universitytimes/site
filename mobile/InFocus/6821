In my opinion, many of us are losing the ability to make friends of our own accord, and we rarely meet peers whom we know nothing about, as we have probably already &ldquo;stalked out&rdquo; their social networking profiles.\u00a0\u00a0 We know who people are friends with, what clubs they&rsquo;ve been in, where they spent the summer, and what bands they&rsquo;ve seen.\u00a0 We know all about their families, ages, occupations and interests.\u00a0 Our lives are laced with the pretense of our online identities, an Internet personality we have constructed, someone we strive to be but are often a thousand miles away from.\n\nForget the references you&rsquo;ve included on your CV, your social networking site is the most reliable reference of all, and the daunting truth of the situation is that potential employers know this, and are consulting these websites on a daily basis.\u00a0 A survey by careerbuilders.com in the U.S. recently revealed that 45 percent of employers used social network sites to research job candidates.\u00a0 Your unsavoury photographs could be preventing you from being hired, or worse again, could be the cause of your redundancy.\u00a0 Take Brian Colvin, for example, an intern at Anglo-Irish Bank, who having alerted his employers of a family emergency to gain time off work, was later outed by his Facebook page when pictures appeared of him attending a Halloween party at the time, or the Las Vegas school teacher who lost his job at a Catholic school after declaring himself a homosexual on his MySpace page.\u00a0 In a bid to alert America&rsquo;s youth of the perils of careless social networking, President Obama stated: \"I want everybody here to be careful about what you post on Facebook, because in the YouTube age whatever you do, it will be pulled up again later somewhere in your life and when you're young, you know, you make mistakes and you do some stupid stuff.\u00a0 I've been hearing a lot about young people who, you know, they're posting stuff on Facebook, and then suddenly they go apply for a job, and somebody has done a search.\"\u00a0 Do we really want our employers, or potential employers, for that matter, perusing our personal photographs?\u00a0 Of course we don&rsquo;t.\u00a0 Sure, these pages are safe if you&rsquo;ve activated the correct privacy settings, but many who have not risk being found out.\u00a0 Would you email your boss a picture of yourself at the end of a night out? Didn&rsquo;t think so.\u00a0 But the fact is that your drunken antics as a teenager could come back to haunt you in later years when you enter the job market.\n\nUnless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock for the last ten years, you&rsquo;ve heard tales of woe regarding the dangers of social networking sites, particularly, but certainly not exclusively, when in use by young children.\u00a0 The age that children begin to start making use of social networking seems to be becoming younger and younger.\u00a0 Now, twelve and thirteen year olds are surfing the Internet freely, and are, unbeknownst to many of their parents, leaving themselves wide open to hazards like pedophiles and cyber bullying.\u00a0 According to Fox News, as many as 7.5 million children under the age of thirteen are using Facebook and many of them are unaware of the dangers, adding information such as their addresses and mobile phone numbers to their profiles, along with suggestive photographs and inappropriate comments and status updates.\u00a0 Facebook have a policy whereby under-thirteens are not allowed to use the site, but with the click of a mouse, a child can easily claim to be a year or two older.\u00a0 Facebook is an easily accessible platform for stalkers, rapists and pedophiles and these offenders are using social networking sites every single day, often posing as teenagers and using fake profiles to lure in young girls.\u00a0 Social networking sites can also pose a serious risk to adults, however.\u00a0 Take, for example, the case of Sarah Richardson of Staffordshire, England.\u00a0 A woman who had just left her husband, Richardson changed her relationship status from &lsquo;married&rsquo; to &lsquo;single&rsquo; on her Facebook profile, igniting her husband&rsquo;s rage and inspiring him to track her down and stab her to death at her parents home.\n\nFacebook-ing is an undeniably unhealthy addiction for a number of reasons.\u00a0 It promotes paranoia and consumes precious time that could be spent doing something worthwhile, like exercising, studying or spending time with family.\u00a0 However, would we live without Facebook?\u00a0 Probably not.", "Imageurl": "6822", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6821", "Heading": "Is Facebook Ruining Your Life?"}
