{"Body": "<h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Note: Thanks to Dervla in the comments section it's been pointed out that the Moto G is coming to Meteor! Yay! Best value phone ever by a country mile.</h5>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Contract Details</h2>\n<h2>Pre Pay vs Bill Pay</h2>\n<span style=\"font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.6;\">These are all Pre Pay prices because that's what's easy to compare. Bill Pay is a way to spread payments and pay more in the long run always but we usually need to spread payments if we're spending half a grand. If you can buy it in one go and you don't you're conning yourself into thinking you're spending less money, you are spending far far more.\u00a0</span>\n<h2>Insurance</h2>\r\nIt's all the rage because it's free money for the insurers. The cost vs risk doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\nEg. If I buy a new Galaxy S4, ~600 quid, no insurance and it breaks after 8 months. To replace it I will probably have to pay ~80-100 quid charge after paying ~80-100 already in insurance premiums. While a second hand mint condition one now cost 250-300~ anyway. And that only happens in about 1/5 cases anyway.\r\n\r\nDoesn't add up.\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Short Price Guide</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&lt;&euro;150 : Buy the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2gcU6lM0ps\">Lumia 520</a>/620 above all competition.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&euro;150-&euro;250 : Buy the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kw--JowX6s\">Sony Xperia M</a> in Ireland or the Moto G if you can buy abroad.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&euro;250-500 : Buy the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLOyVb1Bm9k\">HTC One mini</a>. That's all.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&gt;&euro;450 : Buy the HTC One/IPhone 5s instead of Galaxy S4, Sony Z1 and Iphone 5c. Depends if you like Apple and can swallow the extra cost which one you get.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Long Price Guide</h1>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Cheap and Cheerful &euro;&lt;150</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Windows Phones are the best for the really cheap smartphones as they run very smooth on low cost. They also format documents perfectly if that's your thing. you won't get all the apps but you will get decent performance for next to nothing. Try the <strong>Nokia Lumia 520/620</strong>. Basically similar just one is as better as you'd expect 50 quid more would be.</p>\r\nAlso get's my vote for best cheap smartphone for the technologically inept. Nice and big graphics and very samey apps make navigation simple enough.\r\n<h2>Great Value &euro;150-250</h2>\r\nIn this tier there's only one real competitor. Sony have been churning out great mid range phones for a few years now and this season is no different with the <strong>Sony Xperia M</strong> beating all competition for the best value at any price point in Ireland.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There actually is one competitor that beats it handily. The <strong>Moto G</strong>, however for some awful reason no-one in Ireland is carrying it. If you can get it abroad do, it is better than any phone under &euro;400 at a price about &euro;180. A travesty no one in Ireland is selling it.\r\n<h2>Best Compromise &euro;250-500</h2>\r\nThere should be great competition at this price point... But there isn't, get the <strong>HTC One mini,</strong> at &euro;420 is a great phone at a big price, at this stage you might be considering Bill Pay. Don't get... The <strong>IPhone 5c</strong> unless you've too much money and like Apple, and even then just get the <strong>5s</strong>, at &euro;650+ is much better value, and that's saying something.\r\n<h2>Break the Bank (in a good way) &euro;500+</h2>\r\nTwo phones here and I have no great opinion on the difference, except price.\r\n\r\n<strong>HTC One </strong>, best speakers ever in a phone, great screen, power and beautiful metal body. All okay-ish priced at 579ish. Better than <strong>Samsung S4</strong> for everything by miles but the camera. If you do loads of serious outdoor photography get the S4, for everything else the HTC.\r\n\r\n<strong><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"IPhone 5\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Iphone 5s</a> </strong>if you like Apple get this, got the cool finger print thing, simplistic software and that lovely metal body. Astronomically priced at &euro;650+ but the updated software looks really nice and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.\r\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0Category Winners</h1>\n<h5>This is the best individual features notwithstanding any other parts of the phone, follow at your peril.</h5>\r\nBest Camera (41 mega-pixels, and it makes a difference) : <strong>Nokia Lumia 1520</strong>\r\n\r\nMost Portable : <strong><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"iPhone\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">IPhones</a></strong>\r\n\r\nLook it's a fucking Underwater Camera! : <strong>Sony Z1</strong>\r\n\r\nWorst value (of the famous ones) : <strong>Galaxy S4 mini</strong>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: center;\">Pointless Mini-Rant</h1>\r\nThe best value in the world is easily the Moto G, but for some reason beyond my logic the tragically uncompetitive Irish smartphone market doesn't have it. It was confirmed that it is available to them but frankly I think it's too good value and would stop people buying anything above it (at &euro;190) but the top range &euro;600 phones, it's that good value.\r\n\r\nI weep.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/homescreenwars.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22548", "Heading": "Christmas Smartphone Shopping guide"}
