A very chilled out evening in the Parlour with TrinityFM &ndash; and all for a good cause.\u00a0 On Friday the 28<sup>th</sup> of October, to embrace the Hallowe&rsquo;en season, Trinity FM teamed up with the Parlour to organise The Hallow Sessions, an acoustic festival in aid of the children of Somalia that ran from 2pm until 8pm.\n\nThere may have been dreary weather outside but emotions were positive inside the Goldsmith Hall. It was all kicked off by Anne Nuding singing beautifully while accompanied by Robbie Kitt on guitar.\u00a0 This was closely followed by a set from the incredibly talented Claire Hyland and Aisling O&rsquo; Leary, Paddy Dexter and Craig Reynolds &ndash; who sang everything from the Cranberries to Lady Gaga to original songs, giving the crowd a warming taste of diversity despite the gloomy conditions beyond the walls.\n\nDU Food and Drink were on hand to get everyone in a festive Hallowe&rsquo;en mood, organising a pumpkin carving competition, with predictably messy, yet creative results. Within five minutes there was a crowd of students perfecting their spooky creations and creating a surreal atmosphere by lining them up along the window-sill.\n\nUnderlying this relaxed music session was a serious message. At 5pm, Barney, a representative from UNICEF arrived and after a short video on the famine in East Africa, talked to everyone about why we need to step out of our comfort zones, step out of our college life, step out of Ireland and look at issues that are happening across the world. The events that we all dread to talk about and, even worse, fail to pay any attention to. The images that we were watching were not a tale being told from far away but a reality for millions of people, for children, for people our age. The biggest thing that was learnt from Barney was that organisations aren&rsquo;t just looking for money from people to send off, but to raise awareness among young people by organising talks or volunteer talks or even by simply bringing the harrowing nature of life in the Third World up in conversation. The need to give thought and a human identity to the victims of suffering was foremost in the thoughts of the crowd assembled.\n\nThe festival continued into the evening with soothing sounds from the acoustic duet Kaleidofolk and solo artist Tim Nairn (already on a lucky streak having won TrinityFM&rsquo;s Digitalism tickets the day before), strong vocal harmonies from Stephen and Colm O&rsquo; Loughlin and haunting sounds from Cloud Castle Lake, accompanied by a cellist.\n\nTrinityFM and the Parlour succeeded in having a chilled-out event that was thoroughly enjoyed by all. The Parlour, organised by Sarah Mulcahy, Michelle Hanley and Niall Morahan, is a phenomenal event. They have created a space for students to hang out, relax and just enjoy themselves. They have had Trinity Orchestra play Arcade Fire, fashion days, movie nights and acoustic sets and they are continuing to have events every Friday so it is highly recommended that you check them out. Arts Block students that have ignored the Hamilton side of college before now are invited to come along, with top class staff and prices at the JCR cafe; it&rsquo;s something that should not be missed.\n\n<em>TrinityFM will be having plenty more acoustic sessions and events coming to a venue near you, so keep an eye out on Facebook and on the website.
