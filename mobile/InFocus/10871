The optimism that filled most Irish fans prior to the fixture was a distant memory after the class of the Croatian team was imposed on the significantly weaker Irish outfit. This game had been targeted by Ireland as one of the matches where a result could have been achieved and now they face a near impossible task of getting out of the group.\n\nTrapattoni started with his tried and tested team of 4-4-2 which had been announced earlier in the week. Croatia too started with what appeared to be a 4-4-2 formation but in truth the trio of Perisic, Rakitic and especially Modric interchanged positions constantly as opposed to the rigid nature of the Irish team. The match in Poznan was played on a slick pitch which certainly favoured the intricate, one-touch passing style of the Croatians.\n\nIreland got off to a terrible start by going behind to a Mario Mandzukic header. A cross into the box deflected to Mandzukic who steered his header into the bottom left hand corner of the net just out of the reach of Shay Given. However Ireland reacted very well to going behind. They kept the ball well in their own half, without doing much with it in Croatia&rsquo;s half. With the lack of attacking promise it became clear that Ireland&rsquo;s best chance of scoring a goal would come from a set piece. With no corner&rsquo;s to speak of for the first 80 minutes, a free-kick provided Ireland&rsquo;s outlet. McGeady whipped in a good ball to the back post where St. Ledger outmuscled Corluka and powered in a header past Pletikosa. 1-1, game on!\n\nHowever, this goal seemed to stir Croatia into life and they began to exert pressure on Ireland with two quick chances. Rakitic drove a firm shot a few yards wide and then Perisic tested Given with a firm volley which he palmed away. The beginning of Croatia&rsquo;s dominance occurred with Modric coming into the game. He began to pop up in the holes between the midfield and the defence of Ireland linking Croatia&rsquo;s play. During this time he found space at the edge of the Irish box to curl in a good shot, however it straight at Given.\n\nAt this point Ireland needed to hold on until half time and go in level. Perisic again took another volley after a good flick from Jelavic only to see it fly a few yards wide. The Croatian defence had now started to deal with the hustle and bustle of Doyle up front which removed any threat the Irish team had, inviting the Croatians to attack further. The Irish defence however dealt with everything that was thrown at it, not allowing the Croatians a clear chance inside the box. Minutes prior to half-time a lapse in concentration from Glen Whelan invited the Croatians forward.\u00a0 Following a cross the ball was cleared out to Modric who scuffed a shot. Stephen Ward attempted to clear the ball but only contrived to slice the ball into the direction of Jelavic, who as we saw with Everton over the latter half of the season, is well capable of finishing. However the Irish did have a right to feel aggrieved, because in his effort to clear the ball Ward was clipped by Mandzukic&rsquo;s foot causing him to miscue. In fairness to the referee though, he would have been hard pressed to notice this in real time. The match went into the break at 2-1 in favour of the Croats.\n\nAfter the restart the match continued in the same vein as before with Croatia dictating the play. The third goal arrived soon after. Ireland&rsquo;s defence which prior to this match had kept 11 clean sheets in 14 games were particularly poor for this goal. Due to a lack of pressure from Ireland Perisic was able to pick out Mandzukic in the box who, under no great pressure, headed the ball goalwards. The ball rebounded off the post and unluckily hit Given who had dived to attempt to save it. This goal seemed to stun the Irish team further and they were unable to create anything against the Croats.\n\nTrapattoni responded early by bringing on Jon Walters and Simon Cox for Kevin Doyle and Aidan McGeady. This seemed a strange move by Trapattoni as Cox, a centre forward, was played out on the wing while on the bench remained two wingers in Stephen Hunt and James McClean both of whom could have injected some much needed urgency into the Irish team. The substitutes didn&rsquo;t have any real influence as Croatia continued to dominate.\n\nOut of nothing Ireland should have had a penalty when Keane was brought down in the box by Schildenfeld with a clumsy tackle from behind. The referee however remained unmoved. The match then seemed to peter out a bit with a shot by Rakitic flying inches wide after a lay-off by the ever impressive Srna, who was arguably the game&rsquo;s best player. Trappatoni brought Long on for Keane but in truth, again, this did little to remedy the problem at hand as the service to the strikers was non-existent. Keith Andrews driving on from midfield had a few half chances and probably should have done better in injury time with an unmarked header in injury time which flew inches wide but by that stage the game was up.\n\nIreland now have an uphill battle to get anything from the championships with matches against world champions Spain and a somewhat resurgent Italy ahead. To stand any chance of getting through Ireland need to pick up at least 4 points, a task which could prove virtually impossible. If they are to have any chance at all, they must cut out the mistakes that gave Croatia their main chances, and must somehow become more pressing up front. If this can't be done, then the Euro dream may come to a very abrupt conclusion\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Italy 1 -1 Spain</strong><strong></strong>\n\nIn the earlier Group C game, the crowd were offered the tantalising prospect of Spain and Italy coming to blows This match pitched the last two world champions against each other and the match turned out to be a pulsating affair. Italy lined up in a 3-5-2 formation with Daniele de Rossi dropping to centre-half due to injuries. Balotelli started up front alongside the unpredictable of Antonio Cassano, who had recovered from heart surgery earlier on in the season with A.C. Milan. Pirlo would pull the strings from midfield. Spain lined out with what could be described as a 4-6-0 formation, very much akin to the formation which Barcelona play with, utilising a false number nine in Fabregas or Silva. With the absence of a recognised striker it was clear that Spain as ever were going to try and break down Italy with their short passing game.\n\nFrom the offset the game was played at a thrilling pace with both teams seeing plenty of the ball. Spain however, with their very methodical build up were struggling to break down the Italians. Their best opportunities came from David Silva with a strike from outside the box which went over and a shot straight at Buffon.\n\nItaly however were creating chances, exposing the weaknesses of the makeshift back four of Spain clearly missing the talismanic figure of Puyol. The excellent Pirlo first tested Casillas with a swerving free kick down to the keeper&rsquo;s right. Then Claudio Marchisio of Juventus connected with an excellent volley and was desperately unlucky for it to go straight at Casillas. Italy again threatened prior to half time with a header from the Brazilian born Thiago Motta, but their attempts were foiled by a good save by Casillas.\n\nAt the beginning of the second half Buffon, who hadn&rsquo;t seen much work up to now, showed why he is still considered a great keeper by saving from both Iniesta and Fabregas. The first save from Iniesta was from an acute angle but he still needed to get his fingers to the ball to push the shot wide. The second was from a well struck shot by Fabregas from the edge of the box.\n\nItaly threatened when Balotelli dispossessed Ramos easily and headed towards goal. He however seemed in two minds and wasted a golden chance as Ramos got back. He was quickly substituted as Udinese hero Antonio di Natale was brought on and had an instant impact, scoring for Italy in the 61<sup>st</sup> minute. Pirlo burst forward from midfield and threaded through a lovely pass for di Natale to curl past the onrushing Casillas. Spain however hit back three minutes later with an equally good goal with the ever inventive David Silva slipping in Fabregas to finish low and hard past Buffon. After a few minutes of madness, the game settled down to a resigned conclusion\n\nTowards the end Torres had a few gilt-edged chances to finish off the game when he had the opportunity to lob Buffon who had been caught in no man&rsquo;s land. On this occasion he lifted the ball a yard over the bar. Marchisio, who had been the epitome of dynamism, in the Italian midfield also had a chance late on, only to fire his shot after a good run straight at Casillas.\n\nA draw was a fair result in a match that saw both teams go at it for 90 minutes and it leaves both sides still in a strong position to exit from the group.", "Imageurl": "10872", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10871", "Heading": "Euro 2012: Ireland Sunk by Croatia"}
