One so mind-blowingly over-the-top, it defies whatever expected bar you set for its possible ridiculousness, and by the end of it, you&rsquo;re just along to see where in the world the writers are going to take you? If so, you&rsquo;re in for a fun time. <em>Asura&rsquo;s Wrath</em> is a strange phenomenon, coming out of <em>CyberConnect2</em>, a company previously known for various <em>.hack</em> and <em>Naruto</em> games, so their pedigree for anime games is well established.\n\nThe game opens with the titular character, Asura, leaping from a spaceship in order to punch\u00a0a planet in the face - it\u00a0only gets more absurd and ludicrous from that point on. By the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll have punched a handful of gods square in the face, caused a fistful of cataclysms, and dealt with at least\u00a0two or\u00a0three &ldquo;end of the world&rdquo; scenarios. The game itself is played through a series of episodes over a course of chapters, inheriting this from its anime stylings (even going so far as to include a &ldquo;Previously/Next time on&rdquo; set of segments). The gameplay\u00a0is mostly concerned with quick time event based events, where the failure or success of the QTE does not affect the overall outcome of the game (apart from your end game score).\u00a0There are also\u00a0some minor battle sequences. While some of the battles are challenging, the thrill of the game lies in the manic lengths that the game goes to without the player&rsquo;s consent; fighting giant mutant elephants, getting poked by fingers the size of mountain ranges, spending a good portion of the game with either far too many or far too few arms, and finally the QTE and combat ending action of &lsquo;Burst&rsquo; activation, which\u00a0causes something awesome to happen.\n\nAsura&rsquo;s Wrath is by no means a perfect game. There are repeated boss battles in some sections, the battle sequences can get rather tiresome after a while, and the game is rather brief. On the other hand, it doesn&rsquo;t outstay its welcome, and if the idea of the game even mildly interests you, it can be a very enjoyable ride. A word of warning though; the game inherits another painful piece of its anime style, in that the &ldquo;True&rdquo; ending for the game is sold as DLC. The game itself is still a complete experience without it, but the DLC ending actually contains the most fun sections of the game and some of the best visuals. This might disgust some people, but if it doesn&rsquo;t, you might enjoy one of the more unique intellectual properties to come out in a while.\n\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Diablo III</span></strong>\n<div id=\"id.442216015796515\">\n\nSixteen\u00a0years ago, the town of Tristram had a portal to hell open up underneath it -\u00a0the Lord of Terror emerged, and was slain.\u00a0Twelve years ago, the three Prime Evils enacted their master plans, and were destroyed. And now, the shadow of evil rises again to threaten the world, in one of <em>Blizzard&rsquo;s</em> most anticipated releases, <em>Diablo 3</em>. Anyone who has\u00a0ever picked up the mantle to war against the forces of hell will probably be well versed in <em>Diablo</em>&rsquo;s high speed, action oriented RPG play style -\u00a0this involves a\u00a0high turnover of new and better items and impressive skills and\u00a0facing down ever increasing hordes of new monstrosities\u00a0,\u00a0all with a very deep story keeping everything coherent.\n\nThe visual team worked to create a distance with the darker screens of <em>Diablo 2</em>, but make no mistake; just because you can see better doesn&rsquo;t mean the horrors that crop up aren&rsquo;t as grotesque, they&rsquo;re just better lit. Many have criticised <em>D3</em> for its &ldquo;Always and Only Online&rdquo; play, even if trying to play the game as a single player experience - this was\u00a0due to some teething problems with servers reaching capacity rapidly, coupled with the troubling frequency of reports of account hacking. Even so,\u00a0the core game itself remains solid, and the teething issues are, for the most part, resolved at this point.\n\nThe game itself contains\u00a0four difficulty modes, with each beyond normal having a pair of requirements; reach a certain level in game and kill the final boss of the final act in your current difficulty, with the modes named Normal, Nightmare, Hell and Inferno. While players in higher modes can come back and help out lower level allies, one cannot join a game with a higher mode friend. There are also\u00a0five radically different character classes, each with a unique visual style and method of playing: the tanky Barbarian, the nimble Demon Hunter, the glass cannon Wizard, the powerful Monk and the bizarre Witch Doctor. Every one of these classes has a unique feel and look, with multiple play styles, which can be modified on the fly with tons of active and passive abilities.\u00a0There's\u00a0a twist, however -\u00a0you can only use\u00a0three passive and\u00a0six active at a time. While this may seem limiting, the &ldquo;runes&rdquo; you can use to modify your abilities, along with the range of classes and difficulties to play mean there&rsquo;s almost endless possibilities as to how you can enjoy the game.\n\n</div>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "10860", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "10852", "Heading": "Diablo III/Asura's Wrath - Review"}
