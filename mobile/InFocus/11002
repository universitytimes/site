He will have his work cut out this year though as he&rsquo;s been dealt a nightmare draw\u00a0for the tournament.\u00a0 He also comes into the tournament in terrible grass court form, losing in the first round at Queens Club and losing both of his other warm up games.\u00a0 He will begin his campaign today on centre court against former world number three, Nikolay Davydenko.\u00a0 Although Davydenko is far from his previous best he will still present a stiff challenge in the first round and is one of the toughest opponents Murray could have faced.\n\nIf Murray progresses to round two he will most likely face grass court specialist Ivo Karlovic, who has a very good record at the Championships.\u00a0 The 6&rsquo;10&rsquo;&rsquo; Croat has a good record on grass and reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon in 2009.\u00a0 Kevin Anderson is Murray&rsquo;s likely third round opponent, a man who took Thomas Berdych to five sets in the French Open last month and could provide another big test for Murray.\u00a0 Looking to the fourth round, Murray&rsquo;s likely opponent is Richard Gausquet and he could then face David Ferrer in the quarter final - a rematch of Murray&rsquo;s quarter in Paris.\u00a0 If Murray repeats his feat of reching the semi&rsquo;s, as he has done for the last three years, he will most likely face Nadal, the man who has beaten him in the last two Wimbledon semi-finals.\n\nNadal will arrive in London full of confidence after retaining his crown in Paris, 13 days earlier. By doing this he also avenged his defeat by Djokovic in the three previous grand slam finals and prevented Djokovic from holding all four grand slams at the one time.\u00a0 He would have been the first man to do this since Rod Laver back in 1969, where he completed a calendar grand slam.\u00a0 Nadal won 6-4 6-3 2-6 7-5 in a rain delayed final which was completed on the Monday.\u00a0 At one stage Djokovic won 8 games straight to take the match to a fourth set until it was suspended till Monday after Nadal&rsquo;s protests about the deteriorating weather conditions. \u00a0Although losing in the second round in Halle, Nadal will be fresh for Wimbledon and will be firm favourite to reach the final.\n\nDjokovic and Federer find themselves on the same side of the draw this year and both progressed comfortably to the second round yesterday.\u00a0 Federer was particularly impressive in his 6-1 6-1 6-1 demolition of Albert Ramos.\u00a0\u00a0 On the women&rsquo;s side, Sharapova advanced comfortably yesterday with a straight sets win as did Kim Clijsters and Anestasia Radwanska.\u00a0 Venus Williams was the big casualty on the ladies side, losing 6-1 6-3 to Elena Vesnina.", "Imageurl": "11004", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "11002", "Heading": "Waiting Game for Murray at Wimbledon"}
