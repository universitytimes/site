{"Body": "Jasper Plan\n\nFinancial issues as a student? Let me guess: it&rsquo;s the start of a new month, you&rsquo;re already out of money and can&rsquo;t afford to pay your bills and rent? Many of us face the problems caused by the infamous tight student budget. Keeping our expenses under control may seem difficult at first, but pursuing a self-regulated and well-managed strategy may help to prevent over-spending and careless investments.\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #0d0df1;\">(a) Budget</span></h3>\n<span style=\"color: #0d0df1;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/budget-analyst-career-guide1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2235\" title=\"budget-analyst-career-guide\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/budget-analyst-career-guide1-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a>\n</span>\n\nFirst of all, it is essential to know what you have and how you&rsquo;re spending it. Software programmes, such as Excel, can help us calculate monthly net incomes, expenses, as well as analyse our annual budget per month. I&rsquo;m not telling you to go on Excel immediately, but am rather underscoring the importance in jotting down your expenses to provide a sound insight towards your financial situation. You could try collecting all your receipts for a whole month in order to get a good idea of this.\n\nOnce this is done, you can focus on downsizing your costs. Look at each category separately, and notice the difference in the elasticity of each good. In other words, it is harder to squeeze money out of some goods than others which are higher up on the priority list.\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #00ff00;\">(b) Food</span></h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dispatches-the-true-cost-of-cheap-food-research_412x232.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2236\" title=\"dispatches-the-true-cost-of-cheap-food-research_412x232\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dispatches-the-true-cost-of-cheap-food-research_412x232-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" /></a>\n\nTake food and non-alcoholic drinks for example. You can achieve massive cuts in expenditure on these items, by sticking to Spar&rsquo;s &euro;3 chicken fillet rolls or supporting the Irish economy by living off Dunnes&rsquo; 2 for &euro;6 deals on meat. However, eventually you will reach a limit which can no longer be compressed. Transportation costs, on the other hand, can be cut completely. Instead of spending eighty euro per month on taking the bus to Trinity or around Dublin, why not walk? Or buy a bicycle? Not only is a bit of exercise healthy, but you will find that it lowers your costs as well.\n\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">(c) Day-to-Day</span></h3>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Mobile-Phones-and-Electromagnetic-Pollution.jpg\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-2237\" title=\"Mobile Phones and Electromagnetic Pollution\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Mobile-Phones-and-Electromagnetic-Pollution-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n\nThe reduction of other expenses, such as phone and utility bills, requires a reshaping of strategy. Instead of spending &euro;30 every month on your phone contract, spend &euro;20 on the pay-as-you-go mode which includes free texts (or calls to your network) for a whole month. Also, instead of using your own shower after visiting the gym, and thereby adding to personal utility costs, use Trinity&rsquo;s facilities. This also applies to books. Long reading lists affect all of us students. Yet, why buy the books when they are available in the library? If absolutely necessary, buy them from Amazon at cheaper prices or second-hand copies, which you can find on the &ldquo;noticeboard.&rdquo;\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #993366;\">(d) Nights Out</span></h3>\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20070205_drinkingteens_2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2239 alignright\" title=\"Italian Teenager daily life\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20070205_drinkingteens_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n</span>\n\nCareless investments are what you want to avoid. Investing in items which don&rsquo;t maximise utility and aren&rsquo;t high on the priority list painfully cut our budgets. For example, annual expenses on the morning coffee could add up to around &euro;500, or in other terms, a decent months income. The same idea can be applied to alcohol. Why buy expensive drinks at clubs, or order pricey pints at the pub? If you find it necessary to drink, do it at home before going out and buy the &ldquo;cheap stuff.&rdquo; Living off inferior goods is a key economic principle for people with lower incomes. Think twice before going to the supermarket: which one has the best offers and lowest prices?\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">(e) Banks</span></h3>\n<span style=\"color: #ff6600;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ANZ-Bank-counter.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2238 alignleft\" title=\"ANZ-Bank-counter\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ANZ-Bank-counter-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>\n</span>\n\nFurthermore, it is critical to be well informed about the student rates and policies of the various banks before choosing to stick to one. A lot of you might have chosen Bank or Ireland, for example, because of the free flight vouchers they would give you at the beginning of term. However, overdraft policy plays a big role in student banking. Go bank shopping. Find out how much money you are entitled to in your overdraft in order to prevent additional charges and fees. Ulster Bank, for example, has a standard student overdraft of &euro;650, which can be increased depending on which subject you study, whereas AIB offers a special 0% interest rate subject to a maximum of &euro;1500.\n\nOn the whole, saving money and reducing expenditure requires thorough planning and is most effective in the long run. Making changes to your lifestyle is essential in order to improve your savings.", "Imageurl": "2225", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2224", "Heading": "No money?
