Out gay performers in the hip hop world. \u00a0Who&rsquo;d a thunk it? But yeah, it&rsquo;s a thing. In a genre where homophobia is endemic, acceptance of queer culture has been somewhat slow. And why wouldn&rsquo;t it be? Rap and hip hop purport an exceedingly masculine image, and that hypermasculinity is at odds with so much of what makes up queer culture.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">In a genre where homophobia is endemic, acceptance of queer culture has been somewhat slow</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even in the past year or two, there have been numerous incidences of public homophobia from the hip hop corner. Chris Brown, the delight that he is, \u00a0(in reference to Frank Ocean coming out as bisexual) reportedly commented saying &lsquo;no homo&rsquo;. Earlier this year the rather tempestuous (catty) Azealia Banks, called Perez Hilton a &lsquo;messy faggot&rsquo;. I reckon she really should&rsquo;ve thought twice before lashing out at someone who can easily destroy a celebrity, should he feel the need. Perez gives as good as he gets. Claws definitely came out for that particular twitter spat.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/files/2012/07/frank.jpeg\" /></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most recent in this slew of homophobia was the controversy created by Eminem, by using the word &lsquo;faggot&rsquo; on his track Rap God. &ldquo;Break a motherfucker&rsquo;s table over the back of a couple faggots and crack it in half&rsquo;&rsquo;, to use the exact quote.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">&ldquo;Break a motherfucker&rsquo;s table over the back of a couple faggots and crack it in half&rsquo;&rsquo;</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sia, who collaborated on a track for Eminem&rsquo;s most recent record &lsquo;Marshall Mathers LPL 2&rsquo; has pledged to donate all the money from her collaboration to LGBT homeless youth, as a result of the controversy Eminem&rsquo;s use of the word caused. Interestingly, she herself identifies as queer.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While all this homophobic language is still rampant in hip hop, acceptance for queer artists in the hip hop world is becoming more commonplace. When Frank Ocean, whose Grammy award winning record Channel Orange shot him to fame last year, came out as bi-sexual, the hip hop world (Chris Brown aside) seemed to be supportive.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">it takes an amount of courage for a black RnB artist to come out as gay or bi-sexual</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cynics might say it was a clever PR move on Ocean&rsquo;s part to release his Tumblr post right as the album was coming out, with the amount of hype it caused. However, marketing ploy or no, it takes an amount of courage for a black RnB artist to come out as gay or bi-sexual. Rappers like Tyler The Creator, Jay-Z and others were vocal in their support. As the years have gone by, less stigma is attached to gay artists in the hip hop and rap worlds.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New York has been the stomping ground for the queer rap in the underground scene, and now the mainstream wants a piece of it. Here&rsquo;s a few artists that are breaking through:</p>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Mykki Blanco</h1>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mykki-Blanco.-Image-courtesy-of-Family.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22241\" alt=\"Mykki-Blanco.-Image-courtesy-of-Family\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Mykki-Blanco.-Image-courtesy-of-Family.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" /></a>\u00a0</span>\r\n\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/fadermedia/mykki-blanco-wavvy\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It&rsquo;s refreshing to see these voices break through a very macho, masculine world. And there&rsquo;s no tokenism here. The standard is high, the music is good. I&rsquo;ve seen Mykki Blanco perform twice in the last year, and as a huge hip hop fan, I was totally taken up with his performance but more struck with the feeling that I was watching something totally new, totally original.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">I was totally taken up with his performance but more struck with the feeling that I was watching something totally new, totally original</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I&rsquo;d never seen an explosive performance from a dude who came out on stage wearing no shirt, basketball shorts and pink lipstick. Drag and Rap are two art forms that really haven&rsquo;t had much to do with each other until now. And it&rsquo;s awesome.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mykki Blanco, real name Micheal Quattelbaum is a New York native who has turned the genre on it&rsquo;s a head a little. His explosive flow is aggressive and dynamic, drawing comparisons to Lil Wayne (before he drank so much sizzurp that his brain stopped working) but absolutely emphasises the juxtaposition between the standard rap bravado and those flamboyant, ultra feminine aesthetics in drag culture. Check out his track Wavvy.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">juxtaposition between the standard rap bravado and those flamboyant aesthetics in drag culture</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Total tune.

Now signed to Universal, her EP New York came out in October of last year and her anticipated debut album Dirty Gold is due out this coming January.With tracks like Werkin Girls and New York hitting six-figure play counts on youtube, and a major label behind her, hip hop is her&rsquo;s for the taking. With extraordinary lyrical skills, her mastery of rap is beyond her years. She spits in an explosive blur, with songs that usually recount her troubled background.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">The 22 year old has always been open about her sexuality, identifying as pansexual. She recently spoke out about her sexuality, in her remix of Macklemore&rsquo;s &lsquo;Same Love&rsquo;.</span></p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">\"...she sat me on the couch looked me straight in my face/ and said you&rsquo;ll burn in hell or probably die of AIDS&rdquo;</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lines include &ldquo;At age 13 my mother knew I wasn&rsquo;t straight/she didn&rsquo;t understand but she had so much to say/she sat me on the couch looked me straight in my face/ and said you&rsquo;ll burn in hell or probably die of AIDS&rdquo;.</p>\n<b></b><b>\u00a0</b>\n<h1 dir=\"ltr\">Zebra Katz</h1>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/katz.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-22248\" alt=\"katz\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/katz-e1385376039913.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></a></p>\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/zebrakatz/ima-read-clean-edit\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ojay Morgan, another New York native who describes himself as &lsquo;black, queer and other&rsquo; came to mainstream attention when his track &lsquo;Ima Read&rsquo; was used by designer Rick Owens at Paris Fashion Week in his show, on a continuous loop.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">describes himself as &lsquo;black, queer and other&rsquo;</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The track is dark, eerie and addictive. The &lsquo;read&rsquo; reference is what makes it interesting. While obviously being a reference to literacy (&ldquo;ima take that bitch to college&rdquo;), the track actually pays homage to the ballroom scene New York was famous for, where vogueing and drag culture were intrinsic. &lsquo;Zebra Katz is influenced by the likes of Grace Jones, Missy Elliot and Andre 3000.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">Frightening, disconcerting, and fabulous</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">He dilutes the darkness and aggression with high drama. Frightening, disconcerting, and fabulous.
