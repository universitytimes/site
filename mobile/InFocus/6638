The Society has been registered as the owner of \"Local Celebrity\", pictured above after his workout this morning.</div>\nHe\u00a0is the first addition to the Society's stable and runs at Cork Racecourse tomorrow in the I.N.H. Stallion Owners European Breeders Fund Maiden Hurdle at 12.50pm. This is not his first appearance on the race track, having had five previous runs. He has never been outside the first four, winning\u00a0last time out\u00a0and second on three previous\u00a0occasions.\n\nThis purchase marks another achievement for the Horse Racing Society, which has made a notable impression in its first year. With two successful racing days behind it and over 1,000 members, the Horse Racing Soc has gone from a concept to one of the largest societies in Trinity in a couple of months.\n<div>Horse Racing Society Auditor, Jack Cantillon\u00a0commented \"We are incredibly excited about tomorrow's race. We have a great chance and are lucky to have such a great team training the horse.\u00a0 We are very grateful to Willie Mullins and his team for giving us this opportunity.\u00a0 He should go close tomorrow and we will have a crowd there to cheer him on.\"</div>\n<div>\"Local Celebrity\" is trained by champion trainer Willie Mullins, who is in the middle of a hot streak at the minute having saddled 19 winners in the past 14 days. The jockey on board will be champion amateur jockey\u00a0Patrick Mullins, who despite his amateur status is one of the top jockeys in the country.</div>", "Imageurl": "6657", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6638", "Heading": "Horse Racing Soc becomes owner of its own horse"}
