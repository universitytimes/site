Barbarian on the Department of English&rsquo;s website which garnered national press attention, this morning students who logged on to the website for Trinity FM were greeted by a page proclaiming that the site had been hacked by a Bangladeshi hacker by the name of TIGER-M@TE.\n\nThe hack saw the homepage replaced by the words &ldquo;Server HackeD by TIGER-M@TE&rdquo; alongside the hash tag &ldquo;#Bangladeshi HackeR&rdquo; and the text &ldquo;Greetz: aBu.HaLiL501; w7sh.Syria; Sy-Hacker; NmR.Hacker; Wa7sh Hacker; h311 c0d3&rdquo;. \u00a0This was accompanied by an email address along with a banner reading &ldquo;Underground Hackers 2007-2011&rdquo;.\n\nThe pseudonym TIGER-M@TE has been responsible for several recent hackings including the pages for Bing, Nokia, Yahoo and Google in Bangladesh as well as being responsible for taking down the web page of a local paper in Bangladesh.\u00a0 The hacker, who has been working alone since 2007, targets servers hosting web pages as opposed to web applications themselves.\n\nTIGER-M@TE has traditionally targeted pages in Bangladesh and has merely replaced the homepages with a message proclaiming that they&rsquo;ve been hacked by him. None of the sites targeted have reported any damage being done to the servers which were hacked.\u00a0 This appears to be one of the first pages hacked by TIGER-M@TE outside of Bangladesh.\n\nUnlike the previous breaches of the Trinity Cat email and the Conan T. Barbarian profile, the Trinity FM website is run by a college society rather than the college itself.\u00a0 However the breach will once again raise questions about digital security in the college.\n\nTrinity FM could not be contacted for comment at the time of printing.", "Imageurl": "4728", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4727", "Heading": "Trinity FM website hacked"}
