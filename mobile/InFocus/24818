Our entire attitude to food can dictate our body&rsquo;s response to eating. \u00a0Society is constantly bombarding us with hyperbolised promises to good health and saturating our consciousness with skewed notions of what to eat. Unrealistic &lsquo;healthy&rsquo; expectations are glorified, various food types damned and buzz words such as &lsquo;detox&rsquo; and &lsquo;eat clean&rsquo; are misconstrued for deprivation and malnutrition. &ldquo;You are what you eat&rdquo; has been a hackneyed phrase for generations and is actually a thought that requires much amending. It&rsquo;s not only what we eat that impacts on our life but also in fact, how we eat.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The development of a positive mental association with eating is integral for good nutrition. The act of deprivation is an extremely negative one as it has been shown in countless dietary studies that restricting food types ends in long-term dissatisfaction and unsustainability as it causes us to crave the unattainable even more. The idea of chocolate cessation for the duration of Lent is a dangerous one. In all honestly, The Church has a lot to answer for with this rash period of inaccessibility. Watch how mood swings initially prevail and then, a new-found interest in other non-banned treats escalates. Forty days of punitive food abandonment is not only unpleasant but also unrealistic and damaging to our emotional interpretation of eating. Instead, a reduction in chocolate consumption and an increase in exercise would be much more beneficial.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eating with family and friends has untold social and emotional benefits, improves our attitude to food and decreases the likelihood of overeating. When we share meals, we also talk and slow down the eating process. \u00a0On the contrary, think of the rushed dinners you have wolfed down in front of a TV. You probably didn&rsquo;t reflect very much on what you were eating, you probably ate rhythmically in tune to the background music of the show and it&rsquo;s doubtful you enjoyed that meal very much.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the longest-living people on Earth hail from Okinawa, Japan and one of their secrets to good diet is eating until they are only 80% full. The brain takes about 20 minutes to register that the stomach is full so regulated eating can help us to regulate our food consumption, preventing overeating and protecting us from a myriad of health complications. When stress levels are high, increased levels of a hormone called cortisol can contribute to fat storage and fluctuating blood sugar levels (dramatic highs and lows experienced). Furthermore, eating small portions of healthy foods often can help to speed up the body&rsquo;s metabolism and enjoying food helps us to connect with our bodies and develop a pleasurable outlook on eating for health. Eating breakfast has been shown to quicken metabolic rates. Many cereals enriched with folic acid can help to reverse depressive symptoms, berries have been proven to delay the ageing process of the brain and eggs are a veritable super food with high levels of protein, zinc and omega 3. The choline present in the yolks is also involved in the signalling of memory supporting cells in the brain and an egg for breakfast can dramatically stave off hunger and cravings throughout the day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We have recently seen an upsurge in healthy eating establishments around Dublin. Is it all a fad or what do these over-priced caf\u00e9s offer that the local Spar doesn&rsquo;t? Taking five of the most popular, we looked at Blazing Salads, Chopped, Cornucopia, Staple Foods and Rustic Stone. Rustic Stone categorises each option on the menu according to its properties, be it low-fat, vegan, gluten free, high in protein etc. Some folk fool themselves that carbohydrates are to be avoided to their detriment. Whole grain carbohydrates are not only filling but also contain anti-oxidants that help to prevent the brain from premature ageing and damage and assist in serotonin production- a key chemical in mood stabilisation. Whole grains can play a role in the fight against cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Blazing Salads and Chopped are essentially founded on extensive salad production. Of course, it requires discernment to understand that a salad loaded with every ingredient in store loses its ridiculously low-calories benefit. Both venues can be bamboozling for the salad bar novice. Step in, Staple Foods. The charming den has four reasonable and delicious options, available in a roll or as a salad- wonderful simplicity. They also run a detox juice service for those tired of chewing solid foods and interested in a questionably cleansing baby-food regime of sipping pulpy liquids. Cornucopia has a fully vegan menu, replacing meat with energy-laden legumes such as lentils peas. Much of their menu contains nuts which are invaluably nourishing. Walnuts in particular are increasing mental alertness by improving neural connections. They are also rich sources of serotonin, helping to create a feeling of calm and happiness, as well as containing magnesium which has mood-boosting qualities and is involved in cell growth and strengthening of the body.</p>\r\nEating for happiness can be easily achieved with sufficient interest and moderate changes. Limiting unhealthy and processed foods, lowering sugar and salt intake, increasing fruit and vegetables, and decreasing alcohol intake. Usually, the cheaper the alcohol, the higher the level of impurities because of the shorter distillation time. Next time you eye up the bottle of Huzzar, think of the chronic headache awaiting you in the morning. Note, the quantity consumed may also impact on hangover severity. The jury is undecided on caffeine- one cup can prevent dementia, five can cause anxiety attacks. Healthy eating is all about moderation and regulation. Enjoying meals and filling yourself with a variety of satisfying and nourishing foods will enable you to enhance your mental and physical health, and invariably eat your way to happiness.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/shutterstock_112976938-1280x960.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24818", "Heading": "Eating for Happiness"}
