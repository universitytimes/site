{"Body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The results of the University Times survey on drug use by Trinity students will come as a surprise to some. To most it will not, nor should it. Drug use by students is not a phenomenon exclusive to Trinity and certainly not to Dublin, I would be surprised if the results of a poll conducted in UCD were significantly different. That over half of students have used cannabis within the last year is predictable. They know anecdotally, from the media, and from experience that the more hyperbolic claims about the effects of illegal drugs are nonsense, which only encourages experimentation. It is true that chemically, cannabis is no more addictive than chocolate, but chocolate is not banned outright by the state despite the links with gum disease and diabetes. Alcohol and tobacco are better analogues though, as they can be addictive and more obviously life threatening. While it is clich&eacute; to point out the comparatively benign health detriments of cannabis and mdma with alcohol and tobacco, it is far from the most compelling argument for drug policy reform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Nor is the economic argument which holds that simply by having a prohibition, we create a market that encourages crime and exploitation. As we inflate the price of drugs by limiting the supply to the black market, there is added incentive to engage in violent crime to make a profit in the drug trade, as Al Capone did in 1920&rsquo;s Chicago with alcohol. It too was banned for moral reasons, but it became clear that the cure was worse then the disease.

It was primarily this argument that drove California to Proposition 19, which will be voted on in November. Under this law, the sale of cannabis will remain illegal, but people may possess of up to 28 grams by people over 21. This would be to be taxed by the state at $50 which could generate $1.6 billion a year in new revenue, helping California&rsquo;s projected budget deficit of $40 billion, similar to Ireland&rsquo;s projected &euro;40 billion.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">No, the reason there must be drug policy reform in Ireland is because the University Times survey suggests that over half of Trinity students are supposedly engaging in criminal activity.
