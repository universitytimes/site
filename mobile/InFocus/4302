While no one expected much of a challenge from the Japanese, the routing witnessed today was almost dull to watch it became so predictable. And the Kiwis weren&rsquo;t even playing all that well by their standards.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA much altered side from their clash with Tonga, the All Blacks fielded a team with ten changes in total from their clash with Tonga. Key absentees included captain Richie McCaw and talsiman Dan Carter. Going by the scoreline alone, they were hardly missed.\n\nThat said, we cannot disregard the fact that the team fielded by Kiwi Legend and Japan coach John Kirwan was also heavily altered from their first choice 15.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStill, lacklustre defending from the Japanese from the moment the whistle blew showed no sign of the spark and intent witnessed against the French last week. The match was over before it even began.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith play getting off to an All Black dominated start, middle and end, it was almost like watching pre-match drills.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe opening try to Conrad Smith was a gift, with almost no challenge from the Japanese not two minutes in. The conversion was kicked over by Colin Slade, starting replacement for Carter, who is currently being watched for a back injury.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA second try by Richard Kahui pushed the lead to 0-12 by 15 minutes, and the Kiwi&rsquo;s looked to be chasing a scoreline last seen in their 1995 clash with the Japanese, a devastating\u00a0147-17 victory.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKaino scored a third try six minutes later, cutting through the absent Japanese defence with ease.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJapanese set piece too seemed non-existent with their first decent scrum effectively being coached by Nigel Owens. Ironically, from that first solid Japanese scrum came Mealamu&rsquo;s try, which secured NZ bonus point just after 30 min.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust a few moments later and Conrad Smith created an opportunity for Andy Elise, try number 5. The score? 0-31\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQue the restart and almost immediately Slade went over for his first ever try in a World Cup, pushing the lead to 0-38; almost a point a minute in the first half.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith so many choice players missing from the New Zealand side, the ruthlessness seen in the second half could only have come from those proving they&rsquo;d a right to be on the pitch next week.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKahui, whose selection was much discussed\u00a0before the tournament, went over for his fourth try in two games 46 minutes in. 0-45.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSonnie Bill Williams got his first try in All Black minutes after coming onto the pitch. 0-52.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nToeava&rsquo;s try then brought the score up to a staggering 0-59.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEach try was more or less unopposed, open holes in the opposition defence giving the Kiwi&rsquo;s opportunities on a silver platter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen, Japan finally, at long last, made it onto the board with a beautiful intercept try from Onozawa that was greeted with cheers from Japanese and All Black supporters alike.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe conversion was the kicked over by Murray Williams, no I didn&rsquo;t get the names mixed up, Murray Williams. Make of that what you will. The Japanese were up to 7-59\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTry number ten by Horne quickly put an end to the short moment of Japanese confidence. 7-64 at 61 minutes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA beautifully created run from Sonnie Bill Williams from deep within their own half had Manonu going over for his first, and the eleventh kiwi try in total, of the match, having created at least four of the previous scores.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAfter a period of play in which the Japanese actually engaged defensively, they were once again ripped apart through the center by the Thompson for try number 12 at 77 minutes. A minute and a kick and chase later, Williams (Sonnie Bill, not Japans Murray) went over for his second try of the match just before full time.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe final score of 83-7 says all there is to say about that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe Kiwi&rsquo;s have proven they&rsquo;re forced to be reckoned with in their first two tests. But against sides that are not really that much of a challenge. One worry that came to the forefront which Levermont will have no doubt taken note of, the lack of a to standard replacement for Carter. Slade, while a good player, had an iffy match at best, missing some average kicks and making simple handling errors. One of which led to the Japan try.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see what happens once the Kiwi&rsquo;s are faced with real competition in Marc Lievremont's France.", "Imageurl": "4303", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4302", "Heading": "Hosts turn it on to batter Japan"}
