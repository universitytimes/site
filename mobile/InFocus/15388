From his stables in Kildare he has produced some of the top National Hunt horses in Ireland. Perhaps most famously, Dessie&rsquo;s handling of the wonderful Hardy Eustace saw him collect back to back Champion Hurdles at Cheltenham in 2004 and 2005. Dessie himself found Cheltenham success as a jockey when he rode the 1977 Gold Cup winner Davy Lad to success. This year he takes a string of eight (at time of print) to the 2013 Cheltenham Festival. With this year&rsquo;s bunch he has none other than Triumph Hurdle favourite OUR CONOR:\nQ: OUR CONOR was mightily impressive last time out at Leopardstown and he&rsquo;s now as short as 4/1 for the Triumph Hurdle (Tuesday 12th March). How do you rate his chances?\n\nA: He&rsquo;s in good form and would definitely be my best chance of the meeting. He has come on a lot for that win last time and will enjoy the better ground at Cheltenham next week. The going was very testing at Leopardstown last time and I think we&rsquo;ll see an even better horse with good ground. He jumps very well and looks to be the one to beat. I&rsquo;ve had him since he was a two-year-old and so I know the horse very well indeed. He&rsquo;s a lovely, easy horse to train and his very enthusiastic owners have turned down many an offer for him! I hope that he can improve again at Cheltenham.\n\nQ: MINSK was very impressive back in November at Punchestown. Is he another horse that will prefer the better ground at Cheltenham next week?\n\nA: Yes, Minsk will go to the 2mile 5furlong race (The Neptune Investment Management Novice Hurdle &ndash; Wednesday 13th March) where he&rsquo;ll need to improve on his last couple of runs to be in with a good chance. The extra couple of furlongs should be what he needs.\n\nQ: You have a good group of horses entered in the Handicaps next week. Who should we keep our eye out for?\n\nA: Si C&rsquo;Etait Vrai goes to the Pertemps Final (Thursday 13th March) on a mark of 145 after his second at Navan last time. He should give a good account of himself. Action Master goes to the same race and shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored. White Star Line is another that will benefit from the good ground. He&rsquo;ll have a good chance in the Novice Handicap Chase (Tuesday 12th March) over 2mile 5furlongs. Those three will have decent each way chances.\n\nQ: Finally, Ireland hasn&rsquo;t come home with the Cheltenham Gold Cup since War of Attrition in 2006. What do you make of the Irish chances this year?\n\nA: Obviously Sir Des Champs should have an excellent chance. He&rsquo;s a class horse and obviously loves Cheltenham and the Festival (he won the Martin Pipe Handicap in 2011 and the Jewson Novices&rsquo; Chase last year). The extra few furlongs should be ideal for him. First Leuitenant shouldn&rsquo;t be forgotten and he ran a great race last time to be beaten a head by Tidal Bay. I&rsquo;d say with Sir Des Champs in the form he has been in this year he should be right up there.\n\nDESSIE&rsquo;S TIP FOR THE WEEK: OUR CONOR &ndash; Triumph Hurdle (Currently 4/1 with Boylesports)\n\n\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Philip Hobbs</strong> is one of England&rsquo;s premier National Hunt Trainers. He has trained an array of Cheltenham Festival winners including the much treasured Rooster Booster who won the Champion Hurdle in 2003 and Flagship Uberalles who claimed the Queen Mother Champion Chase in 2001. Since then he has had successes in the Triumph Hurdle with Made in Japan and Detroit City. This year he goes to Cheltenham with a large team. Most notably he holds a cracking chance in the Gold Cup with CAPTAIN CHRIS.\u00a0</span>\n\nQ: CAPTAIN CHRIS ran an absolute blinder when only just beaten by Long Run in the final strides of the King George. Can he reverse those Kempton placing&rsquo;s to win the Gold Cup?\n\nA: I really do think he has a big, big chance and is most certainly overpriced (currently 16/1). The good ground will be ideal and he has showed all the right signs that he will stay the three and a quarter miles. He really has come of age this year and considering he never reached the racecourse until he was a six year old he still has improvement in him. His jumping was perfect until he fluffed the last at Ascot last time. The biggest danger for me is Bobs Worth. With all due respect to the Irish I do not think they&rsquo;ll be winning the race. Through the Tidal Bay form (Tidal Bay beat First Lieutenant and Sir Des Champs at the end of December and he himself was beaten by Bobs Worth) all signs show Bobs Worth is a worthy favourite. I think our fella should have a good chance to challenge him.\n\nQ: With WISHFULL THINKING you&rsquo;re taking on Sprinter Sacre in the Champion Chase. Are you going for the place money!?\n\nA: I think we will be! There is very decent place prize money to be picked up in defeat to Sprinter Sacre as he won&rsquo;t be good enough to be winning. Regardless of Sprinter Sacre there are some very good horses. Sizing Europe is one of them. It won&rsquo;t be an easy fight for second!\n\nQ: MENORAH has done you so proud in the past. What do you make of his chances in the Ryanair Chase?\n\nA: He is in very good form and this better ground he will suit. Similar to him, Balthazaar King will be a different horse on good ground. He&rsquo;ll be running off a mark of 146 but he needs this ground so should have a very good chance.\n\nQ: Finally, what horses of yours would be worth backing at a bigger price?\n\nA: Pistol runs in the Fred Winter Handicap Hurdle (Wednesday 13th March) off a mark of 135 and would be a good one at an each-way price (currently 20/1 with Boylesports). He should run well in a larger field. Similarly, Saddler&rsquo;s Risk is a good each-way option in the Coral Cup (Wednesday 13t March). Village Vic is another one with a good each-way chance and he will also either go to the Coral Cup or the Martin Pipe Handicap.\n\nPHILIP&rsquo;S TIP FOR THE WEEK: CAPTAIN CHRIS &ndash; Cheltenham Gold Cup (16/1 with Boylesports\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Richard Hobson</strong> is a very successful bloodstock agent, purchasing top class horses for big industry names such as Michael O&rsquo;Leary (Ryanair) and Willie Mullins. He is prolific for his purchase of the Champion hurdler, Hurricane Fly. This year among his purchases is the Gold Cup fancy Sir Des Champs, Saint Are and of course Hurricane Fly who stakes to reclaim the Champion Hurdle after his defeat last year.\n\nQ: HURRICANE FLY has been installed as the 2/1 favourite for this year&rsquo;s Champion Hurdle. Do you think he&rsquo;ll be able to justify favouritism?\n\nA: Following his third in last year&rsquo;s race, Willie (Mullins) came out to confirm that he had been poorly in that race. Tests confirmed that his blood was not right so that run can be forgotten. He&rsquo;s had a troubled free run of things this year and has shown what a class animal he is. I don&rsquo;t think the race is as competitive as it has been in recent years especially after the loss of Darlan. Although it was bottomless when he won at Leopardstown last time, Hurricane Fly is versatile on all ground so the better going that we are expecting won&rsquo;t be an issue. I think if any horse was to beat him it would be an outsider as I don&rsquo;t believe Rock on Ruby is good enough to come back and win it again this year.\n\nQ: SIR DES CHAMPS must have a fantastic chance?\n\nA: I think what is essential for Sir Des Champs is the better ground. He will be a much better horse on good ground and his jumping will be more fluent. He&rsquo;s already won twice at the Festival and Willie Mullins has openly said what great form he&rsquo;s in and he stays so the three and a quarter miles should be just what he wants. Obviously Bobs Worth will be the main danger but I have a lot of confidence in Sir Des Champs.\n\nQ: SAINT ARE is another horse you bought that runs at Cheltenham. Which race will he go for?\n\nA: He will either go to the JLT on the Tuesday or the Kim Muir on the Thursday. The Kim Muir is an Amateur Riders race which is the one I would prefer. \u00a0His long term plan is the Scottish Grand National so he is essentially being geared up for that.\nRICHARD&rsquo;S TIP FOR THE WEEK: Un Atout &ndash; Supreme Novice Hurdle (currently 8/1)\n\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Alan King</strong> is one of the most successful trainers in Britain. He has had tremendous success over the jumps since taking out a license in 1999 and has a fine record at the Cheltenham Festival. My Way De Solzen was his first Festival winner in 2006 taking the World Hurdle followed by the Arkle Challenge Trophy the next year. Since then he has had a multitude of success including Triumph (2007) and Champion Hurdle (2008) winner, Katchit. Another famous win came when Voy Por Ustedes took the Champion Chase in 2007. This year he takes a select team of eleven to Prestbury Park.\u00a0</span>\n\nQ: Smad Place goes for the World Hurdle (Thursday 14th March). What do you make of his chances?\n\nA: He was third in this race last year and he&rsquo;ll appreciate the better ground that they&rsquo;ll probably have on the day. He&rsquo;s only had two runs this season, both over three miles and a furlong. Although he ran well in both races the heavy ground just caught him out. If he runs as well as he did last year I&rsquo;ll be thrilled.\n\nQ: GODSMEJUDGE is an interesting horse. He goes to the four mile Amateur Riders race (Wednesday 13th March) and is currently a decent price of 10/1. Surely he should be up there with the best of them?\n\nA: He&rsquo;s done everything that has been asked of him this season. He stays and jumps all day and ran well at Warwick where he won the Novice Chase. He should be my best chance of a winner although it is a very competitive and open race.\n\nQ: In the Fred Winter Handicap on Wednesday you have both McVICAR and KING OF DUDES running. You&rsquo;ve always done so well with your juvenilles, what do you make of these two?\n\nA: McVicar is rated 129 and King of Dudes is 124 so they are both relatively well handicapped. They&rsquo;re not good enough to go for the Triumph Hurdle but they&rsquo;re decent juvenilles so we thought we&rsquo;d take a crack at this race. Its always a very tough race and you need to have a horse who can cope with the big field. I&rsquo;d like to hope they both will give a good account of themselves.\n\nQ: Finally, Bakbenscher has had a great season. Where does he run?\n\nA: Bakbenscher has had a good run of things this season but he isn&rsquo;t the easiest horse to train! He&rsquo;s entered up in both the Coral Cup (Wednesday 13th March) and the Pertemps Final (Thursday 14th March). I think three miles may be pushing it for him so I am leaning towards him running in the Coral Cup which is over two miles five furlongs.\n\nALAN&rsquo;S TIP OF THE WEEK &ndash; GODSMEJUDGE, John Oaksey National Hunt Chase (currently 10/1 with Boylesports)", "Imageurl": "15390", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15388", "Heading": "Cheltenham '13: The Interviews"}
