While the quantity of the works on display has been restricted, the quality definitely hasn&rsquo;t. The smaller exhibition space has lent itself to a great variety of works. Rather than a room of landscape works, rooms feature a mixture of \u00a0types of paintings -landscapes, portraits, historical, religious, imaginative or genre paintings- making for very interesting viewing.\n\nThe Masterpieces of the Collection exhibition showcases some of the highlights of the works at the Gallery. Divided into two sections, Irish and European, it features a variety of paintings, drawings and sculptures. The Irish collection contains works by artists such as W.B. Yeats, William John Leech, John Lavery and Roderic O&rsquo;Conor. A highlight of the Irish display is definitely <em>The Meeting on the Turret Stairs</em>. Rarely on display due to its delicate nature this is a beautiful painting of the last meeting of two star crossed lovers, a knight and a princess. It has been installed in a special cabinet, and is open for viewing on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11 to 12, and on Saturdays from 2 to 3. The richness of the colours makes it hard to believe this is a watercolour. With a tragic story of doomed love, this is a fascinating work-not just in terms of the artist&rsquo;s skill, but also the tale behind it.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8765\" title=\"\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/painting-113-193x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"193\" height=\"300\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNGI 2358\n\n<strong><em>Hellelil and Hildebrand, the Meeting on the Turret Stairs</em></strong>\n\nArtist: Frederic William Burton\n\nDanish,19th century, 1864\n\nWatercolour and gouache on paper\n\nUnframed: 95.5 x 60.8 cm\n\nPhoto \u0160 National Gallery of Ireland\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn contrast to the brightness of the Irish section, the European section is dramatic with rich red walls. It features a broad range of works, from Byzantine right up to Cubists. With paintings by Monet, Rembrandt, Caravaggio and Picasso it is an impressive and interesting display. Metsu&rsquo;s pair of paintings (or pendants) <em>Man Writing a Letter</em> and <em>Woman Reading a Letter</em> are charming, and again have a story to tell. The man is a wealthy merchant-he is richly dressed, has an oriental rug on his table and a globe by the window. He is writing a love letter. In this painting&rsquo;s pair we see his lover reading the letter. Her hair, plucked except for a curl left on her forehead tells us she is engaged. She is not as wealthy as her lover, and her room is more homely. The painting within a painting shows stormy seas indicating there may be trouble in their relationship.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8766\" title=\"\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/painting-23-233x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"233\" height=\"300\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNGI 4536\n\n<strong><em>Man Writing a Letter</em></strong>\n\nArtist: Gabriel Metsu\n\nDutch,17th century, c.1664-c.1666\n\nOil on wood panel\n\nUnframed: 52.5 x 40.2 cm\n\nPhoto \u0160 National Gallery of Ireland\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/painting-33-230x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"230\" height=\"300\" />\n\nNGI 4537\n\n<strong><em>Woman Reading a Letter</em></strong>\n\nArtist: Gabriel Metsu\n\nDutch,17th century, c.1664-1666\n\nOil on wood panel\n\nUnframed: 52.5 x 40.2 cm\n\nPhoto \u0160 National Gallery of Ireland\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs well as the Masterpieces of the Collection the Gallery have some special exhibitions on at the moment. One such exhibition is the enchanting display of illustrations Fables and Fairytales. Featuring works by John Butler Yeats, Richard and Charles Doyle, Paul Henry and Harry Clarke this small exhibition shows a fascinating selection of illustrations, inspired by fairytales, stories and poetry. \u00a0With humorous sketches like <em>Tommy Being Eaten by a Lion</em> or marvellous fairytale scenes such as <em>The Triumphal Pageant: A Fairy Tale</em> this is definitely an exhibition worth seeing. Harry Clarke&rsquo;s illustrations are superb, for example <em>The Little Sea Maid</em>, an illustration from Hans Christian Anderson&rsquo;s tale is beautiful, the jewel like colours reminiscent of Clarke&rsquo;s stained glass windows. Her dress is shaped like a shell, showing her watery origins, as does the wavy blue background.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8768\" title=\"\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/painting-43-221x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"221\" height=\"300\" />\n\nNGI 2010.3\n<strong>The Little Sea Maid</strong>\nArtist: Harry Clarke\nIrish,20th century, 1915\nGraphite, ink, gouache and watercolour on paper\nUnframed: 46 x 33 cm (oval)\nPhoto \u0160 National Gallery of Ireland\n\n<em>The Fables and Fairytales exhibition continues until the 25<sup>th</sup> of March.</em>\n<strong>Jenny Duffy</strong>\n\nStaff writer\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "8769", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Exterior-MWing3", "ID": "8763", "Heading": "Miniatures, Magic and Masterpieces: Exhibitions at the National Gallery"}
