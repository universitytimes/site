Then, due to Andrew having to be in work in Monkstown at 11am Sun, our effective travelling time was reduced to an 18hr round trip.\n\nWe were pleased enough with our voyage, however, first setting loose about the Dublin City hinterlands begging coins and chicken fillys from the city's fine folk and well meaning establishments (Gwan Maguires), lapping Trinity at least\u00a0five times in the mean time. Finally, after much indecision and an entirely pointless pedalo journey, we talked our way out to the airport via airport bus circa 4pm where our high hopes of hasty return flights to Paris were dashed for taking part in illegal (and not frowned upon) airport begging..\n\nOur hopes diminished but not destroyed, we stole ourselves to make for the border and reach the Belfast citadel. Thankfully, we wormed our way onto a Belfast bound Aircoach, gratefully into a free Hoilday Inn room and then a delicious complimentary combination meal from the lovely girls at Nandos, of which the photos exclaim our sheer delight. We then got quite drunk, searched the streets of Belfast in early morn for some green beacon, which we unfortunately could not find, became distinctly aware of our southern origins, and returned to our hotel room defeated..\n\nThe next morn we awoke late, rushing out with cheers of thanks to our Holiday Inn hosts, and luckily catching the good moustache'd Stuart, esquire of the Belfast morning aircoach, who kindly offered us free lifts back to Dublin early in the morning, Andrew making it into work at 11am where he no doubtedly attracted the annoyance of his supervisors for his lack of sleep induced vacant stare..\n\nAll in all it was good craic and we would do it again,\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\nTEAM 23: James Morris &amp; Andrew Cox\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>", "Imageurl": "15629", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15622", "Heading": "The Jailbreak Diaries - A Night in Belfast"}
