Christmas is coming. And if you haven&rsquo;t yet been swept in by twinkling lights and Facebook telling you people have posted about it, not to worry; in six weeks time you&rsquo;ll be so bored with it, Christmas will come and go and it&rsquo;ll just be plain old Tuesday 27<sup>th</sup> December.\n\nChristmas supposedly &lsquo;officially&rsquo; arrived in Dublin on Friday evening. The Brown Thomas Christmas windows were uncovered and the lights were turned on. Yes, I have to admit the ballet themed windows are very pretty but are hardly traditionally Christmassy and as for the lights being turned on, well that was just a shambles. For anyone that was out on Thursday night &ndash; the lights were already on. Arguably the more exciting part of the switch on was Michael Bubl\u00e9; he&rsquo;s Canadian, (exotic) he&rsquo;s good looking (not Irish) and he&rsquo;s famous (he&rsquo;s sold more albums than Jedward) &ndash; it was set to be good.\n\nHowever, the event was so hyped up that an hour before it was scheduled to begin men in high visibility jackets announced it was full and the road was now closed. That was the first disappointment as I strolled over to Grafton Street ready to feel that initial wave of festive cheer. A moment of genius struck and I went with my friends into M&amp;S through the Duke Street entrance, effectively into their own mini Christmas, and up to the rooftop caf\u00e9. That was closed. So down we went to the windows of the men&rsquo;s department and strained to see the Bubl\u00e9 himself from in between suit jackets, shirts and ties. It was only 5.10. We still have 50minutes to wait.\n\nIt seemed luck was finally on our side it was announced the event was going to be brought forward and the superstar would be appearing soon. So, patiently we waited. At 5.45 it finally began with Ballerinas dancing and a somewhat trim Santa appearing on stage. After some awkward exchanges with Santa and some impressive, but odd ballet, (the theme of the windows was still unknown) he finally emerged. Looking swarve in a dark navy coat Bubl\u00e9 appeared and made his way to the stage signing autographs as he went. All very touching &ndash; had I been on the front row. After a short countdown he &lsquo;turned on&rsquo; the lights (there was a short delay as the lights were actually turned on by someone offstage) and off he went. Mr International Superstar. No performance, no interview, no nothing. That was actually it. It was 6.01. With my festive enthusiasm sapped I ventured on to Grafton Street to marvel at the lights &ndash; which I&rsquo;d seen the previous night - before an excellent decision was taken and we went to the Pav. So much for the beginning of Christmas.\n\nAlthough Friday was the official arrival Christmas &lsquo;unofficially&rsquo; arrived on Grafton Street the week after Halloween as tinsel reindeers appeared in the BT2 window. Since then the number of gaudy decorations and glitzy, sorry, I mean, tacky &lsquo;things&rsquo; has slowly been increasing in every shop, caf\u00e9 and restaurant around. I can only describe them as &lsquo;things&rsquo; because there&rsquo;s really nothing of worth in the majority of Christmas tack in shops. What will you really use that glass robin ornament for that you bought at a marked up price simply because it had a bit of glitter sprinkled over it? The same can be asked of almost every Santa related item. They come in every shape and size and always in the trade mark red suit, ranging from the ornate to the ridiculous, and sometime even creepy, Santas are simply a waste of money. They&rsquo;ll sit in your attic for 11 \u02dd months of the year collecting dust only to be uncovered in December as you question, why did I buy this again?\n\nThe commercialisation of Christmas has been criticised for years, the religious aspect a hindrance to many these days as they are made to wait until after Church before present opening can begin, but yet it continues. The build up getting bigger than the actual day itself. Now it could just be because I&rsquo;m getting old, final year of college and all that, but Christmas has long since lost its childish appeal and now is a chore of present buying, cooking and an inevitable fight with wrapping paper and cellotape on Christmas Eve. But after the big day, and the recovery process of the 26<sup>th</sup> December, we find ourselves most likely disappointed in some way, if not just because the excuse to not study and &lsquo;be merry&rsquo; has gone, and it really is just a Tuesday.\n\nBut you know that in 11 \u02dd months you&rsquo;ll be swept in again by the &lsquo;run up to Christmas.&rsquo; Jeez &ndash; I&rsquo;ll probably be camped in front of Brown Thomas from midday, and all for what? A few days of overindulgence that are excused. And why do we do it? Well, you know, because it&rsquo;s Christmas.", "Imageurl": "6584", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6582", "Heading": "Countdown to Christmas"}
