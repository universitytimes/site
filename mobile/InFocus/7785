When asked for a word to describe this year&rsquo;s DU Snow Sports trip to Les Arcs 1800, this was the response I got. After last year&rsquo;s debauchery of people &ldquo;wreaking havoc in an exclusive Alpine resort&rdquo;, it was hard not to have that apocalyptic (excuse the pun, credit to William Quirk) feeling as we boarded the buses at 6am, en route to The Alps. Things seemed to be running smoothly though, Captain Cara was beginning to relax, people were sneakily scoping out the talent in the rows around them and as we pulled out of Nassau Street everyone had that feeling akin to that one The Black Eyed Peas have that annoying song about.\n\nThe journey as far as Dover was rather uneventful; nervous introductions, cups of coffee, naps, that kind of thing. It wasn&rsquo;t until we were on French soil that things really kicked off. The details are hazy, so bear with me here. There was definitely drink involved, that much I know, and things escalated pretty quickly, jumped up a notch then with a few dubious games of &ldquo;Never Have I Ever&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m pretty sure I punched a guy in the face. Next thing anyone remembers was waking up with the mother of all hangovers, each claiming theirs was worse than anyone else&rsquo;s.\n\nA cure for this? Why stopping in a French supermarket and stocking up on 1L bottles of own brand vodka for &euro;13 of course! Looking back, this may have been the downfall of many a tripper.\n\nOn arrival in resort, we were all herded to our rooms and met with our reps who informed us that the first night was &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Wally&rdquo; themed. Good call for a first night I thought, gives optimum excuse to go up to members of the opposite sex, grope them inappropriately and pull the old &ldquo;oh sorry, I thought you were my friend, she&rsquo;s wearing the same top as you.&rdquo; You&rsquo;d know Will Courtney was picking the themes. Other nights included &ldquo;What I want to be when I grow up&rdquo;, &ldquo;Blast from the Past&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rave&rdquo; (with special guest Krafty Kutz) and Rubix Cube.\n\nI suppose I should talk a bit about the actual ski part of the ski trip, considering that is why we were all there, so here goes; we skied some. Okay, now back to the drinking. I jest, the skiing was top notch. Aside from the fact it was difficult for beginners to get to Apr\u00e9s Ski up the mountain, which was later resolved for the mountain meal by the innovative &ldquo;Party Bus&rdquo;, the set up was perfect. The snow was fresh, the slopes were fast and the go-pros were being flashed left right and centre (clearly the &ldquo;furby&rdquo; present of Christmas 2k11).\n\nSo what about the debauchery you may ask? Where are the tales of swastikas and spend-offs? Of police arrests and ferry cells? Of trolley races and people hitting each other over the head with crates? Well, to be honest with you, we were rather well behaved this year... but then again, what happens on ski-trip stays on ski-trip.</div>", "Imageurl": "7786", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "7785", "Heading": "Ski trip review: Relentless fun without all the illegal stuff"}
