{"Body": "Rachel Lavin, Mary-Ellen Cullinan and Joseph Noonan (photographer)-\n\nOh the JCR, as much as I like to poke fun/slag/slander and defame them for taking sexual advantage of freshers to being riddled with STI&rsquo;s , we have to hand it to them, they have done good this year. From a jam-packed fresher week to Assasinations, Halls-oween to Halls got talent, Christmas nights in Reynards to movie nights in, Take me out to Mystery Tours. (although I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever get over the cancellation of the Naked Mile Run) their performance on the JCR was truly unprecedented. Yes, My JCR really does love me! However, now it is time to pass the torch to the next round of freshers and the election race is heating up in Halls. So, without further a due, six of the candidates in the leading races of Presidency, Ents officer and treasurer took the time out form harassing residents to vote for them to explain in detail their plans for next year.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>PRESIDENT:</strong>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>\nRachel Moore<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Rachael-Moore.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2684\" style=\"border: 3px solid blue;\" title=\"Rachael Moore\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Rachael-Moore-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>\n</strong><em>Course: Drama &amp; French\nFrom: Limerick\nHouse: 91</em>\n<em>Experience:</em>\nI have worked as this years JCR secretary and gained great experience, learned so many new skills and made amazing contacts, so I know exactly what the JCR needs to do.\n\n<em>Manifesto:</em>\nI want to save the 128 and get a Dublin Bikes dock near Halls. I&rsquo;ve set up a petition and canvassed to Dublin City Council for both. I want to expand the deal-of-the week to restaurants, businesses and take-aways and have &lsquo;Basket-of-the week&rsquo;s in Smiles so you can pick up your whole meal together. I also want to\nget everything working, so much equipment isn&rsquo;t working and it&rsquo;s a waste o resources. I want the canteen to be open to students 23 hours a day and I want o warrant the all-weather pitch which is established lately as funded so why not go ahead? It would be such an amazing resource for students.\n\n<em>How do you feel about the possibility of Schols being in Halls next year?</em>\nI don&rsquo;t feel it is a concern to first years but I think it is detrimental to the ethos of the scholarly society. I certainly don&rsquo;t feel it is &lsquo;like sending them back to Siberia&rsquo; (as reported in Trinity News by head of Scholls) though.\n\n<em>More importantly, How do you feel about taking sexual advantage of innocent first years?</em>\nWell, &hellip;I feel the JCR is well equipped, experienced and competent to deal with this &hellip;not me though, I&rsquo;ll be a third year!\n\n<strong>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/David-Egan.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2686\" style=\"border: 3px solid blue;\" title=\"David Egan\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/David-Egan-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>David Egan</strong>\n<em>Course: S.F.

I&rsquo;m also second year class rep and even as a teenager set up a business for teenage discos locally.\n\n<em>Manifesto:</em>\nI want to completely transform the JCR. I want to commercialise it by getting them more value for money, for example by getting sponsors and packages. It&rsquo;s something that would create revenue for the JCR. I also am interested in the Dublin Bus docks and lobbying the 128 route. I also really want to push through the all-weather pitch for April, it&rsquo;s a fantastic opportunity for Halls.\n\n<em>Do you think we need to incorporate societies from college to Halls?</em>\nI think we need more societies within Halls. I like the idea of Halls being separate, our own independent little community.\n\n<em>How do you plan to deal with noise levels?</em>\nWe&rsquo;ve been trying for months but nothing can be done. The accommodations even tried handing out lollipops after the Mystery Tour to keep noise down. I think the most effective thing to be done is just constant monitoring by security at night.\n\n<em>Which modern day politician would you shift and why?</em>\nJoanne Burton, she&rsquo;s just&hellip;lovely.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>ENTS OFFICER:</strong>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/brianna.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2704\" style=\"border: red 3px solid;\" title=\"brianna\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/brianna-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a>Brianna Turner\n</strong><em>Course: Politics &amp; Geography\n</em><em>From: Dublin\n</em><em>House: 85</em>\n<em>Experience:</em>\nI worked with DCG (Dublin Clubs and Guide) during sixth year. I went on to work with Trinity Ents and then Late nights Events which is Alchemy on Mondays, Purty Kitchen Tuesdays, etc. In first year I&rsquo;ve ran two Halls go To Wrights nights and organized last Mondays Pre-party in Alchemy with Rosa. I was also my class rep this year and work as staff in a night club so I know lots of DJs, bouncers and helpful contacts.\n\n<em>Manifesto:</em>\nI don&rsquo;t think I would improve anything, just do more. I wasn&rsquo;t to get better concessions for students and have more themed nights with a facebook page so people know exactly what&rsquo;s going on and whose going where and they can decide.\n\n<em>What about students who aren&rsquo;t interested in night clubs?\n</em>Well I want to get a few things going especially during the daytime during freshers week like barbeques and just getting people outside for chatting and bonding basically.\n\n<em>More importantly, How do you plan to seduce next years freshers?\n</em>Well I have a few outfits&hellip;and I might walk around with handcuffs just so they can&rsquo;t get away.\n\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>Ellen Hanley<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Ellen-Hanley.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2687\" style=\"border: 3px solid red;\" title=\"Ellen Hanley\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Ellen-Hanley-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" /></a>\n</strong><em>From: Thomastown, Kilkenny\n</em><em>Course: Science\n</em><em>House: Cunningham, 79</em>\n<em>Manifesto:</em>\nI was on ENTS all of this year and I'm really involved in Genockey's team. Next year I'll be involved with Chris O'Connor. I think in Halls the nights out sometimes develop into a pattern where you always end up socialising with the same group. Next year, if elected, I&rsquo;d like to bring ENTs on campus to the JCR. Get 4th year girls to put manners on 1st year boys! Also I think that a lot of students are very aimless during Freshers Week. I'd like to have more events on, such as a welcome barbecue where people could just relax and chat. Speed friending could work really well, especially if it was specified to courses, that way before you even start college you have friends in your course. I'd like to start up an online forum, to have an ENTs page so that residents can have a say in what events take place. I know that some students have a lot of hours, lots of Health care students have 12 hour days so I'd like to put on events that they could take part in. I think a shuttle bus to the cinema or bowling would be a good alternative to a night out.\n\n<em>Experience:</em>\nI was on ENTS all of this year and I'm really involved in Genockey's team. Next year I'll be involved with Chris O'Connor. I'm also class rep for Science, the second biggest course! On Tuesday I won Conveyor for the School of Science. I have strong ties with the SU and links with ENTs, so I'd like to get more welfare events to Halls.\n\n<em>More importantly, if you could be any animal in Halls, which would you be?</em>\nI don&rsquo;t know about an animal but I'd be Sally the Ghost from Cunningham.

But I need something to keep me going and I know the JCR will suit me perfectly. I&rsquo;ve also organized events, like to Belfast for my birthday, Halls to Wrights, Alchemy nights and things like that. It&rsquo;s the backstage stuff that is actually the hardest but I&rsquo;m most experienced in that.\n\n<em>Manifesto:\n</em>I want to improve the discount card and already have gotten in contact with some very willing local businesses in Rathmines. I also would like to organize a visit to the Dail with an MP form county Louth (not the one you&rsquo;re thinking of!) and obviously the big thing is the 128 bus\n<em>\nDo you think Halls needs the 128 route more than Clongriffin?\n</em>I think we definetly need it. The Luas is already at full capacity. Part of the reason is noise and disruption at night time so I think of we propose the suspend it at ten o&rsquo;clock before the mad rush or clubs they might compromise with us.\n\n<em>More importantly; How do you propose to deal with the thin-wall/loud-sex problem?\n</em>Well my apartment have dealt with this extensively and I find banging on the wall right back and shouting &lsquo;SHuut UUup tends to help.\n\n<em>If you could compare yourself to one Halls pet which would you be?\n</em>I&rsquo;d definetly be the warden&rsquo;s cat, I mean how amazing would that be? Id get to live with the warden and have you seen he craic he has around here?

I&rsquo;ve got an abundance of ideas and great contacts, like Haribo, Coke and Kellogs, what more does a fresher need?\n\n<em>Manifesto:</em>\nI want to release a Freshers magazine like I saw with the Phil and the Hist. It would have all you need to know about the JCR and give you maps and places you need to know about in Rathmines, sort of a survival guide! I want to expand the discount card to include nights out. I want to run a big Christmas Day like UL and UCC.\n\n<em>Issues: How do you propose to deal with security in Halls given all the intruders this year?\n</em>We definetly need more awareness of the dangers to stop freshers leaving doors open and putting themselves in danger in other ways.\n\n<em>More importantly, How will you protect the new-born Ducklings form prey?\n</em>Em, I&rsquo;m willing to set up a 24 hour watch and I will personally, as your JCR vice president, sit in a canoe in the pond and ward away any predators, morning, noon and night", "Imageurl": "2696", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2683", "Heading": "A look at the leading JCR election candidates"}
