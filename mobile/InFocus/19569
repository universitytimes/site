{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">KC Peaches. Chicken Fillet Rolls. Lemon. Yum Thai. There are many food crazes that strike Trinity students, but none quite so gripping or as entertaining as the Burrito Wars. Those wraps full of vegetables, spices and suspicious-looking meat have hooked starving undergrads in like no other foodstuff. Several fine establishments popped up to fill the need of the masses, resulting in a filthy underhanded competition of who could offer the most bang for that 6.50 price students are willing to fork over. As the dust began to settle over the long summer, some clear winners and losers presented themselves..</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>WINNER: Tolteca</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tolteca, the spring chicken of the bunch, opened up in Suffolk Street (right beside Trinity) shortly after Christmas with a 5 euro deal for students, with a drink, which hardly seemed believable. The quality, which is generally considered &lsquo;ok&rsquo;, was compensated by the fact that there were unlimited refills. Over the summer, a two for one deal was launched which meant a burrito for 2.50 if you were lucky enough to own a friend. Tolteca has also made solid moves to attract more students, such as the provision of free wifi that doesn&rsquo;t suck and the inclusion of beer on the menu. The undisputed winner at reeling in students.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>WINNER: Boojum</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trinity chose Boojum as their winner of the wars last year. Boojum has everything going for it. The portions are more than decent, the food quality excellent and the place has an enviable air of &lsquo;cool&rsquo; about it. There&rsquo;s one brickbat though- Boojum is on the northside, further than most Trinity students would care to venture towards. Despite this, Boojum has cemented its reputation, which is well documented by the sheer volume of free vouchers societies have been scrabbling after for Freshers&rsquo; Week.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>NEITHER: Pablos</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ah Pablos, the closest comparison we have to a gourmet burrito. The portions are admittedly smaller than others. The choice is somewhat restricted. However, Pablos has won over a diehard army of fans who swear by its Sunny San Diego. Despite having two quite accessible locations for Trinity students, Pablos is yet to really reach the top, but its perilously close.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>NEITHER: Tuzo&rsquo;s</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tuzo&rsquo;s had somewhat of a false start after Christmas this year, with many reports of the worst fate that can befall a burrito, the collapse of the innards into a gooey mess. That said, Tuzo&rsquo;s has since improved and now has some excellent meat on offer. It has yet to win its way back into mainstream burrito business.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>NEITHER (but losing out): Little Ass</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pricey and small are sadly two words to describe Little Ass. It&rsquo;s slowly losing out on the limited interest it had for its impeccable quality. To even regain the same level of admiration as Tuzo&rsquo;s, prices have to drop.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>LOSER: Burrito and Blues</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Poor B and B. It&rsquo;s had a hard time of it since last year&rsquo;s Freshers&rsquo; week, when it seemed to be on the verge of capitalising on all that free voucher buzz. The less than quality ingredients coupled with a pricey 6.50 with a drink and the emergence of Tolteca has left it stranded at the back of the pack.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>LOSER: Mama&rsquo;s Revenge</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite being extremely close to the Hamilton and having quality burritos, Mama&rsquo;s Revenge has almost no part to play in the wars. \u00a0It needs to do something to gain a stake in that swelling market.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, the board is set. The pieces are moving back into the game. Will another player enter to take the hearts of hungry southside Dubliners? Will the burrito bubble finally burst and create a hole in the market for another vaguely ethnic foodstuff to enter into? Many questions with no answers, as the year begins and we herald the return of the war.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Boojum-Shopfront31.jpeg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19569", "Heading": "Burrito Wars: The Next Episode"}
