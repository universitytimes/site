{"Body": "<p>Two weeks ago I sat in this exact position staring at a blank canvas waiting to be inspired.&nbsp; Now as I look at the same canvas half filled with the colours of a dying sun setting over the busy streets of Dublin city I wonder how I am going to finish off this painting I have been working on for so long.&nbsp; Normally, I would have continued on as I started off, accurately applying shade, blending the colours accordingly but since this summer, my whole opinion on art has changed.</p>\n<p>On visiting the Museum of Modern Art in New York in August, I came across a painting called &lsquo;White on White&rsquo; by Kasimir Malevich, a painting of a white square on a white background. Painted in 1918, this type of art was innovative. My initial reaction to this apparent blank canvas was to laugh.&nbsp; This was not art! Anyone could paint a white square on a white canvas, that does not take talent, but anyone didn&rsquo;t paint it, no one had thought of painting a white square on a white canvas before, and that&rsquo;s what makes it art. That is what makes art art.</p>\n<p>I stood studying this painting until the museum closed, hardly making it past the entrance lobby.&nbsp; In those couple of hours looking at the white painting, my views on art changed dramatically.&nbsp; Whereas I would have always appreciated beautiful scenic paintings, full of detail and colour more than modern art which I often found boring, I was now beginning to see another side to it.&nbsp; I realise that art is not always about how accurate the shade is applied or the colours blended. Art is about doing about what no one has thought of doing before.&nbsp; Before Malevich there was no painting of white on white, not because no one thought it would make a good piece but because no one thought of it before.&nbsp; The reason it is such an extraordinary piece of art is because it was so revolutionary for its time.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Now looking at my painting before me, I decide not to finish as I started off.&nbsp; I no longer feel that the most beautiful painting is the best work of art.&nbsp; Anyone with half a talent can look out the window and paint what they see. It takes a true creative genius to create new concepts in their work, so wanting to be a creative genius I take up my brush, dip it in red paint and begin to splash it across the canvas.</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>Two weeks ago I sat in this exact position staring at a blank canvas waiting to be inspired.&nbsp; Now as I look at the same canvas half filled with the colours of a dying sun setting over the busy streets of Dublin city I wonder how I am going to finish off this painting I have been working on for so long.&nbsp; Normally, I would have continued on as I started off, accurately applying shade, blending the colours accordingly but since this summer, my whole opinion on art has changed.</p>\n<p>On visiting the Museum of Modern Art in New York in August, I came across a painting called &lsquo;White on White&rsquo; by Kasimir Malevich, a painting of a white square on a white background.
