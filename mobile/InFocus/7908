But it also raises other questions &ndash; some concrete and some more abstract &ndash; which we have been unable to answer definitively in researching the story. Here are some of the most important.\n\n<em>Are &lsquo;contracts of indefinite duration&rsquo; (CIDs) permanent?</em>\n\nThis is the pertinent question of the dispute between IFUT and College. IFUT would point to previous Labour Court rulings that afforded the status of permanency to the contracts and to government agencies in the area of employment using the term <a href=\"http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/types_of_employment/full_time_employment/types_of_employment.html\">&ldquo;permanent&rdquo;</a> to describe CIDs.\n\nCollege&rsquo;s position on this is more interesting. On November 18th, 2011 Dr. Eoin O&rsquo;Sullivan and Prof. Robbie Gilligan, the current and previous Head of School for Social Work and Social Policy sent a letter to Human Resources. The letter was also circulated to staff members in the school. It states &ldquo;for many years the College position, as relayed to us by the Human Resources office, in relation to Contracts of Indefinite Duration (CIDs) was that such staff had the same status as tenured or cista staff and assurances were given by us to staff on the basis of this advice.&rdquo; It continues &ldquo;this position has clearly changed but this was not communicated to Heads of School in any formal manner and we are concerned how this change of position emerged, and the consequences for staff across the university.&rdquo;\n\nRecently-elected Provost, Patrick Prendergast&rsquo;s, position during the election campaign was in line with the previously referenced College policy above &ndash; that CIDs were permanent contracts. So, has college&rsquo;s position on CIDs changed? Has the Provost&rsquo;s? And, if so, when, why and what is the new position?\n\nDr. O&rsquo;Sullivan and Prof. Gilligan&rsquo;s letter continues to criticise Human Resources for &ldquo;simply going through the motions&rdquo; and characterise the process leading up to redundancy as &ldquo;misjudged&rdquo;. It also describes the redundancy payments offered in this case as &ldquo;miserly&rdquo;.\n\nCollege&rsquo;s decision not to respond to question by The University Times for reasons of staff confidentiality and ongoing Labour Court proceedings makes it difficult to confirm what their arguments are. But correspondence on the matter we have seen indicates two possibilities: either CIDs are permanent but college is arguing that they can still make staff redundant if the stream of funding their job depends on dries up or CIDs are not permanent, they are somewhere between permanent and temporary contracts.\n\nIf College succeeds in arguing the second point either in the Labour Court or in a higher court at a later date then it has important ramifications for the status of people on CIDs across the public service (and, potentially, beyond).\n\nIf they don&rsquo;t take this approach then there&rsquo;s some questions to be asked in the university: can all permanent staff now be made redundant? If not, who can? Over 1,100 of the staff College<a href=\"http://www.tcd.ie/Communications/Facts/staff-numbers.php\"> acknowledges</a> as its 2,860 full-time staff are funded by &ldquo;non-core funding&rdquo;. Are these subject to compulsory redundancy? The answers to these questions will resonate across Irish universities and the public sector at large.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_7942\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Brendan Howlin, Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, after Croke Park Agreement talks in June.

Most public sector unions will have entered into the deal under the understanding that they were &ndash; particularly based on government agencies&rsquo; stances and Labour Court rulings.\n\nThe Croke Park Agreement is not legally binding, and its process has involved different separate agreements. IFUT, for instance, did not sign up to the deal until bilateral negotiations with the Department satisfied them that the deal protected their members. It may not be easy to find a yes or no answer to this question. But in a bilateral agreement interpretation is often the important determinant. IFUT clearly believe that the redundancies were in breach. In an article in The Irish Times on Monday they accused College of breaking the agreement in <a href=\"http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0123/1224310627169.html\">&ldquo;spectacular fashion&rdquo;</a>. And there are strong indications that ICTU agree. That is enough to threaten the Agreement.\n\n<em>&ldquo;Supported by&rdquo; or &ldquo;conditional on&rdquo;?</em>\n\nA point of contention likely to be resolved in the Labour Court relates to the wording of the employees&rsquo; contracts. The documents say that the positions are &ldquo;supported&rdquo; by a specific stream of &ldquo;non-core funding&rdquo;. The letters of dismissal issued by the college to the staff members said that the positions were conditional upon this funding. The two sides in the dispute will likely debate the meaning of these terms.\n\n<em>What is core-funding?</em>\n\nThere might be a definitive answer to this question &ndash; which we asked College &ndash; but none has been forthcoming.\n\nIn the past core-funding has referred to the funding provided by the students enrolled in the college &ndash; although how this has been allocated within the college has varied. Is there an established process for how this funding is allocated? This is now a very important question. If CID staff funded by &ldquo;non-core funding&rdquo; are vulnerable to redundancy, is there a mechanism in place to make sure that funding cannot be reallocated to target a specific CID staff member?\n\nCollege used the term &ldquo;external&rdquo; to describe funding tied to the contracts of the staff made redundant. What was the external funding? If it was private funding there are discussions determining a staff member&rsquo;s position entirely on a private, external funding stream and whether this will further deepen the ties between academic research and profitability.\n\nThere are questions here for the unions, too. Will public sector unions consider &ldquo;external&rdquo; funding derived from the public purse different, in terms of application to the Croke Park Agreement, than that derived from private funds? Will they seek to initiate a more comprehensive and broad-ranging discussion on the growing market influence in Ireland&rsquo;s public university system?\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_7943\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"What is the status of tenure? (Image: Ed Nacional)\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=7943\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7943\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7943\" title=\"RFD-Tenure-01\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/RFD-Tenure-01-300x232.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"232\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n<em>What is the status of tenure?</em>\n\nThe debate around the nature of tenure is ongoing. The Irish Universities Association &ndash; comprised of university Presidents &ndash; want to <a href=\"http://www.iua.ie/media-and-events/press-releases/releases/2007/IUAStatementonCrokeParkFeb2011.html\">define tenure</a> in line with currently existing employment legislation. The term &lsquo;tenure&rsquo;, they argue, dates from an era before job security was codified by this legislation and shouldn&rsquo;t be seen as something with greater significance than job permanency. Its use now is basically to be related to membership of a permanent academic club.\n\nLecturers&rsquo; unions and labour academics tend to tie tenure to academic freedom and argue that it has far greater significance. The well-established argument for tenure being more than simply a permanent job is that academia is in a position where the need to work free from the threat of redundancy or sacking is especially important. The free pursuit of knowledge and information, the argument goes, could easily bring an academic into conflict with his or her superiors and they need to be protected from this by very solid job security. What is often pejoratively described as a &lsquo;job for life&rsquo; is a way of ensuring academic freedom. And, following this logic, the recent redundancies threaten a wider principle of academic freedom by casualising academic labour and reducing job security for academics.\n\nThe issue of tenure has yet to be definitively resolved by Irish courts. This dispute, however, could have important ramifications for the debate. College may seek to make a distinction between permanent contracts (definite and indefinite duration) or to define CIDs as a form of hybrid between temporary and permanent jobs within the university. If it successfully does so not only will a formal division be introduced between staff in permanent positions but those with permanent contracts that are not subject to involuntary redundancy will have a form of tenure while those on the other permanent contracts will not. It will no longer be possible to argue that tenure &ndash; if it exists at all &ndash; is simply membership of a permanent academic club. The debate on this issue will be forced into realignment.\n\n<em>What is the status of the Croke Park Agreement?</em>\n\nThe Croke Park Public Service Agreement has been controversial from its inception. Those on the Right of Irish politics say it makes it impossible to cut wasteful spending in a bloated public service. Those on the Left say it formalises acceptance of austerity on behalf of unions and accepts that the public service are punished for a crisis that they did not cause. But, for those divorced from the ideological debate or looking for moderate or practical solutions that prevent further instability, its offer of relative industrial peace with reform and cuts is valuable.\n\nOn Sunday a group of <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/national-news/end-croke-park-deal-fg-rebels-tell-enda-2996213.html\">seven Fine Gael TDs</a> told the Sunday Independent that the deal should be scrapped altogether. This follows days of speculation that FG rebels have been putting pressure on Enda Kenny to scrap the deal and take on a more confrontational stance with public sector workers and their unions. However later that day Brian Hayes, Minister of State at the Department of Finance and one of the more Right-leaning Fine Gael front-liners, <a href=\"http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/john-drennan/john-drennan-croke-park-deal-stays-as-long-as-it-works-howlin-2973047.html\">echoed</a> his government colleague Brendan Howlin in dismissing as <a href=\"http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/hayes-scrapping-croke-park-deal-would-be-nonsensical-536889.html\">&ldquo;nonsensical&rdquo;</a> calls for the deal to be annulled. (Hayes had previously said the deal needed to be implemented with greater <a href=\"http://www.thejournal.ie/public-sector-reforms-need-more-urgency-to-succeed-hayes-326205-Jan2012/\">\"urgency\"</a>.)Both men said that, as long as the targets were being met, the deal was working and should be maintained.\n\nThe Croke Park Agreement has, thus far, survived because it is part of a culture of consensus that has been highly influential in Irish politics since the Celtic Tiger period. It follows in the tradition of the corporatist &lsquo;social partnership&rsquo; agreements between the economy&rsquo;s big players &ndash; government, unions (ICTU) and business leaders (IBEC) &ndash; and fits with the narrative that &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all in this together&rdquo;. It remains to be seen how long this culture can continue as Europe faces down a prolonged period of economic stagnation and political turmoil.\n\nThis dispute in Trinity is of great importance for the future of the deal, as much for the reaction of the parties involved to the Labour Court decision which will follow as the decision itself. Public sector unions entered into the agreement to protect permanent jobs in the public service. Many of the staff they represent in the public service are on CIDs (another important question which may be answered soon: how many?). If CIDs are permanent contracts and staff on them can be made involuntarily redundant then it will make the position of public sector unions within the Croke Park Agreement process increasingly untenable.\n\nBut the Agreement would also be put in jeopardy by any decision which recognises CIDs as permanent &ndash; and which the government enforces by commiting college not to make staff on them involuntarily redundant. If College has to retain CID staff even when the stream of funding which had paid for their contract dries up it will place on them significant financial pressures &ndash; pressures which would also apply to other organisations in similar positions. There is a proportional relationship here: as the conflicting interests involved become more defined the resolution of the conflict in the consensus framework will become increasingly difficult.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_7944\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Brian Hayes, Minister of State for Public Service Reform and the Office of Public Works, said there was a need for more &quot;urgency&quot; in implementing the Croke Park Agreement but that scrapping it would be &quot;nonsensical&quot;.\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=7944\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7944\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7944\" title=\"Pcall-96-BRIAN-HAYES00122225-390x285\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Pcall-96-BRIAN-HAYES00122225-390x285-300x219.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"219\" /></a>[/caption]\n\n<em>Could IFUT go on strike?</em>\n\nAttempts will be made to resolve this dispute in the Labour Court in March. There&rsquo;s also a chance of intervention from the Department of Education. It&rsquo;s likely that significant efforts will be made to prevent IFUT going on strike.\n\nBut, at the moment, IFUT have stalled their engagement with a process designed to stop industrial action. How this dispute is resolved is important for the job security of staff members in many universities on CIDs. If this pattern of compulsory redundancies for CID staff continues there&rsquo;s a strong chance.\n\n<em>Is there a larger process at play here?</em>\n\nLecturers&rsquo; unions have argued for some time that there is a process of casualisation of academic labour, tied to the neoliberalisation of higher-level education, underway at the moment.\n\nCertainly these redundancies, and the wider consequences for job security in the university, could be contextualised by other events. Last year a <a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=769\">University Times investigation</a> revealed a practice, sanctioned by college, where senior academics bought out extensive (or entire) teaching portions of their contracts with external research funding.\n\nThe investigation produced evidence of specific instances where Professors and other senior academics were replaced by contract lecturers who were not in possession of a PhD. In the course of researching the story, the paper spoke to some of those hired as contract lecturers to do replacement teaching and averaged the cost they were being paid per module to around &euro;3,000. This contrasts with the yearly salaries of the Professors (&euro;108 &ndash; 138k), Associate Professors (&euro;79 - 105k) or Senior Lecturers (&euro;70 &ndash; 89k) who they could be asked to replace.\n\nAcademic contracts in Trinity College are not specifically broken down by task. However, a notional division of tasks was articulated by Ned Costello, CEO of the Irish Universities&rsquo; Association, at a September 23rd, 2010, meeting of the Oireachtas Public Accounts Committee. He quoted the division of forty per cent teaching, forty per cent research and twenty per cent administration.\n\nUnions that represent academics have strongly resisted a formalised breakdown of tasks in a workload model, but it provides a certain basis for comparison. If we accept that the &euro;3,000 per module model includes some administration, the lowest-paid Professor would have to teach eighteen modules a year to earn his or her salary, and this would be before any research.\n\nThe current dispute ties in with questions about casualisation of labour, the relative importance of teaching and research, and the nature of college funding. It also fits with a broader discussion of how college adapts to a neoliberal political and austere economic climate.\n\n<em>Further questions</em>\n\nThere are plenty of other questions posed by the dispute too: have any non-union members on CIDs been made involuntarily redundant? What is the Department of Education&rsquo;s position? Are there internal differences within the Department &ndash; as could be inferred from the letters of support Mike Jennings says were received from within the Department by the staff who had been made redundant? Perhaps the most interesting, and the one that could see this story prolonged longest is this: Could we see the issues brought up by this case\u00a0end up before the High Court?", "Imageurl": "7954", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "7908", "Heading": "Compulsory Redundancy Dispute Raises Important Questions"}
