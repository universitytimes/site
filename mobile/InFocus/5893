Since then it has spread across the globe.\u00a0 Last year Ireland raised &euro;1.6 million.\n\n1<sup>st</sup> of November is the start of the 30 day long project where the participants, also known as Mo Bros, can register with a cleaned shaved face. The rest of the month they will be growing their moustaches, in any shapes or sizes, supported by the women in their lives, the Mo Sisters.\n\nThe money they raise goes to The Irish Cancer Society.\n\nMovember Ireland has been on tour around the country to get students involved in the initiative.\n\nMany universities are organising Movember Parties and other events to engage their students.\n\n&ldquo;We have visited colleges in Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick.&rdquo; Said Dave Byrne, from the PR agency Thinkhouse, who is organising Movember Ireland.\n\n&ldquo;One of our biggest challenges is to get people to register at our web site. A lot of students grow the moustache, but don&rsquo;t register.&rdquo; Dave said.\n\nYou can choose to be a part of the college team or join as an individual student.\n\n&ldquo;I think the initiative is very appealing to students, because if there is any time young men can grow a moustache without complaints, it's in college. It sounds like a fun idea to make a college team.&rdquo; Jack Jonasson added.\n\nThere are more than 30,000 people diagnosed with cancer in Ireland every year. 2,500 of them are men with prostate cancer. This makes it the second most common cancer for men in Ireland. Movember's goal is to make people more aware about men's health, and to make men talk more openly about their problems.\n\nThey want to create awareness about a serious subject, whit a funny twist.\n\nOnce registered they are advised to email friends, family and local businesses, asking for support.\n\n\"Rod Scanlan decided to join the project and let his moustache grow last November. He managed to raise &euro;950. &ldquo;I made the money through sponsorship cards I downloaded from the website and also sent a link around on email and on my Facebook status to friends and family to lodge money into my Movember account.&rdquo;\n\nTo get more people involved they launch competitions online, where the participants can upload photos of the process. Some of the titles you can win this year are Best Mo in Character, Team Mo, Miss Movember, and Man of Movember.\n\n&ldquo;The plot is great. My experience is that it really got people thinking and talking about prostate cancer. Some people thought my moustache was cool, others thought I looked scary. But it all added to more awareness as it got people talking about it which were the purpose of it. And then they donated money after seeing the effort I went to.&rdquo; Rod said.\n\nMovember, the month once known as November, has achieved great success since it started eight years ago. So far 1.1 million Mo Brothers and Sisters from all over the world have raised &euro;123 million. Movember has also started Movember Global Action Plan, for doctors and scientist to work together globally, for the fight against prostate cancer. This way they can share knowledge, results and resources across the borders.\n\nWhen Movember comes to an end they host a number of Gala Part\u00e9s, both in Ireland and the rest of the world. These events are held to thank all the participants for their help.", "Imageurl": "5895", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5893", "Heading": "Moustache Season"}
