Russian out-half Rachkov was sent to the sin bin for a cynical and deliberate knock-on and Ireland took absolute advantage as McFadden chased down O'Gara's chipped kick and finished\u00a0coolly.\n\nO'Gara had no problems\u00a0adding\u00a0the extras, nor did he when given the responsibility after Jennings powered over from close-range. Scrum-half Boss stretched every inch of his short frame to touch down against the post's padding.\n\nThe bonus point was secured before the half-hour as Earls sprinted into the corner and Trimble finished opportunely after another bout of cynical Russian play perversely afforded him an advantage.\n\nAndrei Garbuzov, who had not made up his defensive yards, knocked the ball into Trimble's path and he kicked ahead and gathered calmly for a try.\n\nAnd the impressive Earls marked his brace with a surging run that saw him break two tackles and storm over for a converted try.\n\nThe game was ultimately one of positives for Declan Kidney's side, but the pragmatist will no doubt be concerned by the ease with which Artemyev sliced through the Irish defence for his score. Simplikevich, fittingly, found the task of beating the green shirts similarly straightforward.\n\nThe game was already long over as a contest, but Ireland had the chance to pour on more points as Russia faded having played three games in the last eleven days. Kearney strolled over before Jennings and Buckley worked their way past the line in the dying stages of a free-flowing game.", "Imageurl": "4718", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4717", "Heading": "Ireland too strong for Russia"}
