Before being their employer, she had always been their friend and their student. And this is how a lawyer managed to become a succesful fashion designer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong><strong>Tell us about what you do...</strong></span></em></span></h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=7381\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7381\"><img class=\"alignleft size-medium wp-image-7381\" title=\"paula del vas 3\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/paula-del-vas-3-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>For the past 12 years I have had a studio where we design and produce tailored made dresses, bags, shoes &amp; fascinators and, recently, we have been working on a project for a new franchise, dedicated to a high end <em>pret-a-porter </em>line, always for women.\n\nAt our studio, I also design wedding dresses: they are designed in unique pieces and then, hand made, one by one, by all the staff I work with (10 to 15 people). Over the past couple of years, we have been showing our collections at Cibeles Madrid Fashion Week - <a href=\"http://pauladelvas.wordpress.com/\">http://pauladelvas.wordpress.com/</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong><strong>How did you end up doing it?</strong></span></em></h4>\nWell, I studied and graduated in law and then I worked in the Spanish judicial administration for several years. It came the day when my sister, who was a fashion designer, asked me if I wanted to start collaborating with her. I thought &ndash; why not? - and in 12 years, I am now about to open my own franchised brand, on a completely self taught basis. However, during the course of the years, I realised how important techniques were, and I have tried to fill a few of the gaps through training courses and workshops.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </strong><strong>Where are you from originally &amp; what has taken you where you live now?</strong></span></em></span></h4>\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight: normal;\">I am originally from Argentina. In 1977, my family moved to Spain for political reasons, and so I grew up in Murcia, hometown of one of my grandfathers. It was during the Spanish civil that he fled Spain, while, the other way around, we had to go back to it. Since 1977, I've always lived in this small city in the south east of Spain, and that's where I am still based.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong><em>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em></strong><strong><em>Where else would you ever live? Why?</em></strong></span></h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=7382\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7382\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-7382\" title=\"paula del vas 5\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/paula-del-vas-5-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>Over the last 3 years, I have lived between Berlin and Murcia for many different reasons. I have a particular affection towards Berlin, due to its huge cultural movement: it allowed me to significantly widen the perspectives and the horizons regarding art more in general. Among other things, the chance to fly there and select new and different materials, new and different machines was just a great contribution that always allowed me to go back to Murcia, not only with many innovative ideas, but with many interesting techniques and materials to try out for my project.\n\nHowever, I&rsquo;d love to have some spare time to live in London for a while!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong><em>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em></strong><strong><em>What has contributed the most towards what you have achieved?</em></strong></span></h4>\nWithout any doubts, I can say that the friends I found through my job (some of them worked with me ) is what helped the most towards my achievements. One of them, probably one of the most influencing, is my really good friend Catalina: she is 87 now, she used to a nun and I met her while queuing on the way to buy fabrics at a shop. She needed them too as she used to make hats while in the monastery. It was her who taught me basically everything on hat tailoring techniques.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong><em>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em></strong><strong><em>At the age of 20, what did you think you were going to do &ldquo;in life&rdquo; - where did you see yourself in the future?

However, you learn that life hides surprises and can take many different paths and it offered me the chance to devote myself to fashion. The only thing I can say now is only that I really, really love my job!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong><em>7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</em></strong><strong><em>What projects are you currently working on?</em></strong></span></h4>\nThe franchise we have just opened, called EMEM by Paula del Vas, is taking up most of my time. It offers, among other things, wedding dresses, cocktail dresses and every type of accessory for women clothing. The first shop opened in Murcia last week (<a href=\"http://vmagazinespain.com/2011/12/paula-del-vas/\">http://vmagazinespain.com/2011/12/paula-del-vas/</a>), and, over the next few years, we are planning to expand all over Spain. All the clothes I have designed are divided in two collections &ndash; one is a lot more formal &ndash; called &ldquo;Fiesta&rdquo; - and a more casual one &ndash; &ldquo;Sastreria&rdquo;.\n\nWe have also been paying a lot of attention to the design of the shop &ndash; I have picked my very good friend Vicente Martinez Gadea to do it. He is a very renowned architect and what I wanted to make sure was that the shop became an art space and a beautiful place to enter.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong><em>8.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em></strong><strong><em>If you could meet any artist &ndash; living or dead &ndash; who would it be?</em></strong></span></h4>\nIt would certainly be Alberto Giacometti. I have read many books on his creative process, and it seems extremely interesting to me.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong><em>9.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </em></strong><strong><em>And finally, what are you hoping will get you your &ldquo;15 minutes of fame&rdquo;?</em></strong></span></h4>\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/?attachment_id=7384\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-7384\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-7384 alignright\" title=\"paula del vas 7\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/paula-del-vas-73-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>I had never thought about it &ndash; but that's probably because I never really worried to have my &ldquo;15 minutes of fame&rdquo;!!\n\n&nbsp;\n<h4><span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong><em>The traveller corner &ndash;\u00a0 Paula's tips if you were to go to Murcia</em></strong></span></h4>\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Art Gallery</span>:</em></strong>\u00a0T20 (<a href=\"http://www.galeriat20.com/\">http://www.galeriat20.com/</a>)\n\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Theatre</span>: </em></strong>Romea (<a href=\"http://www.teatreromea.com/c/start.aspx\">http://www.teatreromea.com/c/start.aspx</a>)\n\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Band</span>:</em></strong><em> </em>Second (<a href=\"http://www.second.es/\">http://www.second.es/</a>)\n\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Gig venue</span>: </em></strong>La Mar de Musicas (<a href=\"http://www.lamardemusicas.com/\">http://www.lamardemusicas.com/</a>)\n\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Area of the city</span>: </em></strong>el paseo de \"el Malecon\" (<a href=\"http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=c,522,m,168&amp;r=CeAP-2322-C_670_DETALLE_CENTRO\">http://www.regmurcia.com/servlet/s.Sl?sit=c,522,m,168&amp;r=CeAP-2322-C_670_DETALLE_CENTRO</a> )\n\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Shop</span>:</em></strong>\u00a0Coco Factory\n\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Cafe</span>:</em></strong>\u00a0Cafe El Arco (<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150315211847032&amp;set=a.10150315210797032.338188.318681882031&amp;type=3&amp;theater#!/media/set/?set=a.10150315210797032.338188.318681882031&amp;type=3\">http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150315211847032&amp;set=a.10150315210797032.338188.318681882031&amp;type=3&amp;theater#!/media/set/?set=a.10150315210797032.338188.318681882031&amp;type=3</a>)\n\n<strong><em><span style=\"color: #993366;\">Hostel/B&amp;B</span>:</em></strong>\u00a0Hostal La Catedral\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "7380", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "7379", "Heading": "&ldquo;Panorama&rdquo; - Our little window on young European emerging art: Paula del Vas"}
