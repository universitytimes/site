I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what could ever be that bad to force someone to think that death was the only escape. Suicide cannot be undone.

It is the end of friendships forged over years.

Those that injure themselves consider self-harming to appear somewhere in the middle. Self-harmers use pain as a release. They would never consider suicide, and it is just a way of releasing pent up emotions, a chance to liberate their inner turmoil. Committing suicide is ending things permanently. Self-harmers just want a &lsquo;quick-fix&rsquo; to make themselves feel a little better.

As in the case of suicide the victim sees it as the only possible way to resolve their suffering. Although the NOSP is taking large steps towards suicide and self-harming prevention, as a country it is our responsibility to provide an adequate Mental Health Service that ensures that no individual ever gets to the point where they think harming themselves is the only way to make themselves feel better or that ending their own life is the only answer to their problems. A strong counselling service is needed alongside proper education about the importance of positive mental health.

We need to stand together and accept that life is hard. We need to acknowledge that there will always be times when we cannot cope on our own.
