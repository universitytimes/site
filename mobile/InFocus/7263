The search was still ongoing with hopes that Caolan would be found alive.\n\nI cannot comprehend the anguish this must have caused for all of his friends, family and others connected to him. We in TCDSU are acutely aware of the unnecessary harm caused by the article to the students of our college that knew Caolan, and at this time our thoughts are with all those that knew wherever they are.\n\nOn behalf of the students of Trinity College Dublin I am requesting that the paper issue an apology to all those who knew Caolan for the appalling story that was printed last Sunday.\n\nI must also inform you that all sales of the Irish Daily Mail and the Irish Mail on Sunday from our campus outlets have been suspended, as directed by the TCDSU representatives, pending an apology to the family and friends of Caolan Mulrooney, and a review of this apology at a future SU Council.\n\nI eagerly await your response and hope to see an apology issued soon.\n\nRegards,\n\nRyan Bartlett\nTCDSU President\n\n</div></blockquote>", "Imageurl": "7270", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "7263", "Heading": "The Irish Daily Mail responds to Bartlett's letter"}
