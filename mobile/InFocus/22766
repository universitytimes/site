{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>David Burns</strong> | Contributing Writer</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">I look at my CV like we&rsquo;re at dinner after having broken up. The truth is my bosses burned down all the bridges that once ran between us. My non-renewable contract at La Sorbonne Nouvelle is drawing to a close, and the university along with it. Paris III, the name by which it is more commonly known, will shut down in 2016. Programmes are in place for a new college, an amalgamation of four pre-existing faculties, set to open around the same time. However, as with everything in the third level education system, the organization is a dog&rsquo;s dinner. The only thing clear to me is that in the autumn of 2014 I will be out of a job, and my CV is looking a lot like Lewis Carroll&rsquo;s Cheshire Cat.</p>\r\nI feel like the employee version of a Black Widow. I&rsquo;m hardworking, I&rsquo;ve had a job since I was 16, but everywhere that has taken me on has since shut. This is perhaps something to keep quiet, but there&rsquo;s not much left to lose. Just ask the Wexford Art&rsquo;s Centre caf\u00e9, D&rsquo;Lush, where I started.\r\n\r\nEvery Christmas Eve after I got to college, I spent running food in Chatham Brasserie. The owner took me on, but only after I got a haircut, and with the recommendation of my old boss in Wexford. They both had a history in catering. They both treated me well. The summer before I left for France with my degree and a job in Paris, Gerry found me a place in his brother&rsquo;s restaurant Frankie&rsquo;s Steakhouse. I worked the days in one and the nights in the other. When I left for Paris, with an envelope full of cash, Gerry gave me two grand in holiday pay and a letter of recommendation.\r\n<blockquote>I feel like the employee version of a Black Widow</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My arrival in the City of Lights scared the hell out of me. Rent is sky high here. Everywhere is so expensive. A pint is &euro;7. I got work in an Irish bar called The Cool\u00edn. The letter of recommendation and the restaurants on my CV convinced the owner, and he hired me. I continued the routine started over the summer as long as I could and then, after finding and furnishing a studio, I gave my notice. The boss took it well and allowed me go home for Christmas. The Cool\u00edn will close December 2014.</p>\r\nThe contract I&rsquo;m currently on at Paris III is what the French call a CDD. Roughly translated, &lsquo;a contract of pre-determined duration&rsquo;. The next place I&rsquo;ll go looks to be South Korea. They pay well for English teachers there, and that&rsquo;s the only thing still on my CV. I&rsquo;ll need to stay there for a while to accumulate experience. Otherwise, when next I move, there won&rsquo;t be much to put to paper. I&rsquo;ve been lucky all my working life, but right now the cracks are widening under me and given the breadth of places closing, I can&rsquo;t be the only one slipping through.\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Irish Government believes young people to be resilient. We are. The Irish Government believes young people should be in work or education. I don&rsquo;t think anyone would disagree. However, what the Irish Government and other governments lack is experience. They didn&rsquo;t grow up in the current crisis, although their generation caused it. Consequently, they don&rsquo;t understand the nuanced nature of the challenges posed. They fail to appreciate that you can have tried your hardest only to find the ground you&rsquo;re standing on disappearing from under you.</p>\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/HMV1.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22766", "Heading": "Everywhere I've Ever Worked Has Closed"}
