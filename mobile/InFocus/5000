Now to mourn what could have been.</strong>\n<strong>80 min:</strong>\u00a0Wales are through to the Semi after a brilliant performance and a masterclass in exploiting opponents weakness.\n\n<strong>79 min</strong>: Suffice to say Wales have won already. It's now a matter of pride. And to be fair the team never stop trying. O'Driscoll knocks forward what quite possibly could be his last touch of a ball in a RWC.\n\n<strong>75-77 min</strong>: Irish Line out in the 22, nearly lost it. Welsh tactical defense is nigh on\u00a0impenetrable. The lads look out of focus, out of sorts and distraught.\n\n<strong>74 min</strong>: Ryan and Leamy on for Heaslip and Ferris.\n\n<strong>73min</strong> : Penalty yet again comes off the post. Kearney gathers and game play resumes as Ireland Kick their way up back into the welsh 22, only to yet again be pushed back.\n\n<strong>72 min</strong>: Yet another penalty goes to Wales after pressure is upped on Ireland. Is it too early to start drowning my sorrows?\n\n<strong>71 min</strong> : Trimble on for try scorer Earls.\n\n<strong>70 min:</strong> a stolen line out by O'Connell is then lost almost immediately to Jones, Bowe collects a kick, nearly gets a break then fumbles the ball and knocks it forward. Skies have opened and conditions have worsened considerably. Like my mood.\n\n<strong>68 min:</strong> Intense phase of Irish attack, with almost every player touching the ball see's us come away scoreless.\n\n<strong>65 min:</strong> Converted. Wales lead 22-10. Heart broken over here.\n\n<strong>64 min:</strong> Davies over the try line after several missed tackles. WALES TRY. 20-10\n\n<strong>58min</strong>: Priestland kicks the Penalty but it hit's off the post. Ireland narrowly avoid falling behind by two scores. Need for a score soon cannot be stressed enough.\n\n<strong>57 min:</strong> Wales starting to dominated the scrum. Ross looking tired. But Healy is the one who gives away the penalty.\n\n<strong>55 min:\u00a0</strong>Substitutions. O'Gara off, Sexton on. Conor Muarry replaced by Eoin Reddan.\n\n<strong>54 min:</strong> Disgraceful pass from Rodge misses Best and could have been very dangerous. Sexton anyone?\n\n<strong>51min:</strong> Priestland misses the conversion. Score remains 15-10\n\n<strong>50min:</strong> Philips darts down the blind side from inside the from a ruck inside the Irish 22. Gets the Try. 15-10.\n\n<strong>46 min</strong>: Earls now down after Roberts Tackle... Davies misses O'Brien get the turnover and O'Gara kicks us back into the Welsh half.\n\n<strong>45 min:</strong> TRY GIVEN! O'Gara converts. WE'RE LEVEL!!! 10-10\n\n<strong>44min:</strong> Multiple Phases, Earls looks like he''s gotten over for a try after great team play by Ireland and a pass from Ferris, but TMO decision pending... Feet look out of touch.\n\n<strong>43 min:</strong> BOD aims a kick into the 22, chased by Earls.\n\n<strong>42 min</strong>: Second Half gets off to a start with some poor Irish kicking from Bowe and Kearney.\n\n<strong>HT:</strong> Wales 10 -3 Ireland. Welsh defense is solid and they seem to have a game plan designed to hit us hard. Key players are having magnificent games. Priestland, Halfpenny, Wyn-Jones and Philips in particular to name but a few. Irish players look nervous. Our usual open play is stagnant, there's a failure to support any line breaks. Not to mention some lethal looking tackles going in. If the peak into the players dressing room means anything, Les Kiss (Irish Defense coach) looks about as worked up as the rest of us.\n\n<strong>39 min:</strong> Jones takes down O'Connell. And we're in for HT.\n\n<strong>38 min</strong>: O'Driscoll earns us a turnover. Charter is down, with what looks like a serious injury but tentatively gets up and continues play.\n\n<strong>36 min:</strong> Rodge over estimates yet another kick. It's not like it's the reason he was picked or anything.\n\n<strong>33 min</strong>: Serious play from Ireland has upped the pressure on key Welsh Players. O'Callaghan steals the Welsh Lineout. But Wales win the turnover in the ruck.\n\n<strong>28 min</strong>: Halfpenny Penalty almost from the halfway mark. So much for the wind issue. 10-3.\n\n<strong>24 min</strong>:Ireland are (at last) on the scoreboard. PEN O'Gara. 7-3 to Wales\n\n<strong>21min:</strong> Kick goes bring play into the 22 again. Welsh Line Out. Ireland are going to regret coming away scoreless after so many opportunity. Kearney break but was isolated immediately and taken down by Roberts.\n\n<strong>18min:</strong> O'Gara fumbled the ball right in front of the try line, gave away possession and Halfpenny nearly broke away.\n\n<strong>16 min:</strong> O'BRIEN! Over the try line but was held up by Shane Wiliams\n\n16<strong>\u00a0min:</strong> another penalty to the corner as wind is strong.\n\n<strong>15 min:</strong> ANOTHER tackle after North missed. BOD intercepts a pass. D'Arcy gets a break but doesn't have the support. Team effort got us into the Welsh 22.\n\n<strong>12 min</strong>: Forced back and Welsh turnover. Serious tackles going in. Verging on illegal? Knock on in the line out have given the Welsh the scrum.\n\n<strong>9 min:</strong> Conditions aren't the best which explains the corner kicking. Set pieces looking strong. HEALY- almost over... Heart can't take this stres....\n\n<strong>7 min: </strong>Penalty to Ireland coming from the break down got us into the Welsh 22 and we have the first period of Irish attack. Penalty to Ireland. And O'Gara's going for the corner.\n\n<strong>2 min:</strong> Williams over for a try! F***. Hard earned after after a turnover and across the pitch play.\n\n<strong>1 min :</strong>\u00a0O'Gara starts us off and already we've have a serious Welsh attack....\n\n<strong>05:57 </strong>No big deal... It's just a quarter final... Oh god. Let's get this show on the road shall we?", "Imageurl": "5064", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5000", "Heading": "Ireland v Wales - LIVE!"}
