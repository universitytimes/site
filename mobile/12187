This summer I chose Ireland as my setting for this indulgence. Having spent the previous summer in Washington DC and the year before traveling between Europe, West Africa and the Middle East, I was looking forward to enjoying the comfort of familiarity and the pleasure of spending time with close friends.\n\nAfter deciding to stay in Ireland I was anxious that my summer days be productive; I feared each day could slip into the next unaccounted for if I didn&rsquo;t steer my summer purposely. To that end I secured a two month internship in Leinster House with a Labour TD Ciara Conway.\u00a0 I&rsquo;ve been a member of the Labour Party since I started university. I was interested to intern with a young female TD as the lack of women represented in politics has for some time intrigued and perplexed me.\n\nInternships vary in regards to their quality but with Ciara I was trusted as a valued member of her team and put to serious work. A mixture of policy and secretarial tasks challenged my abilities and created space to develop my skill set. Beyond any practical benefits of working with Ciara, spending time in the office with her was thoroughly enjoyable as her warm and caring personality brightened up the working day and her sense of childish fun infected the people around her.\n\nLast summer, I interned on Capitol Hill with a Democratic Senator from New York &ndash; Sen. Charles Schumer.\u00a0 As compared, working in Leinster House was a refreshingly more enjoyable experience. The unpretentious amiable atmosphere in Leinster House compared favorably with my time on Capitol Hill. From an academic perspective, as a student of political Science, I was interested to observe the distinctions and similarities between the legislatures in the two political systems and note the impact of the institutional arrangements of each system on the day-to-day work of particular legislators.\n\nA benefit of staying within Ireland for the summer is staying abreast of current news stories and campaigning on injustices that strike a chord of outrage within one&rsquo;s heart. One such issue for me were the scandalous Youth Defence advertisements that appeared around Dublin recently. The regressive and reactionary politics underlying the advertisements shame campaign are an antithesis to my own politics of social inclusion, tolerance and equality. Based on the reaction to the billboards, the organisation&rsquo;s message was entirely at odds with most sound minded people in Dublin as well.\n\nThe sight of the posters in prominent locations all around Dublin invoked a swift reaction from outraged members of the public, I among them. We wrote to the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland, the billboard owning companies and our local representatives to voice our disgust and condemnation at the shameful tactics used by the reactionary right-wing, Church funded, regressive organisation. A pro-choice rally in Belfast and a protest against Youth Defence outside Leinster House were organised and well attended. I was proud to leave work the afternoon of the protest and walk out the gates of Leinster House with a number of Labour TD&rsquo;s to attend and reinforce our party&rsquo;s commitment to respecting a woman&rsquo;s right to choose.\n\nOf course Youth Defence&rsquo;s actions were in anticipation of the Expert Group&rsquo;s findings, due in September, which are widely expected to push Ireland to legislate for the Supreme Court ruling in X; a move likely to cause serious upheaval between the government coalition partners, potentially destabilising the government. I for one await with anticipation the political theatrics which will follow the expert group&rsquo;s conclusions and am ready to lobby both within and outside my party to ensure Labour holds true to its pro-choice commitment. It might not be the political expedient option but a candid enquiry of one&rsquo;s conscience should reveal legislating for a woman&rsquo;s right to end her pregnancy when it poses a risk to her life is surely the right thing to do.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy interest in politics led me to run for Chair of the Trinity Branch and International Officer on the national Labour Youth executive. Happily I was successful and both positions are keeping me busy this summer. \u00a0As with any society, planning during the summer for the coming year makes good sense and the Trinity Labour executive have met and put together some exciting events for next year. This year will be a tough year for Labour Youth recruitment so a big effort on the part of college branches is required if we are to attract new members.\n\nHolding the International Officer position entitles me to travel and represent the organisation at international events. As part of my duties this year, I led Labour Youth&rsquo;s commemoration for the young Norwegian Labour Party members killed at Utoya last year and led the party in a minutes silence remembrance at our summer school in Kilkenny. I am currently organising a Labour Youth trip to Brussels and am attending a Young Socialist celebration in France in August representing Labour Youth.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen I&rsquo;m not engaging in politics and need a respite from the city, I travel home to Kerry where I was brought up. The unassuming beauty of the beaches in Ballybunion, the rugged landscape of Dingle and the tranquillity in the bog lands surrounding Listowel are aspects of the county I miss while living in Dublin. A mini-break at home allows me to switch off from life in Dublin and it is a privilege I am fortunate to profit from.\n\nThe highlight of my summer thus far was watching Bruce Springsteen play live in the RDS. It wasn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;d seen him play live but this tour promoting his politically charged album <em>Wrecking Ball</em> was more special than the other times I&rsquo;d seen him play. As Ireland continues to experience the ravages of recession with youth unemployment at despairingly high rates, Springsteen captures my burning feelings of injustice in his songs but entwines them in fist-pumping entertainment. I remember the cheer rippling through the crowd when he sang one line in <em>Jack of All Trades</em>, a song to my mind about ordinary people making do in hard times. <em>&lsquo;If I had me a gun/I&rsquo;d find the bastards and shoot&rsquo;em on sight&rsquo;</em>, he sings of the bankers who acted with no regard for the destruction of working people&rsquo;s way of life when they recklessly sought their own self-aggrandisement.\n\nAt the beginning of the summer I was anxious that my summer in Ireland would be memorable. I worried about how it would compare with previous summers spent traveling to exotic unknown territories. While I maintain that travel is valuable in terms of broadening one&rsquo;s thoughts and seeking adventure; I have found that being within familiar surroundings has its own unique value. It&rsquo;s by no means the most glamorous story to tell but in terms of personal enjoyment I can genuinely say I&rsquo;ll remember this summer as the one filled with the happiest times of any before it.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "12194", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12187", "Heading": "500 Ways to Summer: An Irish Summer..."}
