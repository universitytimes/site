{"Body": "<strong>Jack Leahy</strong>\n<em>Elections Editor</em>\n\nIt's the last day of the election blog and while it's given me a great insight into how these sort of affairs operate, I'll be glad to return to an itinerary that involves attending class. That said, I have managed to avoid taking the advice of last year's election blogger Ian Curran to take solace in 'some sort of hard drug habit'.\n\nBecause campaigning has pretty much ceased at this stage, the primary content of this edition will be a response to comments made against UT's election coverage by Owen Bennett and others. There's some other stuff too, if that's what you're into.\n\nI'll start with the other stuff, affording those of you not bothered with the rest the chance to get out before you're dragged into it all.\n\nFollowing the release of a video entitled '<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNrNnuAvHJM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">Vote</a>!', criticisms emerged that the candidates featured in the video - Bennett, Rory Dunne, and David Whelan\u00a0- had combined to form a ticket. Dunne approached me today to clarify that the producers of the video rounded up any candidates they could find on campus before the hustings session at Halls on Monday and that neither he nor the other two had any interest in running as a ticket. Realistically, I find it hard to believe that the three had that in mind when they recorded the video.\n\nCampus and off-campus locations saw a ban on campaigning in the vicinity of polling areas, but that didn't stop\u00a0Dunne, Hannah Cogan, Emma Walker, Dan Ferrick, and Aisling N\u00ed Chonaire\u00a0- in descending order - nervously pacing the permitted areas of the arts block. I wouldn't suggest that any of those not in the arts block today were having a particularly easy day. At the end of it all, all eleven of the candidates have put a lot of effort into their campaigns to represent students, and for that they are all deserving of respect.\n\nVoting - enocuraged, I'd imagine, by <em>all </em>of the candidates - comes to a close tomorrow afternoon at 4pm, with the official count supposedly beginning at 6pm, definitely\u00a0taking place\u00a0at the Mont Clare Hotel on Merrion Square. For\u00a0the (at least) six losing candidates, the combination of\u00a0an early start in terms of drinking, weeks of late nights and early starts, and the sapping emotional investment involved in a campaign will make for an emotional evening. Can't imagine that the winning candidates will be any less afflicted by the above, mind you.\n\nSo, onto business. Communications candidate Bennett has criticised UT's coverage of elections and, this being my responsibility, I want to address a number points that have entered the dialogue.\n\nFirst of all, the idea that I and I alone am in charge of producing 2000+ words a day of election coverage is absurb. While I will pre-approve, add to, and stand behind every word that makes it into the blog, there are dedicated correspondents charged with canvassing student opinion every day. Three of the five - including communications correspondent Fionn O'Dea - have never had any involvement with the SU, are in their first year of writing for the paper, and didn't know any candidates in their race prior to assignment. There are no vested interests. For my own part, I invite Owen\u00a0- who has 'recommended' the blog\u00a0at least twice - to paste into the 'comments' section any portion of any election blog he considers to be unfair and to qualify with hard evidence his assertion that there has been\u00a0a ''running theme of bias in the UT&rsquo;s reporting on these elections''.\n\nFurthermore, I do not respect the authority of any\u00a0comment-poster\u00a0who has never met me to tell me who my friends are and where my interests lie. If you are looking for a member of senior UT staff who does not have a friendly relationship with at least one of the candidates in\u00a0the election then you will be looking for a long time. Absolute neutrality is an impractical goal in student journalism; you have to do the best that you can and I'll maintain that we have done so. If any candidate feels they have been treated unfairly they are welcome to make their case to both me and the editor, Ronan Costello, who has approved all blog posts and overseen all of our coverage.\n\nI won't comment on anything on the matter featured in yesterday's blog; I didn't research or compose any of it and my relationship with Tom Lowe since our shared school days\u00a0is such that I couldn't offer an opinion that many would hold in high regard.\n\nLast, I believe that a daily election blog with critical intent is essential. It allows for students to factor into their calculations events worthy of consideration that the life of a student does not always\u00a0permit them to observe. To objectively (as per a popular suggestion) offer the information that a stunt had taken place without canvassing for student reaction, for example, would be an empty exercise and a violation of this newspaper's short but proud history. As well as the blog, we have produced an election special, radio debates, video debates, and online questions for the presidential candidates. With over 4,000 students following our Facebook page alone and over 100,000 site visitors a month, we have a responsibilty to ask the right questions of people because no one else\u00a0with the same following will.\n\nWe came in for criticism for the objective nature of our candidate profiles. I hope you've enjoyed our two ensuing weeks of critically-based coverage - I sure have.", "Imageurl": "8474", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8452", "Heading": "How to Win Votes and Influence People - Day 10"}
