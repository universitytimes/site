The last decade has seen the start of a new technological revolution that will not only change the way we think about manufacturing, but our relationship with technology itself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Traditionally (if I can use that word here) 3D printers have been used for modelling in both the medical and automotive field. In 2003, Egyptian doctors used 3D printing to create a skull model of two conjoined twins. The model allowed surgeons to examine the vasculature area between their brains and rehearse the operation before successfully separating them. Major car producers have used 3D printing when designing new ranges. The lower investment of both time and money offered by 3D printers is very beneficial during the design process, as it allows for numerous options to be explored almost simultaneously. Although these two areas have seen significant growth over the past decade, there is plenty more to come.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The technology behind these printers is changing rapidly, with an ever-increasing number of materials now being able to be printed. These new materials include glass, plaster, paper and even stainless steel. Such advances have even seen construction companies examine the possibility of using printers as substitutes for manual labour for the construction of such things as the foundation. The quality of the finished goods has also significantly improved, with many aerospace companies are now using them to create and replace specific parts of airplanes. NASA has even looked into the possibility of bringing one into space, which could significantly alter future space missions, which could potentially print any faulty part of their spacecraft. The advance in technology has also seen ever smaller and affordable printers being made, which will change the way we live in our homes.</p>\r\nToday, a printer can cost just over 100$ and can start printing instantly, with sites like thingiverse.com offering over 100,000 free designs to download and print already. They offer designs for everything from glow in the dark Halloween decorations to covers for you iPod. The potential uses are infinite. With the designs of some basic household items, you would never run out of mugs, you&rsquo;d always have an Allaen Key and you&rsquo;d even have your own unique iPhone cover.\r\n\r\n3D printing is definitely here to stay. It is no longer going to be a toy for the ultra rich or a tool for the highly specialised. It&rsquo;s increasing affordability and improved product has seen its use spread in all directions, from the precise needs of aerospace engineers to the likes of you and me. 3D printers will soon become part of our lives the way computers, microwaves and the telephone have already.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/k-bigpic.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23648", "Heading": "Game Changer"}
