{"Body": "<strong>Conor Bates |\u00a0</strong>Sports Editor\r\n\r\nFollowing the announcement of the 2013 GAA All-Star nominations and the 2014 Championship draw, it&rsquo;s safe to say that this GAA season is in the history books. The retirement of the legendary Tomas O&rsquo;S\u00e9 from inter-county football is sure to the final piece of drama, the full-stop at the end of a wondrous GAA year. There is very little else to say, other than to note that this has been one of the best seasons, for both hurling and football, in living memory.\r\n\r\nThe hurling championship was blown wide open when Dublin bested perennial favourites Kilkenny in a replay, before going on to hammer Galway for the Leinster Championship. Limerick beat neighbours Tipperary, setting up a qualifier clash between the Munster side and rivals Kilkenny. With this draw, the Championship would be settled in a game. Whoever won this titanic encounter would surely blitz through the back-door to success, no? The Cats emerged victorious in what was dubbed &ldquo;a hurling apocalypse&rdquo; (no joke), and their journey ultimately finished with a comprehensive defeat at the hands of Cork.\r\n\r\nFor the first time since 2005, Kilkenny or Tipperary wouldn&rsquo;t be lifting the Liam McCarthy trophy in September. The tournament was anyone&rsquo;s, and while more cynical pundits suggested that it was because the standards of the traditional juggernauts had waned, to the majority of onlookers it was very different; a new name on the trophy, because all of the typically &lsquo;fringe&rsquo; counties had raised their games to an unexpected level. If you watched both final games, you would certainly agree.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"578\"]<img id=\"irc_mi\" style=\"margin-top: 31px;\" title=\"Shane O'Donnell\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://img.rasset.ie/0007ec0b-642.jpg\" width=\"578\" height=\"325\" /> Shane O'Donnell scored a hat-trick in the All-Ireland Final replay.[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn drawing 3-16 to 0-25, Cork and Clare set up a second showdown for a second consecutive year. Their tallies of twenty-five points each included a thunderbolt Anthony Nash goal and a last-minute point from Domhnall O&rsquo;Donovan to level matters. Marty Morrissey&rsquo;s howl of &ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo; will echo in many spectators memories for the foreseeable future. A spectacular replay performance from Shane O&rsquo;Donnell, another Nash goal, and some incredible free-flowing hurling saw Clare take the cup home with two goals to spare. The passionate celebrations of Davy FitzGerald tell you all you need to know about the majesty and hard-fought nature of the Clare win. A truly encapsulating season for the national game.\r\n\r\nThe competition with the larger ball was no less impressive. The skill and athleticism required to compete at the top level in the football championship has been increasing exponentially in the last few years. With increased physicality, the game had become manipulated by some of the Ulster contingent to favour them; it wasn&rsquo;t against the rules, it just wasn&rsquo;t particularly enjoyable. This year turned the tide of recent football competitions.\r\n\r\nThe home of negative football, the Ulster Championship, was turned on its head as Monaghan claimed their first title in 25 years. Cavan also bucked the trend of blanket defences and cynical tackling, as is represented with a large contingent in the All-Star nominations. In the Munster footballing strongholds, Cork and Kerry gave a number of performances to remember, with of them meeting their ends at the hands of Dublin. Indeed, the Dublin-Kerry game has been touted as one of the best in history, and it&rsquo;s fair to say that this is in no way a hyperbolic statement; there are very few games that have displayed such panache, flair and blistering pace.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"467\"]<img id=\"irc_mi\" style=\"margin-top: 40px;\" title=\"McCaffrey\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn2.herald.ie/sport/gaa/article29473400.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/SPT_20130805_SFA_066_28484156_I1.JPG\" width=\"467\" height=\"308\" /> Jack McCaffrey (Dublin) was one of the exponents of brilliant football this season.[/caption]\r\n\r\nThis year&rsquo;s runners-up, Mayo, played some of the best football throughout both league and championship campaigns. They were unreserved advocates of the fast-paced, tough football and they were undoubtedly a spark in this year&rsquo;s competition. Throw in the &ldquo;Mayo for Sam&rdquo; media campaign and the hype about ending their long wait for Championship glory, and this year was almost perfect for Aidan O&rsquo;Shea and co. A tricky final and resolute Dubs side was all that separated them from ultimate victory. Make no mistake though, their play was of the highest standard, as was that of the teams in their echelon this year. Suffice to say, Kevin Heffernan would have been proud of Dublin&rsquo;s achievements.\r\n\r\nIn recent times, both hurling and football Championships could be accused of having a certain degree of inevitability, of being bogged down in boring defending, of holding a degree of cynicism and most importantly lacking the intrigue that makes the GAA Championship what it is. It is a part of this sporting-mad-country&rsquo;s culture that drives us, and finally the excitement, finesse, devotion and passion is back with a bang. Here&rsquo;s hoping for more of the same next year.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Nash.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20078", "Heading": "Marquee season draws to a close"}
