The second third of their interning period pays nurses and midwives &euro;6.92 per hour and the final third &euro;7.79 per hour. This amounts to 80 per cent and 90 per cent of the national minimum wage respectively.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Furthermore, the starting salary for nurses and midwives is currently at &euro;23,129 after four years of training. Eighty-five per cent of nurses and midwives will start at this rate of pay in their first year and 90 per cent in their second year.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Speaking at the demonstration, TCD JS Nursing student Grace Murphy criticised the government for calling nursing a &ldquo;vocation&rdquo;, stating that &ldquo;nurses and midwives are professional healthcare providers, just like dentists and physicians&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">She went on to say that nurses are &ldquo;asking to be treated with respect. We&rsquo;re not asking for any special treatment or any undue admiration here&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TCD student Adam Miller also spoke outside Dr Steeven&rsquo;s Hospital highlighting how this low wage is unfair when long shifts and overtime is expected due to staff shortages in hospitals.</p>\r\nUSI are now requesting that Minister James Reilly brings about an increase in pay for the graduate nurse scheme and &ldquo;a conversation to ensure about the increase in student intern pay&rdquo;.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0150.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24683", "Heading": "High Turnout at Student Nurses and Midwives Demonstration"}
