{"Body": "&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Una Kelly</strong> | Online News Editor\n\n&nbsp;\n\nUS Department of Defense Counsel Jeh Johnson was greeted by a silent demonstration staged by DU Amnesty International as he arrived to address DU Law Society on Tuesday last.\n\nJohnson, the chief legal officer of the Department of Defense and legal adviser to the Seceretary of Defense, is regarded as one of the most powerful lawyers in America and was named as one of America&rsquo;s Most Influential Democrat Lawyers in the National Law Journal 2008. In his current role, Johnson negotiates US defence tactics against Al-Qaeda and is a leader in the opposition of the &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rsquo; military policy.\n\nAs he arrived to speak to the Law Society about public service and US national security law he was met in Front Square by members of DU Amnesty, who were dressed in masks and orange jumpsuits, holding candles and placards condemning the human rights violations in Guantanamo Bay. Speaking to <em>The University Times</em>, Amnesty chairperson Maeve Brady outlined the society&rsquo;s reason for the demonstration, &ldquo;The US Department of Defence Counsel Jeh Johnson has drawn criticism from human-rights groups for stating that the administration has a right to detain a suspected terrorist indefinitely if it is determined that he or she is a security threat.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13766\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"447\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/29/du-amnesty-protests-at-us-department-of-defense-counsels-visit/amnesty/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13766\"><img class=\" wp-image-13766     \" title=\"amnesty\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/amnesty3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"296\" /></a> Johnson speaking with DU Amnesty Chair Maeve Brady prior to his address to the Law Society.

All Guantanamo detainees must either be charged or tried in courts that meet international standards for fairness, such as a US federal court, or be released to countries where their human rights will be respected.&rdquo;\n\nJohnson approached the demonstrators and spoke to them before inviting them to take part in a question and answer session following his address in the GMB. He began his speech by saying that he respected the courtesy of the Amnesty members, admired what they are doing and hopes his own children would one day feel as strongly on such important issues.\n\nHe went on to outline his career, starting in the US Attorney&rsquo;s office in New York upon graduation from Colombia Law School, and then becoming a public defender. In November of 2006 he received a call from Barack Obama, who at that time was considered a long shot for the presidency. Johnson became an integral part of Obama&rsquo;s election campaign, canvassing door to door, and in February 2009 was formally appointed General Counsel to the Department of Defense, overseeing 10,000 lawyers.\n<blockquote>We make a living from what we get, we make a life by what we give</blockquote>\nDespite obvious setbacks, he considers the ending of the combat mission in Iraq, the reversal of the Taliban&rsquo;s momentum in Afghanistan and the repeal of the &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rsquo; policy as some of the department&rsquo;s core achievements. &ldquo;In this job there is often no clear and apparent answer,&rdquo; he said. Often he has 45 minutes to decide on approval of a military operation, based on nothing but &ldquo;judgement, common sense, and a strong sense of right and wrong.&rdquo; \u00a0He commented on the nature of working in Washington DC, where often information was leaked to the media before he had even signed documents, and that he sometimes got more of an overview of what was happening in the department from reading the <em>New York Times</em> or the <em>Washington Post. </em>Johnson had just returned from spending Thanksgiving in Afghanistan with American troops, where he said he always encounters moments that both &ldquo;warm your heart and break your heart.&rdquo;\n\nThe first question from the floor came from Amnesty chair Maeve Brady, who brought up the issue of the human rights violation involved in the indefinite detention of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Johnson replied by saying he suspected he would not be able to convince certain members of the audience and he could deliver entire lectures on the topic, but he would try to give a concise answer. He pointed out that during the Bush administration there had been 600-700 prisoners, and under Obama that has dropped to 165. The remaining population are &ldquo;the worst of the worst&rdquo;, and there are several problems in the efforts to release them. First, that the US Congress has placed restrictions which impede their release. Second, that there is enormous difficulty in finding a country which will take them as they are considered so dangerous. And third, that detaining an enemy is as old as the use of armies. The difference here, he said, is that the US is facing an untraditional enemy and non-state actor. It would not do to make up rules for this unprecedented situation, and so the department of defence must apply the conventional principles of warfare.\n\nIn response to a question on what advice he would give to those seeking a way into public service, Johnson said the opportunities often present themselves to those who are interested in it. He commented that he had found his role in public service much more fulfilling than work in a private law firm and recalled a saying from a teacher at his school in Atlanta, Georgia which has stayed with him: &ldquo;We make a living from what we get, we make a life by what we give.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "13766", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13752", "Heading": "DU Amnesty Protests at US Department of Defense Counsel's Visit"}
