In total, 397 current and former Trinity students are said to have signed up as escorts for the website.\r\n\r\nUniversity of Limerick had the most new sign-ups in 2013, with 93 students deciding to seek\u00a0\"wealthy benefactors\" to help them pay the rising student contribution charge last year. Dublin Institute of Technology came second with 81 new sign-ups. This was followed by UCD with 79, and NUIG with 77.\u00a0In order to incentivise university students to join, the website offers free premium membership to students who sign up using their college email addresses.\r\n\r\nThe press release sent out by the website states:\r\n\r\n\"Most undergraduate students attending publicly funded third-level courses in Ireland do not have to pay tuition fees. However, many are still struggling to pay for their education, which includes registration fees that are expected to increase by 20 percent in the next two years. The average Irish Sugar Baby receives &euro;6,200 in monthly allowance and gifts from her Sugar Daddy to pay for expenses, such as housing and transportation.\"\r\n\r\nThe company refers to the \"Sugar Daddy\"-\"Sugar Baby\" relationship as a \"mutually beneficial\" one. In a statement issued to <em>DailyEdge.ie, s</em>pokesperson for the site Angela Jacob Bermudo said: \"It&rsquo;s created to suit the lifestyle of the Sugar Daddy. He says he can only see her one day a week, or only on weekends&hellip;It&rsquo;s all laid out at the start of the relationship.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of the Sugar Daddies actually want to be mentors. They take great satisfaction in moulding these young ladies and preparing them for the real world.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the \"arrangements\" facilitated by the website\u00a0do not necessite sexual intimacy, Bermudo explained that \"If the relationship moves on to a stage where they are comfortable enough to be intimate with each other, then maybe. But it&rsquo;s not required.\"\r\n\r\nSixth on the list of \"Top 10 Fastest Growing Sugar Baby Schools\" was University College Cork with 65 sign-ups in 2013, followed by Waterford Institute of Technology with 62, Dublin City University with 59, Cork Institute of Technology with 53, and Limerick Institute of Technology with 51.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/SeekingArrangement-SugarBaby-4.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23380", "Heading": "Trinity Has Most Irish Student Sign-ups to Escort Service"}
