The candidate was able to launch his Facebook page at last this morning and thus, has ended his hunger strike. He decided to celebrate in bizarre fashion: &ldquo;I actually sent a Dominoes pizza out to Aung San Suu Kyi who&rsquo;s on house arrest. I don&rsquo;t know if she got the pizza yet though&rdquo; he said of the Burmese politician who was in fact released from house arrest in 2010. Sorry Tom, thank you Wikipedia. Lenihan claims to have had a good day in D&rsquo;Olier St nursing school, &ldquo;playing a bit of golf and shooting the breeze with the nurses&rdquo;. He spoke with them about the &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; nursing initiative proposed by the government and pledged to support any protests made by the nurses against it. Lenihan has moved on from yesterday's national press coverage of his campaign despite fresh attempts made by the <em>Irish Sun</em> to cover it. \"A lot of it I see as a handicap personally and there's a lot of abuse there.\" Much of the candidate's focus for the day was on the Hamilton, covering issues such as a common room and internships.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Lylas Aljohmani also claims to have had a good day's campaigning. \"We've been able to get a bit of a buzz going; we're on stunt No. 3! We have a big balloon version of me and a lot of people are engaging with it. It's a bit of a gimmick really, just to get people talking.\" The stunt hints, however, at something that would interest Aljohmani as President: \"If there's a campaign, I'd like to have a mascot to represent it - for RAG Week of SHAG Week or whatever it is.\" The candidate spent time in Halls last night, knocking on doors and is pleased with the \"positive vibe\" she felt. She used it as an opportunity to explain her plans for different housing strategies, and clarify \"what [she] means by internships and how she would go about making Off-Campus hours more effective\". Sensing that election fatigue is setting in for students, Aljohmani is planning to release a campaign video advising students how to avoid campaigns. Should it prove too successful, Aljohmani may have to think of new ways to trap students in idle chit chat about student politics.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">It was an early start today for the Hamilton-based, Rosa Langhammer. \"I was up early this morning to campaign in the BESS Ball queue and then we went out to St. James's (School of Medicine).\" Langhammer also ran a stunt today, erecting a large board, painted with an image of the candidate with a gap for students to put their faces through. \"It's to represent that the SU is more approachable, that everyone can have their input and their ideas come to the fore.\" Langhammer believes that frustration from students with campaigning is down to the large number of candidates running: \"Every time I feel people are getting kind of annoyed, I go to D'Olier St - or I went to James's today.\" Over the course of her campaigning, meanwhile, Langhammer has noticed differences between students at opposite ends of campus: \"Hamilton people are generally busier while Arts Block people are generally happy to hang around.\" She has been pushing her proposed mobile phone app. and promised off-campus deals today, believing that off-campus students have been \"ignored for too long.\" Langhammer's plans to get to as many science and medicine lectures tomorrow because \"Arts Blcok kids don't come in on Fridays.\"</span>\n<em>By Fionn O'Dea</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Communications</strong></h3>\nAs the week wears on and momentum becomes an issue, we usually see a significant shift from leaflets to conversation as the medium for electioneering. Our Communications candidates should know this better than anyone, and the movement to greater interactivity and lecture speeches is usually greeted with positivity. In the Arts Block at least, the sizeable BESS Ball queue gave candidates plenty of opportunity to communicate with the student body.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">In keeping with the shift away from pamphlets, the four hopefuls spent a large proportion of the day engaging in lecture addresses. As <strong>Ricky McCormack</strong>, (apologies for misspelling the name yesterday. Third time&rsquo;s the charm!) has been focussing the majority of his campaign on the aforementioned addresses he is no stranger to them at this stage. McCormack has used his speeches to spearhead his promise of greater inclusivity and bridging the SU-student gap. As campaign manager, Lydia Rahill told us yesterday, &ldquo;communication isn&rsquo;t just buzzwords. Ricky is really trying to push the idea of inclusivity in the SU, and get back to a position that is similar to the role before the UT editorship became an issue.&rdquo; To this effect, McCormack visited both D&rsquo;Olier Street and St. James&rsquo; today. McCormack also regretted that poor weather conditions stymied an outdoor stunt, and hopes that tomorrow will bring better conditions.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Leanna Byrne</strong> braved the freezing cold Hamilton in order to address students. In her speeches, she emphasised her relative experience in both the University Times and the SU. In terms of her promises, she again reiterated her &lsquo;5 point plan&rsquo; for invigorating the SU and UT, with a particular attention paid to her prototype UT app, encouraging people to enquire about the prototype from her campaign team. She &ldquo;was speaking to lots of people in the Arts block this morning, and they all seem to be reacting well. Getting out and talking to people is really important after a few days. Everyone&rsquo;s tired but they prefer when we talk to them.&rdquo; She carried her campaign into the evening in the Hamilton, conversing with Trinity's science students. Byrne added another video to her repertoire this afternoon which further outlines her policies.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Tommy Gavin</strong> joined Byrne in basing himself in the Hamilton, and chose his addresses to expand on some of his policies, in particular his most recent addition, a web forum for student-SU interaction. He stresses that this would be free to implement and free to use. &ldquo;Basically, I will set up an SU online forum using the free open-source code that reddit.com uses, which will provide a space for students to interact with each other, and with the SU. The disconnect between students and the SU stems from that the fact that SU communications are top down, we are expected to listen. Because the reddit model has an 'upvote' and 'downvote' function for posts, it would mean that if a post that was critical of the SU got a lot of upvotes; the SU would be forced to take notice, and if an SU post got a lot of downvotes, it would be forced to reconsider.&rdquo; Gavin also reaffirmed his commitment to sweeping change in the form of <em>The University Times</em>, taking it from its current format to a digital-first newsroom, and a bi-monthly glossy paper. After being prompted to back up his assertions on this matter, he has cited the success of student newspapers,\u00a0<em>The Daily Emerald\u00a0</em>in Oregon and\u00a0<em>The Cavalier\u00a0</em>in the University of Virginia, as newspapers who have switched to this format.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After the release of his campaign video last night, <strong>Matt Taylor</strong> was camped in the Arts Block for the majority of the day. His main message in his speeches was to address &ldquo;the failure of the SU to deliver information to students. The information is there, it&rsquo;s just buried in an office or on a website that no one views.&rdquo; Taylor has promised to improve this situation by encouraging more interaction with class reps, and fostering an element of \"personal interaction and community development.\" He also noted that in his discourse with students on campus, <em>The University Times</em> was their key interest. Taylor has suggested the implementation of an editorial board &ldquo;to create a collective team effort and more structured content intake and output, as well as better curated content. People seem enthusiastic about this.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">As the week draws toward a close, and we are more aware than ever of the campaign issues and the candidates&rsquo; promises, there is one interesting stat that conveys the positivity in this race. In a week that is littered with EC penalties, communications is the only contested race that has, of yet, seen no candidate receive any sanctions from the EC.</span>\n<em>By Conor Bates</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Education</h3>\n<strong>Eric Tebay</strong> started his day at James Hospital, meeting with students and giving a lecture address. In his address, he &ldquo;highlighted how I wouldn't be forgetting the off-campus students if I was elected.&rdquo; Tebay explained that many of the points in his manifesto apply to John Stearne students, such as the transparency policy, extended library hours, and changes in the module assessment system. &ldquo;When I centralise the assessment of modules, there'll be an option to assess their clinical placement. This would allow Health Science students to red flag any problems and alert college.&rdquo; Tonight he will continue going through Halls and talking to students there about some of his policies that will benefit first-years. &ldquo;The response has been largely positive out there and I'd like Halls people to know that as part of my &lsquo;You&rsquo; policy, I'll be running Education clinics out there next year. Any student can drop into me any evening that I'm out there and we can have a chat about their course and come up with a solution to any problems they have.&rdquo;\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Tebay is not the only candidate campaigning heavily with first-year students. Last night <strong>John Curtin</strong> went door to door in Halls to speak to students about his campaign. He also believes his campaign team&rsquo;s presence in the arts block has drawn the interest of some first-year students. &ldquo;It has been very encouraging to see first year students approaching me, asking to be on my campaign team because they really believe in the policies that I am promoting.&rdquo; His campaign team&rsquo;s presence has also allowed Curtin and his team to gage student interest in one of the points in his manifesto, the introduction of December exams into the College system. &ldquo;While [my campaign manager] Aoife and I and my campaign team have been on the ground, it seems that people have seen it as a very positive step, because Christmas exams alleviate a lot of pressure. It&rsquo;s something that other colleges have and something that definitely needs to be discussed.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Reaching the end of the week, <strong>Jack Leahy&rsquo;s</strong> campaign is slowing things down a bit. &ldquo;Thursday and Friday are more relaxed days. People are less interested in being handed manifestos&hellip;it&rsquo;s more about talking to students, hearing why they&rsquo;re voting for you, what&rsquo;s appealed to them and what&rsquo;s not appealed to them&hellip;really fleshing out your own policies but in a way that isn&rsquo;t quite as tense and serious as the first few days.&rdquo; Leahy shares the same policy as Tebay in regards to extending library hours, specifically the John Stearne library. Leahy pointed out that although that library has long hours during the week, not all students can take advantage of that study time.\u00a0\u00a0&ldquo;[Medical sciences] students can be on placement as far away as Donnegal&hellip;they don&rsquo;t get time to use the library during the week, and the library hours are very poor at the weekend.&rdquo; He plans to achieve this by looking at which weekdays are busiest and which are slower, in the hopes that hours can be shorter on one weekday in order to extend them during the weekend.</span>\n<em>By Becky Prager</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ents</h3>\nAfter the excitement of yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trinity Ball tix&rdquo; going on sale, the Arts Block was slightly less hectic today as <strong>Cameron Macauley</strong> redirected his campaign \u00a0to D.I.T and D.C.U, some &ldquo;of the &lsquo;swing&rsquo; colleges&rdquo; of the elections. Campaign manager Paul Testar told The University Times, &ldquo;DIT were rapturous in their support of Cameron's policies and we expect a library closure movement to take off across the country, despite Trinity Library's callous and cowardly U-Turn on their closure policy yesterday morning.&rdquo; Coinciding with this move, Cameron released his fourth campaign video aimed to pull in the votes of Arts students with a unique twist on his usual slogan, &ldquo;The Party CANNOT Stop&hellip; Even for Feelings.&rdquo; The black and white film which features Cameron chilling in the Smoking Area shows his awareness of the daily schedule of an Arts student which includes &ldquo;Read Ulysses, Smoke, Smoke Drugs [and] Start My First Novel.&rdquo; When quizzed yesterday on the performance of Ents this year, Cameron stated &ldquo;To be honest I think it&rsquo;s unfair on poor Glen Whelan. It&rsquo;s hard being an international soccer superstar and running the Trinity Student&rsquo;s Union Ents Office at the same time. That takes a serious physical toll on your body.&rdquo;\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Elsewhere in the campaign, <strong>Conor Shmeesh Gleeson</strong> made an appearance in the Arts Block today following his recovery from loss of voice as he set up his &ldquo;Shmeesh for Ents&rdquo; stand. The team took this opportunity to meet with fans and make several lecture addresses throughout the day. Last night Shmeesh made the &ldquo;trek&rdquo; to Trinity Hall with a team of 30 Shmeeshes to build some &ldquo;shmype&rdquo; around the first year accommodation. Shmeesh will be announcing his plans tomorrow for a more serious manifesto as he looks set to contest the Ents race as a serious candidate.</span>\n<strong>Sean Reynolds</strong> became the last Ents candidate to upload his promotional video last night, which emphasized the message of his manifesto and highlighted his experience. The video has amassed an impressive 2000+ views since last night. However, the sands are shifting beneath each Ents candidate as we near the opening of the polls on Monday. Reynolds spent his day canvassing students in St James&rsquo; Hospital but most of today&rsquo;s electoral drama has been fueled by Conor &lsquo;Shmeesh&rsquo; Gleeson&rsquo;s intention to launch &lsquo;the serious side of [his] campaign&rsquo; tomorrow. Reynolds has been particularly vocal in his criticism of Shmeesh&rsquo;s tactics, telling <em>The University Times</em> he feels it is \"unfair that he [Shmeesh] has gone through the week without any scrutiny of his experience&rsquo; and accusing Shmeesh of thus far depriving students of &lsquo;the chance to decide on the best candidate without the joke tactics and gimmickry.\"\n\n<strong>Cian Mulville</strong> had less to say on the matter of Shmeesh&rsquo;s U-turn, declining to comment, instead choosing to gain momentum through suspense-building promotion on the Mulville for Ents Facebook page. In the afternoon Mulville uploaded a picture of him receiving his Rag Week tattoo, promising a picture of the tattoo upon receipt of 100 Facebook Likes. Despite surpassing 100 likes only a few hours later, Mulville chose to hold off (picture of tattoo remains un-uploaded as of 19:49). Mulville hopes such attempts to increase intensity and excitement for his campaign will see him fare better in today&rsquo;s <em>University Times</em> polls (to be released tomorrow) where he will hope to haul himself from behind his three competitors.\n\n<em>By Shauna Cleary &amp; Carl Kinsella</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Welfare</h3>\nOn the campaign trail today, I asked Garry if he had to pick, what would be his main campaign next year if he got elected?He responded by saying that rather than one particular approach, he is going to &lsquo;strive for a holistic approach to well-being, focusing on mental health, physical health, and practical concerns such as financial and accommodation issues. This approach is incorporated in the three campaign areas of Campaigns, Collaboration and Support. \"I'll be taking innovative approaches to mental health by introducing initiatives such as Mental Health Through the Arts. My Cycle to College scheme and Gym Buddy system are aimed at promoting a cheaper, faster, healthier way to get to college and getting non-exercisers exercising. I'll also be focusing on making the hunt for accommodation a little bit easier, introducing motivational workshops, and fundraising for the student hardship fund. I want to empower members of the college community to be able to offer support to those around them and seek support when necessary.\"\n\nUnfortunately it was not a specific answer and this had me thinking, is Garry being too ambitious and by not having at least one core campaign, does he run the risk of spreading his campaigning strategy too thinly?\n\n<em>By Rebecca O'Keeffe</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "14842", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/trinity-elects33", "ID": "14841", "Heading": "Trinity Elects: Day Four"}
