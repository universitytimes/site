But it wasn&rsquo;t the comparative text question or ecology that had pushed him over the edge &ndash; &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t understand the stuff written on the bathroom walls then there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll ever get in to university&rsquo; &ndash;<em> Jane Doe is easy as 3.14. </em>- He didn&rsquo;t.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it but in a recent study I have found that cubicle doors are no longer the forums for honest expression that they once appeared to be. Of course, my findings are naturally limited to fifty-percent of the facilities on campus, a cruel measure of commitment to investigative journalism positioning me somewhat to the left of Anderson Cooper. However, let it be clarified now that I am in no way condoning the defacement of college property, the clean walls are a fantastic reflection &ndash; of our evolution, our commitment to the community, our respect for authority. There is also a possibility that the UV drug lighting has made it too difficult to read in there.\n\nSo where have all of the anonymous, oftentimes cruel, most times hilarious tidbits gone, I hear you cry?\u00a0The comment boxes of the Internet &ndash; the toilet walls and cubicle doors of the modern age.\n\nWhen asked recently how she feels about reading her own press, &lsquo;Location, Location, Location&rsquo; vamp Kirstie Allsopp replied &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think everyone who reads the Daily Mail is a nutter, but the people who leave comments underneath definitely are&rsquo; &ndash; A thought that has obviously crossed the minds of the DM legal team, considering the banner at the bottom of the hugely popular webpage branded in bold with the words &lsquo;the views expressed in the content above are those of our readers and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.&rsquo; Nice save.\n\nScanning through a few examples, in various publications, helps to illustrate the true extent to which the college bubble is a microcosm of &lsquo;real life&rsquo;. Grown up versions of every faculty have found their new loo. To begin with the above-mentioned journal we find the arts block. A mass audience, dealing with information, which is not particularly life changing or even relatively transferable, but definitely the most amusing. For example, in response to the story <em>Rumours that the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant after she refuses to eat peanut paste during royal event</em> one commentator exclaims &lsquo;Oh my god! I refused to eat peanut butter the other day, does that mean I&rsquo;m pregnant too?&rsquo;\n\nThe next rung on the ladder, although in reality, quite a large jump &ndash; <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em>. Addressing topics of somewhat greater urgency such as war, famine and human rights violations gives rise to the striking difference that comments are paragraphed. An article detailing the Italian government&rsquo;s recent agreement to IMF monitoring in order to avoid falling even further into economic crisis resulted in the prescription\n\n&lsquo;Just close the border east of Nice and let Italy fall away festering at itself. They&rsquo;ll probably still have the money to field a soccer team so for the rest of it who cares?&rsquo; Gary, Virginia.\n\nWow, probably a little bit of an overly aggressive response Gary, Virginia. Would I be completely off the mark in guessing you are a lawyer by profession?\n\n<em>The Economist</em> boasts much the same variety of rebuttal. However, instead of <strong>rooneyfan </strong>or <strong>chunkylover365</strong> our BESS friends are operating under the alter ego <strong>hedgefundguy</strong>, a screen name which puts paid to the claim that investment banks are looking to recruit graduates with a broad variety of interests.\n\nTo sum up with a catch-all sentence for everyone else: doctors are too busy, engineering is a numbers game and anybody with a computer science degree knows where to find better stuff than newspapers on the internet.\u00a0 In a world of political correctness and Facebook status anxiety, anonymous comments mean that to some extent free speech lives on, mostly to the advantage of cyber-bullies and the criminally insane, but it does on the rare occasion make for a good read through an arguably less intrusive medium than times gone by.", "Imageurl": "6500", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6499", "Heading": "Toilet Door Commentators Have New Forum Online"}
