The Labour Presidential nominee, Michael D Higgins, seconded the motion.\n\nNawi was facing charges of assaulting soldiers after the soldiers had broken up a peaceful protest he was staging on behalf of the Palestinian cause. Senator Norris claimed that the charges against him were false and that the judge at trial had taken the evidence of the soldiers over the evidence of Nawi. It seems there were no eye-witnesses to Nawi's alleged assault on the soldiers.\n\nMichael D Higgins seconded the motion and seems to have supported the work of Nawi in Palestine. The result of the motion was that a letter be written to the Minister for Justice and the Israeli Ambassador, expressing concern over Nawi's arrest.\n\nThis information comes as Senator Norris's campaign is collapsing due to a letter he wrote on Nawi's behalf in 1997, seeking to influence a criminal trial, albeit on very different charges.\n\n<em>The University Times</em> has spoken to Higgins and he has stated that he had absolutely no knowledge of Mr Nawi's conviction at the time he seconded the motion.\n\nAdditional reporting from Donncha Conway", "Imageurl": "3407", "Thumb_nail": "http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/david-norris", "ID": "18226", "Heading": "Oireachtas Committee passed motion in support of Norris&#039;s ex-partner, Higgins seconded "}
