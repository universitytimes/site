{"Body": "Fionn Fitzpatrick-\n\nUpon recently being introduced to software called PaulStrech, that can slow\u00a0any piece of music\u00a0down by 1000% while still maintaining quality production (making Rebecca Black&rsquo;s &lsquo;Friday&rsquo; sound like a lost track from Kid A), I stumbled upon a 58 minute epic of the<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84kCqAJKZ1w\"><em> Jurassic Park</em> theme</a>. Sceptically putting on the headphones, I was amazed at how instantly the brooding, cosmic soundscape connected with me. It was like I had heard it a million times before, which of course I had. The familiarity of the<em> Jurassic Park</em> theme is a treasured thing for me. It simply sounds like nostalgia; sitting a foot from the television at 5 years old as Sam Neill gazed wisely out the plane window at a flock of pelicans, pondering the brilliance of evolution (when really he should have been in a straitjacket rocking furiously back and forth, suffering horribly from post-traumatic stress).\n\n<em>Jurassic Park</em> is one of maybe two films that I feel uniquely belong to me. When I was young, it was challenged only by Tim Burton&rsquo;s<em> Batman</em>. My memories of watching these two masterpieces of cinema from aged 4 or 5 are quite hazy. After all, at that age you only watch TV for the pretty colours. Movies are just slightly more complicated pictures. However, whenever I hear the main theme from <em>Jurassic Park</em> or <em>Batman</em>, from John Williams and Danny Elfman respectfully, I remember how much I enjoyed those sounds as a child. It&rsquo;s probably why at 19 I dig for fossils in the day and fight crime at night. But I&rsquo;ve said too much.\n\nGreat directors know the value of a great film score. Woody Allen&rsquo;s <em>Manhattan</em> is remembered as much for its Gershwin soundtrack as it is its <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5owXCZ0CDg\">&ldquo;Why is life worth living?&rdquo; scene</a>. Think of Speilberg&rsquo;s classics alongside<em> Jurassic Park</em>; <em>E.T, Indiana Jones, Shindler&rsquo;s List, Catch Me If You Can</em>. All of them have instantly recognisable scores that drop the audience into those worlds. Listen to the <em>Catch Me If You Can</em> theme as you&rsquo;re walking to college in the morning and you&rsquo;ll instantly start to feel stealthy; the <em>Gladiator</em> theme and you would fist-fight a tiger. This is what great film scores can do. They allow us escape from ourselves and live a different life, if only for a few minutes (a few more with help from PaulStretch).\u00a0\n\nFeel free to post your favourite film scores below!\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/gaLDyrun_Cc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n", "Imageurl": "2718", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2715", "Heading": "The sound of nostalgia;  classic film scores"}
