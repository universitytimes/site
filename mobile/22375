{"Body": "<strong>Emma McDonnell</strong> | Staff Writer\r\n\r\nThe Trinity Orchestra is holding its annual Michaelmas Term concert next Tuesday evening, 3rd December at 8pm in Christchurch Cathedral. The orchestra&rsquo;s first major classical concert of the year is being hosted in collaboration with the Trinity Fringe Festival, a week-long event combining an eclectic mix of comedy, drama and music. The line-up includes the orchestra&rsquo;s exclusive debut performance using the organ in Christchurch, an exciting and prestigious development. The concert&rsquo;s soloist is esteemed pianist, Mair\u00e9ad Lochrie, a student at the Royal Irish Academy of Music.\r\nIreland&rsquo;s only fully student run orchestra are &ldquo;dedicated&rdquo;, according to conductor, Eoghan Cooke. Having being awarded Trinity&rsquo;s Best Overall Society four times and having represented the college twice at a national level, dedicated is an understatement. Modest too, no doubt. This talented crew of nearly 100 musicians meet every Tuesday evening, and have been practising for this concert since term began. Members are actively encouraged to submit their own compositions for performance. Cooke, a Music graduate from DIT, extolls the virtues of the orchestra&rsquo;s versatility. Its performances range from classical, chamber, string and wind quartets to merging with the contemporary. Most renowned for its covers of Daft Punk, Pink Floyd and Radiohead, it has featured at festivals including Forbidden Fruit and Electric Picnic. The orchestra&rsquo;s popularity is exponentially increasing as they were also a highlight at the 2012 and 2013 Trinity Ball.\r\n\r\nNext week&rsquo;s rousing repertoire features Schubert&rsquo;s Rosamunde Overture, Chopin&rsquo;s Piano Concerto No. 2 and the infamous Saint-Sa\u00ebns &lsquo;Organ Symphony&rsquo;. For the musical novices among you, Cooke informed me that the latter-mentioned &ldquo;spectacular symphony&rdquo; is fondly remembered for being the theme tune in family film Babe, the 1995 classic tale of an orphaned piglet&rsquo;s journey to realisation. Count me in. Set to be a spectacular evening of festivity and flair, tickets are currently available from the Orchestra stand in the Arts Block. Prices are &euro;3, &euro;5 or &euro;10 depending on whether you&rsquo;re a member, student or regular adult. Doors open at 7.30pm and performance begins at 8pm.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/HT13_1.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22375", "Heading": "Trinity Orchestra prepare for the year ahead"}
