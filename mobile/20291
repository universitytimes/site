{"Body": "<strong>What is Fourth Week?</strong>\r\n\r\nFourth Week is &lsquo;Societies Week,&rsquo; going along with Trinity&rsquo;s love of naming weeks (&lsquo;Green Week,&rsquo; &lsquo;Equality and Diversity Week,&rsquo; etc.). Its primary purpose is to get people involved in societies that they wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be involved in at this point, for example for those who missed signing up for certain societies in Freshers&rsquo; Week. To facilitate this, the Central Societies Committee (CSC) have provided special Fourth Week grants to society committees to hold free &lsquo;taster&rsquo; events during the week for students to come and check them out without having to pay the full membership fee. According to D\u00f3nal McKeating, Chair of the CSC, &ldquo;Fourth Week is the dedicated week for all of Trinity's Societies. It gives them a fantastic opportunity to showcase the best of what they can do without having to worry about any financial constraints.&rdquo;\r\n\r\n<strong>What&rsquo;s in it for me?</strong>\r\n\r\nFree stuff. Free events, free wine, free fun. Societies tend to go all out with their events in Fourth Week as they&rsquo;re given extra money from the CSC to do so, so it&rsquo;s the perfect opportunity to start going to society events. There are also lots of weird things on like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/432247656884967/?ref=22\">aerial acrobatics</a> training from the Juggling Society and a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/580096002038304/?ref=22\">falconry exhibit</a> from DU Zoo Soc, which you would arguably never otherwise have the chance to do.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"DU Scandinavian Society\" src=\"https://scontent-a-lhr.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/389820_442698015782892_168338192_n.jpg\" />\n<strong>What&rsquo;s on?</strong>\r\n\r\nLots of things. The central event of the week is the Refreshers Society Signup on Tuesday from 12-3 in The Atrium, which is basically a rerun of Freshers&rsquo; Week (which seems scarily recently) as societies will be back with their stands to sign up new members again. Along with this is numerous society events, some highlights of which are:\r\n\r\n&bull; Theo&rsquo;s talk entitled <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/651736684870794/?ref=2&amp;ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming\">&ldquo;A Theologian&rsquo;s Survival Guide: Tips and Tricks&rdquo;</a> (<em>Monday, 7pm, GMB</em>).
