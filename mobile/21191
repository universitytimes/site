{"Body": "<strong>Ludo Dawnay</strong> | Features Editor\r\n\r\nThe music videos, the views for which have garnered over six figures, depict a bubbly character exuding Mika-like enthusiasm. The choruses quote chat up lines and boast of power. But Eli Kaldwell&rsquo;s faint knocks on the Trinity FM studio door could not be heard for several minutes. His unexpectedly reserved nature, which acquaintances and ex-schoolmates assured me was \"not the true Eli\", continued as he nervously questioned the reason for the meeting, &ldquo;What is this? What is it for?&rdquo;\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/x4ogQrKHOuo\r\n\r\nThe apprehensiveness could be due to some of the negative online reaction to his songs. Many dubbed him the Irish Rebecca Black. The track <em>Rule This City</em> reached the top spot of the cringe subreddit. When asked about this, the Trinity student retorted: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s so cringey. I haven&rsquo;t done anything cringey. I guess that&rsquo;s just me personally.&rdquo; He labels his music &lsquo;Pop&lsquo;n&rsquo;B&rsquo;; influences are Stevie Wonder, the Eurythmics, and Prince. The on-camera persona emerged when talking about his philosophy: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much bad in the world to dwell on that stuff. I want to make people happy. I love fantasy, the thought of delirious contentment. They say it&rsquo;s art. Life&rsquo;s better when you&rsquo;re smiling.&rdquo;\r\n<blockquote>\" a very lovely derriere\"</blockquote>\r\nThe internet has allowed him to be listened to internationally. Many of his fans are from the UK and the US. However, a great array of the YouTube comments have been racist or homophobic. Among them are death threats and calls for his suicide. The second-year Drama and Theatre Studies student &ldquo;kinda just deal[s] with it. It doesn&rsquo;t affect me for some reason&rdquo;. The interviewee insists that people have &ldquo;reacted quite strongly&rdquo; to his music, which is selling on iTunes. He has been recognised and asked for photos.&ldquo;I want to write lyrics that people can relate to,&rdquo; Kaldwell said. Inspiration for <em>Skinny Jeans</em> came from a female friend with \"a very lovely derriere\". Behind them is a desire to be accepted (&lsquo;Donate money to every cause I see / &lsquo;cause those lost people will remind me of me.&rsquo;) The songs talk of a future of silencing past haters, popularity and fame.\r\n\r\nA film student suggested that more locations than one should be used for the music video of a song called <em>Rule This City</em>\u00a0(<em>Rule Harcourt</em> has less of a ring to it, I guess.) During the end of that video, there is a seemingly out of place single frame shot of a ginger girl. I had to ask why. Kaldwell smiled, &ldquo;Ginger girl is the camera girl. Good chick, I&rsquo;ve known her for a long time. We paused, as we shoot for two hours maximum. I grabbed the camera myself and she was on the phone. People love the tiny little details; even a smile.&rdquo;\r\n<blockquote>I wanted to question the seriousness of his music, but I felt I had been given the answer. I wanted to ask about the use of autotune, but I felt I already knew.</blockquote>\r\nHe has never considered appearing on a talent show (&ldquo;I want to achieve my goals the old fashion way, like all the greats.&rdquo;) and writes new music every day on the piano. I wanted to question the seriousness of his music, but I felt I had been given the answer. I wanted to ask about the use of autotune, but I felt I already knew. When the lens focused, Kaldwell relaxed and struck a pose (the hoodie&rsquo;s from American Apparel, if you&rsquo;re wondering). The videos may disagree with its audience, but the musician is most comfortable and confident when in front of camera.\r\n\r\n<em>Eli Kaldwell&rsquo;s EP Glitter Hug is out on November 7th. </em>", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013-10-24-17.16.27.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21191", "Heading": "Eli Kaldwell: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s so cringey &hellip; I want to make people happy&rdquo;"}
