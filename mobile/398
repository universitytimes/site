{"Body": "<p>This year&rsquo;s class reptraining weekend took place at the Carlton Hotel in North Dublin on the 17th and 18th of October last.</p>\n<p>The training took the form of a series of lectures and interactive exercises which aimed to inform the incoming reps regarding representing their classes to college authorities and organising social activities for them. It was a chance for the reps to familiarise themselves with the work of the Students&rsquo; Union at large and the role they play in it and introduce themselves to each other so they could work together over the coming year.</p>\n<p>By these standards, the weekend was considered successful by most who were involved. The reps certainly got to know each other with much interaction and socialising taking place and a friendly atmosphere pervading in the hotel. In casual conversation during the weekend most reps asked about the training also said they felt they were learning a lot and that the weekend was valuable in this respect.</p>\n<p>Ashley Cooke, Education Officer, had this to say: &ldquo;class rep training is intended to fully equip SU reps with the skills they need to carry out their job. It is also great for developing cohesion between the reps so that the union can be as efficient as possible throughout the year. We are delighted about how the training went and all reports I have received from class reps have been overwhelmingly positive.&rdquo;<br />As well as lunch and dinner, the reps were treated to lectures from speakers both inside and outside the Students&rsquo; Union which formed the larger part of the training. Each of the Union&rsquo;s Sabbatical Officers spoke, Cormac Cashman&rsquo;s delightfully succinct lecture on welfare being a particular highlight. President C&oacute;n&aacute;n &Oacute; Broin emphasised the important role of the class reps within the wider Union and highlighted the lobbying power of the SU, particularly in regard to fees.</p>\n<p>The external speakers included Collie McGivern, a negotiator who was involved in the Northern Ireland Peace Process and Ronan Hodson, President of the Graduate Students&rsquo; Union, whose informative and humorous speech on student representation was well received, offering as it did an invaluable insight into how decisions are made in Trinity.</p>\n<p>However naturally the weekend involved much socialising, which unfortunately led to damages being done. Many attendees were seen to be intoxicated on the night of Saturday the 18th leading certain people to unnecessarily discharge six fire extinguishers. They then proceeded to spray anyone or anything which crossed their path. A particular section of the wallpaper on the 2nd floor was thus destroyed. The total cost of this fire extinguisher incident is thought to be in the region of &euro;300.</p>\n<p>The most serious incident however involved a table being thrown off a balcony. There were rumours that the table actually smashed through a car window, bu these were proven to be completely unsubstainsiated. It is not yet certain how this incident came to pass, or who the perpetrators were, yet rumours are rife amongst the student body. Regarding the damages, Ashley Cooke said:<br />&ldquo;Having brought over 200 students away for an overnight training session we felt the event went particularly well. As with any large group you will always get one or two who &lsquo;act up&rsquo; and there were some small incidences involving fire extinguishers. No significant damage was done and the hotel have stated that they will be delighted to have us back again.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The total cost of the weekend came to &euro;14,760 for all 246 class reps. Damages are thought to be in the region of &euro;1,500, however this figure has yet to be finalised.</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>This year&rsquo;s class reptraining weekend took place at the Carlton Hotel in North Dublin on the 17th and 18th of October last.</p>\n<p>The training took the form of a series of lectures and interactive exercises which aimed to inform the incoming reps regarding representing their classes to college authorities and organising social activities for them.
