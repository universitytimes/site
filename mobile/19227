{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">For the first time in four years, Trinity has improved its position in the QS World University Rankings (published yesterday), climbing six places to take the 61st spot. This improved rank comes despite recent austerity cuts made in the higher education sector in Ireland.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0As the only Irish representative in the top 100, Trinity's ranking was boosted by its reputation for research and teaching quality and has also improved under criteria such as staff/student ratios and graduate employability. The announcement consolidates Trinity's position globally as Ireland's highest-ranked higher education institution.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Commenting on the rankings, Provost Patrick Prendergast urged the government to co-invest with the university to secure Ireland's future both economically and socially.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Trinity, now in our fifth century of intellectual endeavour, is a research-led university, generating cutting-edge outputs whose extraordinary national and international impact is acknowledged by these latest rankings. This year&rsquo;s score for our research is our highest ever. Our campus companies and technology transfers emerge from the research we conduct. Trinity now accounts for one-fifth of all spin-out companies from Irish higher education institutions, helping to turn Ireland into an innovation-intensive, high-productivity economy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>&ldquo;Trinity is at the heart of the national push to attract talent to Ireland, nurture existing talent, and turn good ideas into sustainable jobs.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, while Trinity has managed to reverse three years of decline, along with NUIG, most other Irish universities have continued a downward slide, mainly blamed on third-level cutbacks. The seven Irish universities and Dublin IT have all stayed in the top 4% of the world's universities, but UCD has dropped eight places to 131st place, DCU has fallen by over 20 places to share 324th spot and NUI Maynooth has dropped from the 501-550 bracket to between 551-600.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Universities work best when Government works together with them in the economic and social advance of a country,&rdquo; Dr Prendergast stated. &ldquo;This mutually enabling partnership is in danger of failing if fewer public resources are invested in the system and the brake on recruitment, through the Employment Control Framework, is allowed to persist.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The QS rankings are one of a number of international league tables comparing the performance of third-level colleges globally under various headings. In QS, 40pc is allocated to academic reputation, with 20pc each for staff-student ratio and the frequency of the citing of college research in academic research. Employers' reputations account for 10pc, while the remaining 10pc is for internationalisation.\u00a0The results involved responses from 62,094 academics and 27,957 employers internationally, making QS the largest survey of its kind.</p>\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/westfront2.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19227", "Heading": "Trinity Achieves Highest World University Ranking in Four Years"}
