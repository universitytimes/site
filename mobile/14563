Basically, it&rsquo;s chicken fillets, mozzarella and ratatouille, baked until it oozes. It&rsquo;ll take about an hour from start to finish but involves nothing too taxing. Most vegetarians are probably already familiar with the economical delights of ratatouille, and know that it can be eaten with a baked potato or chips or cold for lunch &ndash; but maybe that&rsquo;s just me. All you need is a frying pan, an ovenproof dish, tin foil and some crusty bread.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">This one is dedicated to a friend - you know who you are - who, and I quote, &ldquo;would eat mozzarella off the walls.&rdquo; \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/01/28/kerrys-kitchen-chicken-parmigiana/baked-chicken-parmesan/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14564\">\n</a>\n<strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong>\n<em>\u00a0</em><em style=\"font-size: 13px;\">4 Chicken breasts (or one per person)</em>\n<em>Plain flour &ndash; seasoned and mixed with grated Parmesan</em>\n<em>1 beaten egg</em>\n<em>1 ball of mozzarella</em>\n<em>2 onions</em>\n<em>2/3 courgettes</em>\n<em>2/3 cloves of garlic</em>\n<em>Tin of chopped tomatoes</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Method</strong>\n\n1) Pre-heat the oven to 180\u00b0C.
