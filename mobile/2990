{"Body": "For my two loyal readers (my Ma and Trinity Cat), my apologies that I have been quiet on the blogging front of late. Exams don&rsquo;t leave much time for blogging.\n\nIn this brief blogging sojourn away from study, I had intended to write about what I regard as the daft proposals to reduce the size of the D\u00e1il. However, that will wait for another day, as the news of Garret Fitzgerald&rsquo;s serious illness makes such matters seem trivial.\n\nI won&rsquo;t pretend to know Dr. Fitzgerald well, but I did have the opportunity to brief him when I was working on the first Lisbon Treaty campaign - of course, he knew more about the Treaty than I did and he ended up briefing me! I also did some canvassing with him during that campaign and I have never seen such genuine warmth and affection shown towards someone by the electorate on a campaign trail. If he could have met every voter personally we would have won that referendum by a landslide.\n\nHis commitment to public service and public discourse is without parallel in Irish life. I hope and pray he pulls through his current illness.", "Imageurl": "3211", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2990", "Heading": "Pray for Garret, an inspiration to us all"}
