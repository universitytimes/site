Hayden and fellow winner Clare Herbert of UCD will both travel to Malawi later this year to produce on-the-ground media reports on the issues of justice and gender equality.\n\nHayden will examine the position of women in Malawi one year after the first female President, Joyce Banda, took power. As part of her prize, she will be mentored by The Irish Times.\n\nThe Simon Cumbers Media Fund &ndash; which is supported by Irish Aid &ndash; is designed to increase informed coverage of global development issues in the Irish media by offering support and funding to Irish journalists who wish to report on relevant stories abroad.\u00a0Previously, journalists including Fergal Keane of RTE, Orla Barry of Newstalk and\u00a0 Suzanne Lynch of the Irish Times have been financed by the Media Fund to report from South Sudan, Ethiopia and Tanzania and Uganda.\u00a0The winners were decided by panel of judges, which includes representatives of the Irish Times and Newstalk, Storyful.com, and Irish Aid.\n\nAt the\u00a0prize-giving ceremony in Trinity today, the T\u00e1naiste Eamon Gilmore spoke of the importance of the work of journalists in highlighting social injustice and driving progress. 'Through their work, Sally and Clare will be able to highlight the importance of justice, human rights and gender equality in improving the lives of vulnerable communities in the developing world. The stories they report back will, no doubt, illustrate the important progress being made in Malawi, but also the many challenges still facing ordinary people there.\n\nThe Simon Cumbers Media Fund was established by Irish Aid in memory of Irish journalist Simon Cumbers, who was killed in Saudi Arabia while working with the BBC in 2004.\u00a0In addition to securing a budget to cover travel and accommodation costs, the successful students will be offered guidance and one-to-one mentoring from journalists within two of Ireland&rsquo;s leading media organisations: The Irish Times&rsquo; Foreign Policy Editor, Paddy Smyth; and Managing Editor at Storyful.com, Markham Nolan.", "Imageurl": "16365", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "16361", "Heading": "Trinity student wins prestigious journalism scholarship"}
