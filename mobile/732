{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>The Irish Student Drama Association (commonly referred to as ISDA) is the umbrella organisation of Ireland&rsquo;s most prolific third-level drama societies. It aims to provide a national platform through which student drama may be promoted and encouraged and acts as a forum through which students from the drama societies of different third-level institutions can come together and interact on a creative and social level. Membership of the organisation is open to any drama society from a third-level institution on the island of Ireland.</p>\n<p>The highlight of the ISDA year is the association&rsquo;s annual theatre festival and award ceremony &ndash; a week-long festival in which all member societies may display their shows and compete. This year Trinity is hosting the event with the festival running from the 8th- 13th of March. Twelve universities participate in the festival amongst them University College Dublin, University College Cork, National University of Galway, Ulster University, Dublin City University and Dublin Institute of Technology. The ISDA has produced the talent of actors such as Pauline McLynn, Fiona Shaw and Conor McPherson. This is its 62nd year running. Some of the events taking place during the week include &lsquo;Bang Bang You&rsquo;re Dead&rsquo; at DIT Black Box Theatre at 1pm on Thursday and &lsquo;Frozen&rsquo; at The Project Cube at 5pm on Friday. &nbsp;DU Players will of course also be producing their own shows for the festival. On Thursday evening &lsquo;Mercury Fur&rsquo; will be playing at 8pm in the Players Theatre.</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>The Irish Student Drama Association (commonly referred to as ISDA) is the umbrella organisation of Ireland&rsquo;s most prolific third-level drama societies.
