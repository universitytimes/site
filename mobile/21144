{"Body": "For current Trinity undergrads, the nineties were spent watching Barney and eating jelly tots. We had no major style guide, and usually rocked up to the playground in an eclectic and sometimes insanely dodgy attire. Jumpers were scratchy, scrunchies a necessity of life, and red velvet dungarees were repeatedly forced on us by our tyrannical mothers. Unfortunately the photographic evidence of which lives on, usually for the purpose of mortifying us at twenty-first birthday parties.\r\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">the nineties were spent watching Barney and eating jelly tots</blockquote>\r\nNow one of the staples of nineties fashion, Grunge, has made a return. Jean Paul Gaultier told Vogue in 1993 that &ldquo;grunge is how we dress when we have no money.&rdquo; If there was ever a style mantra that students could hang on to, it&rsquo;s this one. After a night out, it is the natural choice for those students who are too hung over to be primped and polished at nine in the morning, and too broke to afford new tights.\r\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">&ldquo;grunge is how we dress when we have no money.&rdquo;</blockquote>\r\nThe 2013 autumn/winter catwalks were awash with rebellious and gothic styles. Trends in the same sphere as Grunge, such as Punk, Minimalism and Monochrome were integral to the fall catwalks. The trend's re-emergence was marketed as Luxe Grunge, with the traditionally ladylike Yves Saint Laurent chopping ball gowns and layering them under knitted cardigans and biker jackets, along with netted tights. On the high street the grunge influence can be seen from Forever 21 to Topshop. Baggy tailoring and tartan prints are everywhere. Zara have really encapsulated the trend with a fresh and modern take. A check mini skirt which has the air of a gossip girl uniform has a black lining poking out an inch below the trim which transforms it from preppy to grunge. The new Rihanna for River Island collection is like flicking through the pop star&rsquo;s own grunge-centric wardrobe and her limited collection with Mac draws attention to the Grunge staples of dark kohled eyes and dark stained lips.\r\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: left; margin: 0 24px 24px 24px;\">Baggy tailoring and tartan prints are everywhere</blockquote>\r\nOn campus, both male and female Trinity students have really embraced this androgynous trend. Perhaps this is due to the simplicity of the pieces, it's somewhat minimalist and more practical than many other trends. Acid wash denim is being worn by most, particularly as jackets and jeans with rolled up ends. The simple but eye catching red tartan scarf has also been a popular choice. This year many girls have opted for even bolder lip colors, rich shades of plum and burgundy standing especially. The low maintenance aesthetic and high street presence has no doubt allowed this trend to become popular among Trinity students. The budget friendly aspect is an essential part of the Grunge aesthetic. It definitely has the potential to hold its place at the top of the fashion pyramid for some time to come.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/student-grunge.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21144", "Heading": "Student Grunge"}
