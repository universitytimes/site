The show was created by Josh &nbsp;Shwartz (The OC, Gossip Girl) and Chris Fedak and premiered in 2007.

This gained momentum and culminated in Zachary Levi (Chuck) leading a group of hundreds of fans to a subway restaurant in Birmingham, England.

With this week&rsquo;s cancellation of Jay Leno&rsquo;s primetime show perhaps NBC will have be better able to cope with Chuck&rsquo;s expensive budget.
