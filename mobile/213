The current assistant campaigns officer for the SU, it&rsquo;s fair to say that Barry has spent much of the year preparing for this race, being highly visible as an organiser of the &ldquo;Education not Emigration&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Vote&rdquo; campaigns.\n\nBarry has held numerous positions on various student bodies, including a stint on the SU Electoral Commission, a Law Soc class rep and a committee rep on the netball club. The twenty-two year old is one of three Law students vying for a position on next year&rsquo;s Sabbatical team.\n\nWith an intimate knowledge of the demands of the office, Barry hopes to bring the committee work of the Education Officer out of the meeting rooms and into the light by providing a fortnightly report on the progress of the SU in campaigning or increased library hours and a better plan for semesterisation.\n\nBarry also wants to see the Education Officer take a more proactive view in formulating policy with the College Board instead of adopting a reactionary stance to decisions made within the academic community. With a new Provost in place and a reshuffle in the various positions of authority, Barry sees an opportunity for the student body to assert itself in the new hierarchy.\n\nOne issue on which Barry sees a real lack of progress is Christmas Exams. While 90% of students voted in favour of Christmas exams last year, there have been no announcements of any new policies from college to accommodate the obvious student opposition to the lack of continued assessment.\n\n&ldquo;Trinity is falling behind other colleges on this issue,&rdquo; says Barry. &ldquo;Continuous assessment improves overall academic performance and doesn&rsquo;t adversely affect the college experience. A clear proposal taking into account differences in faculties and drawing on examples of semesterisation in other colleges should be drawn up and presented to college by the start of next academic year .&rdquo;\n\nRecognising the plight facing many undergrads entering the job market, Barry wants to see the SU organising graduate fairs where Trinity students can meet prospective employers face-to-face and get information on internships and job prospects.", "Imageurl": "<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: right; font: 13.0px 'Helvetica Neue'} p.p2 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 10.0px; font: 9.0px 'Whitney HTF'} span.s1 {letter-spacing: -0.1px} -->Rachel Barry\n\nSS Law\n\n<strong>Education Officer</strong>\n\nThis Wicklow girl with a Liverpudlian twang looks set to be the only Education Officer candidate from the Arts Block.
