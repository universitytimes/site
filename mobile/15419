So far, we&rsquo;ve had reputations backed up, enhanced and destroyed. We&rsquo;ve seen hotpot favourites turned over and long odds no-hopers sweep to victory. Hopefully we&rsquo;ve all had a few winners and made a few quid. If you haven&rsquo;t, today is the day your luck changes. If you have, let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t take more money from the bookies&rsquo; tills.</span>\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">1.30 JCB Triumph Hurdle</span></strong>\n\nThe opening race of the day has been highly hyped as a straight shootout between two great prospects; one English, one Irish. Our Conor, \u00a0the Irish hope, represents Dessie Hughes, who&rsquo;s horses have been in great form so far this week, without quite managing to land in the winner&rsquo;s enclosure. Our Conor has done nothing wrong, winning all three of his starts over hurdles, and he rightly heads the betting. There is a strong trend amongst previous winners of the race for having their final prep run in February. This horse meets those requirements, further strengthening his claims.\n\nThe leading English hope is Rolling Star, from the powerful team of Barry Geraghty and Nicky Henderson. Like Our Conor, he is undefeated over hurdles, albeit after one less run, and having won in slightly less convincing circumstances. A fantastic prospect nonetheless.\n\nAnother horse meriting discussion is Far West, for the out of form Paul Nicholls&rsquo; yard. He has won the two Cheltenham trials for this race by convincing margins. However, his opposition has not been in the same class as that beaten by the two market leaders.\n\nBeyond these three, the market really opens up, with a number of bigger priced runners. Some no without their chance are Willie Mullins&rsquo; Diakali (possessing a win over Festival winner Flaxen Flare and a second last time out to Our Conor), Stocktons Wing and Hidden Justice, the mount of Paul Carberry. In truth, the first three home should probably be the first three in the betting.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Winner:</strong> Our Conor</span>\n<strong>Each Way:</strong> Far West probably too skinny pricewise, Diakali appeals for trainer bang in form\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2.05 Vincent O&rsquo;Brien County Hurdle</strong></p>\nThis race has been somewhat of a friend to the bookmakers in recent years, with long odds winners for the past five renewals and no favourite first home since 2006. With that in mind, picking a winner can be tricky business.\n\nA horse which appeals upon some study is Tanerko Emery, running for the David Pipe yard. He is not carrying too much weight and fits some of the trends of previous winners, having had more than four runs this season, as well as having placed second in the Imperial Cup at Sandown last time out. With the winner of that not running here, this horse has a good chance of continuing the Pipe yard&rsquo;s lofty reputation in handicaps.\n\nHeading the market currently is Cotton Mill, trained by John Ferguson. Second in the Betfair Hurdle to Supreme Novice&rsquo;s favourite My Tent or Yours, he has long since been favourite for this race. While unable to land a blow on My Tent or Yours that day, he did finish ahead of some very smart horses and has paid heavily in the handicap for that.\n\nThe Irish have a good record in this race, and our leading hopes come in the form of Ted Veale (Tony Martin) and Tennis Cap (Willie Mullins). Tennis Cap had a poor run over Christmas at Leopardstown but has since overcome that to record some impressive wins. Ted Veale, who&rsquo;s trainer is having a good week, fared much better at the Christmas meeting in Dublin 4, as he recorded a creditable 3rd in the Boylesports Hurdle, a race in which a good run is a positive indicator of chances here. He also carries far less weight than the Mullins&rsquo; charge.\n\n<strong>Winner:</strong> Ted Veale looks well treated by the handicapper for a canny trainer\n<strong>Each way:</strong> Hard to split Tennis Cap and Tanerko Emery, running off the same weight. Form of Tanerko Emery maybe slightly shades it.\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>2.40 Albert Bartlett Novice&rsquo;s Hurdle</strong></p>\nThere are very strong trends for this race, judging from previous runnings. Previous quality form at Cheltenham (not necessarily the Festival) and a run at three miles previous to this race are important. 7 year olds have a good record, as do those who are in the first five in the betting.\n\nWith that in mind, the race looks at the mercy of At Fisher&rsquo;s Cross, for the team of Rebacca Curtis and Tony McCoy, still winless at this year&rsquo;s Festival. He has won over three miles on soft ground, suggesting he could make the trip even easier on the likely better ground. Though he is only 5, he possesses excellent previous form at Cheltenham, having beaten the Neptune Hurdle winner The New One last time out in Prestbury Park.\n\nNigel Twiston-Davies is having a quietly good week and saddles African Gold here. Though yet to run over the full 3 miles, he has consistently won over 2 miles 5 furlongs on soft ground, so getting the trip may not be such a problem.\n\nWillie Mullins has a runner with a similar problem, Ballycasey. Yet to run over three miles, he has won over 2 miles 6f on heavy ground, and judging if a horse will get the distance is usually not a problem for the Co Carlow maestro.\n\nHaving paired up for a winner today, Jonjo O&rsquo;Neil and Richie McLernon have Cloudy Cooper here, a six year old who has won over a trip of more than three miles in a very handy manner. Proven stamina over the trip and a larger price may appeal for each way money.\n\n<strong>Winner:</strong> Everything looks set up for At Fisher&rsquo;s Cross\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Each Way:</strong> Interesting if African Gold gets the trip, but Cloudy Cooper could have a big run in him</span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>3.20 Gold Cup</strong></p>\nThe Gold Cup is the centrepiece of the week&rsquo;s racing, which says quite a lot about the esteem in which it is held. A lot of the attention leading up to the Festival centred around a horse who won&rsquo;t be racing: Kauto Star, who retired after having his final run in last year&rsquo;s renewal. The horse racing media have been asking quite loudly if they is a horse capable of stepping into the void left by one of the finest chasers of his, or indeed any other, generation. However, the search for this comparison may be more than a little unfair to the contenders in what is a cracking renewal of this race<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">.</span>\n\nLeading the betting market is Nicky Henderson&rsquo;s Bob&rsquo;s Worth, winner of the RSA Chase at last year&rsquo;s Cheltenham. He possesses more winning Festival form, coming home first in the Albert Bartlett Novice&rsquo;s Hurdle in 2011. His only run since the Festival last year was in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in December, where he was also victorious. He has done little wrong, but his lack of runs may count against him. Some rather harshly dismiss him as a jumped up handicapper.\n\nGiven his form this week, eyes are drawn immediately to Ruby Walsh and his mount Silviniaco Conti for the Paul Nicholls&rsquo; stable. On his way to this race, Conti has swatted aside fellow Gold Cup runners such as The Giant Bolster and Long Run in races at Haydock and Newbury. Unbeaten over three starts this season, his second as a chaser, has Nicholls quite confident of this being his best hope for what has been a disappointing week. He has looked nothing but impressive as he attempts to reclaim the Gold Cup for the former trainer of the aforementioned Kauto Star.\n\nThe leading Irish contender is Sir Des Champs, from the all-conquering Willie Mullins stable, running in the colours of Michael O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s Gigginstown Stud. He is a two time winner at the Festival, winning the Jewson Chase at last year&rsquo;s meeting. Indeed, so impressed with that run, I went out and backed him for this race the very next day. His travails over the winter in his budding rivalry with Flemenstar had me worried for a time, as he struggled to stamp his class in races he clearly had the ability to win. However, a step up to 3 miles at Leopardstown in February allowed him to finally show what he is all about as he established himself as a clear front-runner for this Gold Cup. The drying ground only helps his cause.\n\nA horse I fancy to out-run his price is Captain Chris, trained by Philip Hobbs. Hobbs has been vocal in the run-up to this race about his hopes for this horse to run a big race. Just touched off by Long Run in the King George VI Chase on St Stephen&rsquo;s Day and beaten by Cue Card in February after a terrible jumping mistake, he is teak tough and gets the trip. Expect a good battling run.\n\n<strong>Winner:</strong> Sir Des Champs really appeals\n<strong>Each Way:</strong> Captain Chris\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>4.00 Foxhunter&rsquo;s Chase</strong></p>\nThere is a big field in this amateur riders&rsquo; race, which makes it doubly difficult to pick with a huge amount of certainty.\n\nThe top two in the betting are the first two home in last year&rsquo;s renewal, Salsify and Chapoturgeon. Last year&rsquo;s winner Salsify was kept busy after the Festival, though took three attempts to eventually see off Tammys Hill by a neck after a few blunders on his seasonal reappearance. Chapotugeon won easily on his own reappearance, though finished a poor third in at Aintree last April.\n\nFergal O&rsquo;Brien has in interesting runner in the form of Creevytenant, who he recently got back from a long break away from the track. He made an impressive return, making all to win by a street a Mussleborough in February.\n\n<strong>Winner:</strong> The extra bit of youth in Salsify&rsquo;s legs could see him retain\n<strong>Each Way:</strong> Creevytenant could surprise people and will not be afraid to lead off\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">4.40 Martin Pipe Handicap Hurdle</span></strong>\n\nThis race has produced some big name winners in its short history. Both Sir Des Champs and Son of Flicka have gone on to bigger and better Festival feats having won this race. Class seems to count here as horses near the top of the handicap have always fared well. It is little wonder that Michael O&rsquo;Leary has such notable representation as this race has been very kind to him.\n\nHis main threats here are Edeymi (Tony Martin) and Toner D&rsquo;Oudairies (Gordon Elliot). After finishing second in last year&rsquo;s Fred Winter, Edeymi has done relatively little and his formbook doesn&rsquo;t prove overly impressive. However, positive previous Festival experience can be invaluable. Toner D&rsquo;Oudairies, on the otherhand, has kept some impressive company, finishing a few places behind 2013 Festival winners Lord Windermere and Benefficent as well as behind Aupcharlie, who himself has a very impressive form book. May be the pick of the Gigginstown lot.\n\nDavid Pipe would dearly love to win this race named in his father&rsquo;s honour and he saddles the favourite, Gevrey Chamertin. He is a perfect three for three over hurdles and has paid for it in being pushed to the top of the weights. Nicky Henderson enjoys this race and the pick of his lot here is Ma Filleule, who impressively bet former Festival winner and 3rd placed in this year&rsquo;s Mare&rsquo;s Hurdle, Swincombe Flame. She has been chasing so her experience could stand to her.\n\n<strong>Winner:</strong> David Pipe may honour his father with a win, though don&rsquo;t be surprised to see Toner D&rsquo;Oudairies further back up an impressive formbook.\n<strong>Each Way:</strong> \u00a0Ma Filleule sticks out for me for her last run and her favourable handicap. May fill the third spot\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>5.15 Grand Annual Handicap Chase</strong></p>\nSo we&rsquo;ve made it to the end. The final race is likely to be the refuge of the desperate, searching around for any little slice of comfort they can find in a sea of losing bets, beaten favourites and dodgy tips. Big prices have been prominent in this race over the last few years, maybe sticking a pin in the card is the preferred method here. We&rsquo;ve made it this far together, so let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t land one last winner\n\nNicky Henderson has a glut of runners in this race: Kid Cassidy and Petit Robin being the two most impressive. The weights have not been kind to Petit Robin after a 5th place behind My Tent or Yours at Newbury, but Kid Cassidy is nicely weighted and has the clever Paul Carberry on board.\n\nLeading the market is Alderwood for Tom Mullins. A nice novice chaser who won all around him over the smaller obstacles, he hasn&rsquo;t set the world on fire yet, though is only two runs into his chasing career. As a result of his inexperience, he is carrying a decent weight.\n\nKumbeshswar has been keeping some very good company this season, finishing second to both Sprinter Sacre and Sanctuaire. His weight is hardly prohibitive and is available at prices which could dig one or two punters out of a hole.\n\n<strong>Winner</strong>: Kid Cassidy meets a lot of the positive trends for this race while I just worry about Alderwood&rsquo;s lack of experience over fences.\n<strong>Each Way</strong>: Petit Robin has all the class here. His weight may prevent a winning run, but good enough to place. Kumbeshwar could and should run quite well, might be a bit of a saver for people.", "Imageurl": "15420", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15419", "Heading": "Cheltenham '13: Final Day Preview"}
