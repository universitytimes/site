We were also generously supported by the Trinity Association and Trust and the Provost's Office for the project.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">&ldquo;It's an exciting time to see all the work come to fruition in the final product and we are really looking forward to making an impact on these worthy educational causes. The calendars will be available in the SU Shops, the Library Shop and at stalls around the college next week, retailing at &euro;10.&rdquo;</span>\r\n\r\nThe calendar will be affiliated with the college and Trinity logos will be included on it.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Next week will also see the launch of the Trinity Cancer Soc Naked Calendar, which will feature writers from\u00a0</span><em style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">The University Times </em><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">as well as members of\u00a0The Phil, The Hist, TTV and Trinity FM, among others.
