{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>Steph Fleming is a 4th year Physiotherapy student, originally from County Cork, who says that her reasons for running for the position of Welfare Officer are simple: she&rsquo;s passionate about Welfare services and thinks that she would be good at the job. &ldquo;Studying physiotherapy, I&rsquo;ve been in some pretty intense work environments, intensive care units, The National Rehab centre. I&rsquo;ve treated patients who have gone through the toughest times of their lives. I will work hard to help people. I&rsquo;m very passionate about it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>If elected, the first thing she wants to do is to make the Welfare services &ldquo;as accessible as possible&rdquo;. She points out that some students have very long days in college and thinks that the Welfare office should have evening hours at least one day a week to accommodate this. Fleming wants to bring increased accessibility to off-campus sites also. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s hundreds of students based elsewhere. I want to make sure that Welfare services get to these sites too.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Fleming also sees increased LGBT awareness as a priority. &ldquo;I want Rainbow Week to also reach out to people who don&rsquo;t necessarily see themselves as LGBT. LGBT has expanded to LGBTQ - Q being questioning, as in you&rsquo;re not really sure who you are yet. You find yourself in college &ndash; it might be a clich&eacute; but it&rsquo;s also true. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re coming out as gay, lesbian or bi, college is a place where you find the opportunity to do that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fleming speaks passionately about her belief in the importance of the Welfare position. &ldquo;It takes a lot of courage to seek help. I think there is a feeling in Ireland that seeking help is a sign of weakness, that people should be able to stand up for themselves. But I want to ensure that people feel secure and happy and confident &ndash; if they&rsquo;re having problems, make sure they know that they&rsquo;re not dealing with it on their own.&rdquo;</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>Steph Fleming is a 4th year Physiotherapy student, originally from County Cork, who says that her reasons for running for the position of Welfare Officer are simple: she&rsquo;s passionate about Welfare services and thinks that she would be good at the job. &ldquo;Studying physiotherapy, I&rsquo;ve been in some pretty intense work environments, intensive care units, The National Rehab centre.
