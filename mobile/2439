{"Body": "Daniella Ryan\n\nLast Monday saw the official launch of David Norris&rsquo;s campaign for president, held in the Science Gallery in Trinity. Primarily an event attended by press, it felt more like a room of excited supporters. The enthusiasm in the room was palpable. Norris took to the podium to applause and began his speech by announcing that he was indeed seeking &ldquo;the highest office in the land&rdquo;. He acknowledged that the victory he seeks will not be easy, but that he seeks the office &ldquo;not for its glories, but for the difference it can make&rdquo;. During his speech, Norris made reference to past presidents, noting his believe that the office of president &ldquo;exemplifies all that is good about our country&rdquo;.\n\nThe senator highlighted mental health as a cornerstone issue of his campaign, and made reference to the figure of 527 people who committed suicide in Ireland in 2009 alone and vowed to &ldquo;remove the stigma and meet the crisis head-on&rdquo;. This figure, he said, highlights the rise of a silent crisis in a country whose people above all must find a way to &ldquo;renew their self belief&rdquo;. It is in the nature of Irish people to &ldquo;endure, overcome and succeed&rdquo;, he said, and we must become a country which &ldquo;values its young, respects its old and cherishes all of the people of the nation equally&rdquo;.\nThe floor was opened for questions after the speech, and unsurprisingly, the vast majority of the questions focused directly or indirectly on Norris&rsquo;s sexuality. In fact, an Irish Times reporter who received first question privileges opened with &ldquo;you have never been shy about your sexuality&hellip;&rdquo; and questions from other reporters followed that pattern for the most part. Norris, appearing unfazed and unbothered by questions pertaining to his sexuality did at one point inject a reality check for journalists seemingly stuck on the issue, by announcing to applause, that while he has no problem answering their questions, he believes that the Irish people are rather &ldquo;bored&rdquo; by his sexuality at this stage.\n\nAsked whether he would be willing to take a pay cut were he to win the office of president, he said that he does not believe he needs the full salary (currently &euro;250,000) and that he plans to set aside a significant proportion of the salary which he would invest in making the presidency more accessible to the people, but refrained from giving details on exactly how much he meant by &ldquo;significant figure&rdquo;.\n\nIn a quick interview granted to the University Times, third in line after RTE and TV3, I asked Norris did he have a message of support for the students of Ireland, graduating into uncertain times, to which he replied that we &ldquo;do have a lot to be positive about&rdquo; but that we also must be &ldquo;realistic&rdquo;. To the question of emigration he believes that students should travel to gain experience &ldquo;if necessary&rdquo;. This, he believes is &ldquo;not the end of the world&rdquo;, but he continued on; &ldquo;the one thing I would say is please, if it&rsquo;s possible, stay here. We are going to lift this country up again, and I want you all around when this happens&rdquo;. To hear David Norris speak, one could not help feeling hopeful, and it is indeed very difficult not to believe him.", "Imageurl": "2440", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2439", "Heading": "Norris launches presidential bid on campus"}
