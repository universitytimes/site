{"Body": "Kayla Walsh\n\nFlirtation has come a long way over the centuries. Gone are the knights in shining armour, rescuing fair damsels and prancing about on their white steeds. Lost are the penniless poets scribbling sonnets for their sweethearts and the enamoured minstrels serenading their loved ones in the middle of the night. These days, romance is a whole different ball game. For students, it often goes only as far as getting the casual shift with sweaty strangers in Alchemy on a Monday night, sending sexy drunken text messages, or posting about the babes in the library on &ldquo;Like a Little&rdquo; (and there are some serious babes). But though times have changed, men and women still remain utterly puzzled by each other. Girls wonder why their boyfriends won&rsquo;t listen to them when they point out that their pink shirt/red hoodie combination is hideous. Boys don&rsquo;t understand why their girlfriends complain so much. Have you ever wanted to know the solution to perfect harmony between the sexes? Then Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus is the book for you.\n\nMen are from Mars, Women are from Venus is a self-help book by John Gray that was enormously popular in the 1990s. As the title suggests, the text asserts that men and women have numerous differences, to such an extent that they are like beings from separate planets. Gray explains how a lack of understanding of these differences can negatively affect relationships. He gives a practical guide to improving communication between the sexes, even including a handy Venusian/Martian phrase dictionary. He describes how men and women have different emotional needs, and want different types of love. He demonstrates how giving the right kind of love allows both partners to &ldquo;win&rdquo; in their relationship (a sort of bi-winning situation?). I found out exactly how men are like rubber bands, and women are like waves. I was given the secret to scoring points with boys, and even told how to write the perfect love letter! This could come in handy when I&rsquo;m trying to get an extension on my French essay&hellip;\n\nGray shows us that appreciating and respecting the differences between the sexes is the key to happiness in a heterosexual relationship. His chatty, colloquial style is easy to read, if at times a little condescending. Though he can be repetitive, he provides funny, relevant examples to keep the reader interested. Some of his tips were bizarre, such as &ldquo;Remember to give your woman four hugs a day&rdquo;. Others like &ldquo;Make sure to laugh at her jokes and humour&rdquo; and &ldquo;Practise listening to her without looking at your watch&rdquo; were downright offensive! However, in general his advice is useful and applicable to everyone, from teenagers to elderly couples. I believe every student should read this book. Even if you take it with a pinch of salt, it is an entertaining read, and I honestly believe it contains many valuable insights into the conduct of both sexes. And hey, if it&rsquo;s good enough for Bridget Jones, it&rsquo;s good enough for anyone!\n", "Imageurl": "2340", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2339", "Heading": "Books Every Student Should Read: Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus by John Gray "}
