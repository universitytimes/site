{"Body": "<strong>Shona McGarry</strong>\n<em>Societies</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Who?</em>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What do you know about DU Film Soc? Well, there are two things you should know: one, they make films, and two, they watch films, every Thursday, advertised by kooky posters all over House 6, and run in association with a different society every week. So, they&rsquo;ve got everything covered: if you don&rsquo;t want to nerd out and become a cinematographer but like watching a bit of Donnie Darko on a Thursday evening, you&rsquo;re sorted. If you have big dreams of directing the next Moonrise Kingdom but find Disney movies a bit crap, you&rsquo;re also sorted. It&rsquo;s one of the most win-win situations of the week.</p>\n<em>What have Food &amp; Drink got to do with it?</em>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The crew down at the society (see what I did there?) are also a pretty intuitive bunch, so when it came to choosing a society to work with for their next screening - Pixar&rsquo;s Ratatouille - they decided that if there&rsquo;s one thing people like more than films, it&rsquo;s food, and if there&rsquo;s one thing better than food, it&rsquo;s eating it while in the company of talented voice artists. Hence, Thursday&rsquo;s event was born - Ratatouille, accompanied by copious amounts of Frenchified fancies, from baguettes to Brie. And, as far as Film Soc were concerned, Food &amp; Drink didn&rsquo;t disappoint - no matter how many projector issues one may have, once the wine is flowing, people will be happy.</p>\n<em>Wish I was there!</em>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don&rsquo;t worry, I was. I spent the first twenty minutes observing &lsquo;banter&rsquo; and staring at people in bowler hats, chunky glasses and unnecessary scarves (the Hist Conversation Room is notoriously posh and warm), while Food &amp; Drink cracked open bottles of fine French wine from Corkscrew, whom the committee plan on arranging wine tastings with later in the year. Nothing in Food &amp; Drink is &lsquo;&euro;4 Tesco wine&rsquo;, says the chair, Khalehla, who went to the AGM in first year &lsquo;on a whim&rsquo; and now finds herself as the chair of a society with over 1,200 new converts this year. Wednesday&rsquo;s cheese tasting was all Food and Drink , but they got into the spirit on Thursday with their French cheeses and vendors passing popcorn around. Now that&rsquo;s service. Needless to say, the fine wine made people almost as happy as the beanbags did (beanbags seem to make people happy at society events. It&rsquo;s just a weird quirk). Meanwhile, Film got their French on with no holds barred. Jazz music echoed as company arrived, and when the projector problems were solved, the chair, Cailan, thanked Food and Drink, and the lights were dimmed to add some French atmosphere. The first of the three French shorts was a cute one called &lsquo;Lights Out&rsquo;, which was duly stopped after three minutes with the chair sneakily explaining that &lsquo;the next one has a bit more of a story&rsquo;. They know what people want.</p>\n<em>Extra Extra!</em>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want more out of your Film Soc - and of course you do - here&rsquo;s what to do. Need help with a short film you&rsquo;ve been knocking around for the Toronto Film Festival? Just pop up to the room and get a mini-tutorial in cameras, mics, lights and just about anything else you need. Editing? Just look to the giant Apple Mac in the cosy society room, which is also a bit of a must-see - at the top of House 6 they compete against the Mario-and-Luigi sounds of the Sci Fi soc, papering the walls with posters of indie flicks like Drive and Rust and Bone and working on films, trailers, or a sparkling new poster for a killer event. As for Food and Drink, not only does their card give you discounts on everything from Mexican to burgers, this year is chock-full of events, with &lsquo;wine tastings, critic masterclasses, talks, and a food tour somewhere in Ireland&rsquo; definitely on the cards.</p>\n<em>Result</em>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Definitely a worthwhile way to spend a Thursday before you go wandering down to the Palace - head along to get a (sometimes literal) taste of another society while letting Film Soc lull you into their arms - and I mean that in as non-creepy a way as possible. Even if you&rsquo;re not into the film they&rsquo;re showing, the atmosphere is that of a relaxed saloon - fancy wine, a bit of food, and new people to chat with. And if you are into the movie on the screen, what better way to get to know it than by watching it with a swathe of film buffs? Next week they&rsquo;re convening with Scan Soc (that&rsquo;s Scandinavian to you and me) for another 7pm slot. See you there.</p>\n<em>Want more?</em>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Like most societies, they&rsquo;ve both got good Facebook pages, and both tweet away intermittently. DU Food and Drink also have a cute website at <a href=\"http://www.dufoodanddrink.com/\">www.dufoodanddrink.com</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Want to see your society featured in this section?
