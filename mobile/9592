Its central\u00a0episode, <em>Fifteen Million Merits</em>, is set in a dystopian future world in which fame is the only\u00a0escape. Like <em>Brave New World</em>, its society is rigidly stratified: the upper castes are allowed to\u00a0wear their own clothes and go outside; the middle castes wear grey uniforms, and are confined\u00a0indoors, spending their nights caged in cube-rooms whose walls are screens. They spend their\u00a0lives on stationary bikes, generating electricity and simultaneously earning &lsquo;merits&rsquo; which are\u00a0spent mainly on food and virtual items for their &lsquo;doppels&rsquo;, avatars similar to those the Wii\u00a0currently uses. The lower castes wear yellow, for which they are referred to as lemons, and\u00a0perform menial tasks like cleaning. A worker becomes a lemon when they become too old, or\u00a0fat, to generate enough electricity on a bike.\n\nThe workers cycle bikes before screens; wash before mirrors which double as screens;\u00a0sleep surrounded by screens. Attempting to skip commercials or mute entertainment incurs a\u00a0penalty. The main three programmes they watch are <em>Hot Shot</em>, an <em>X-Factor</em> style talent\u00a0show; <em>Wraith Babes</em> (&ldquo;The hottest girls in the nastiest situations&rdquo;), and <em>Botherguts</em>. We&rsquo;re only\u00a0shown a few seconds of <em>Botherguts</em>, when the protagonist&rsquo;s obnoxious work-neighbour watches\u00a0it, but it&rsquo;s immediately obvious what the show&rsquo;s premise is: obese people, dressed in lower-\u00a0caste yellow, gorge themselves on donuts and cakes in an attempt to win prizes, while the well-\u00a0dressed (and therefore famous and upper-caste) mock them. The camera bounces around\u00a0wackily. The fat people are stripped and covered in slop, or shown writhing like animals on the\u00a0floor, covered in food. Everyone laughs.\n\nOne of <em>Black Mirror</em>&rsquo;s primary themes is the dehumanising effect the television screen\u00a0has, both on the people who become objects for our entertainment, and the people who view\u00a0them. With Botherguts, this dehumanisation is conveyed in only a few seconds of screen-time,\u00a0but it&rsquo;s a shrewd observation of the intersection, in reality TV, of class tourism and groups of\u00a0people we still feel fairly comfortable about mocking - fat people. The fat people are marked by\u00a0their conspicuously yellow uniforms. They&rsquo;re acceptable targets because the audience is\u00a0allowed to feel itself better than them: richer and more attractive. The perceived gap, aided by\u00a0the distancing a screen creates, allows the audience to view the people as deserving of their\u00a0contempt: they couldn&rsquo;t take the biking, and therefore it&rsquo;s their own fault they&rsquo;re both fat and\u00a0poor. They deserve mockery.\n\nWhich is, of course, the implicit message of the dozens of fat-person documentaries out\u00a0there. <em>Botherguts</em> is a great little detail in <em>Black Mirror</em> because it&rsquo;s only a slightly exaggerated\u00a0example of something that already exists. Fat people are a group we, as a society, feel good\u00a0about criticising: the evidence of their supposed sins of gluttony and sloth are, after all, their\u00a0bodies. The majority of these &lsquo;documentaries&rsquo; about twenty-ton teenagers are little better than\u00a0obvious excuses to tune in and immediately feel better about ourselves: we may be overweight,\u00a0or unattractive, but we&rsquo;re better than them. Mocking the ugly is mean, after all, because they\u00a0can&rsquo;t help it, but mocking the fat (frequently under the guise of concern) is totally acceptable.\n\nWhich is also where the class-tourism element comes in: the people in these documentaries are\u00a0rarely, if ever, middle-class. The Chawner family make good viewing because we can sneer at\u00a0them for being fat and poor. They inspire our disdain, in the way that a show about, say, how\u00a0Fionnuala just can&rsquo;t make time for the gym between cello and extracurricular Russian, wouldn&rsquo;t.\u00a0Class-tourism, of course, also works the other way: we feel entitled to disdain, or even hate, the\u00a0stars of <em>Made in Chelsea</em> or <em>My Super Sweet Sixteen</em> because they&rsquo;re rich and spoiled and they\u00a0deserve it.\n\nWhich is where <em>Tallafornia</em> comes in. David Norris described the show&rsquo;s latest episode\u00a0as &ldquo;both compulsive and repulsive viewing.&rdquo; The usual accusations of moral laxity, debauchery,\u00a0and contributing-to-the-downfall-of-society have been thrown at it. It&rsquo;s held up, as is SOP with\u00a0these shows, as a mirror of how stupid and boorish society has become. We watch delightedly\u00a0as its stars get pissed and act as badly as we expect them to, and then we loudly disapprove of\u00a0them and mock their stupidity and boorishness. We can do this because we&rsquo;re doubly removed\u00a0from them: they&rsquo;re behind a screen, and therefore public objects we feel comfortable about\u00a0mocking, and from working class backgrounds, so the average middle-class viewer can have\u00a0their prejudices confirmed for them as they disapprove. They&rsquo;re an example of how dreadful a\u00a0certain section of society has become, and because they&rsquo;re not (the middle-class) Us, it&rsquo;s\u00a0therefore acceptable to ridicule and despise them. The illusion, of course, is that this outrage is\u00a0an organic reaction to what we&rsquo;re being shown. That these shows aren&rsquo;t designed to create this\u00a0very outrage; that the creators aren&rsquo;t counting on the enjoyment we get from sneering at what\u00a0we&rsquo;re shown. That the voyeurism of the class-tourist isn&rsquo;t being appealed to.\n\nWe&rsquo;re aware, of course, that the &lsquo;reality&rsquo; element is spurious at best, but we still seem to\u00a0subscribe to objectivity of the camera itself. That is, we don&rsquo;t question how the shot is framed,\u00a0or chosen, or eventually edited, and are accordingly disgusted by the girl on screen, and not\u00a0the camera posed to show us her underwear. We notice situations which are obviously false,\u00a0but will willingly accept that these people are just as terrible as the show needs them to be in\u00a0order to guarantee its success. We claim that they deserve our disgust &mdash; they signed up for\u00a0it, after all &mdash; but choose not to the acknowledge the complete lack of control the participants\u00a0have over how they&rsquo;re eventually represented. Norris&rsquo;s contention that <em>Tallafornia</em>&rsquo;s stars are\u00a0being exploited is a fairly obvious one, but the truth is that the audience is being exploited too &mdash;\u00a0namely, our willingness to hate the objects of our gaze, once a suitable distance (be it weight, or\u00a0class, or even just the glass of the television screen itself) has been established. The enjoyment\u00a0we get from mocking these people, and our sure conviction that they deserve it. Our belief that\u00a0we are morally superior to them, and that they deserve whatever treatment they get, because\u00a0they&rsquo;re on the other side of the screen.\n\nMany appraisals of reality TV tend to end with similar conclusions: this is bad, and you\u00a0should feel bad for watching this. But the multiple dynamics which inform this kind of television\u00a0&mdash; voyeurism, schadenfreude, class tourism, the relationship between subject/viewer and\u00a0object/viewed &mdash; are far too complex to be reduced in this way. People have always been\u00a0fascinated by the behaviour of others, particularly those at a cultural or social distance, and the\u00a0argument could certainly be made that reality TV is just a vehicle to facilitate this natural aspect\u00a0of human nature. If people are going to be stupid in front of a camera, they should simply accept\u00a0the consequences. But I would like to end by posing the reader a question: which is ultimately\u00a0more repulsive, a drunken girl simulating sex on screen, or thousands of people watching her,\u00a0comfortable in their smug disdain for the object of entertainment they&rsquo;ve been asking for all\u00a0along?", "Imageurl": "9598", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "9592", "Heading": "Black Mirror, Botherguts and Tallafornia"}
