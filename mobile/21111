{"Body": "Heading into Halloween week and, crucially, the last week before Reading Week (yay!) means that many societies are holding parties and other cute things to bid you farewell before you &ldquo;lock yourself in the library&rdquo; for a week. Below are some of our favourite options for this week&rsquo;s society explorers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Monday</strong>\r\nThe annual DU Players &lsquo;Freshers&rsquo; Coop&rsquo; kicks off on Monday, in which 50 freshers share in-jokes to a drunk audience of their mates. Always a good laugh albeit a strange experience, and goes on all week at 7.30pm. Arriving a bit earlier to get a ticket is advised.\r\n\r\n<strong>Tuesday</strong>\r\nEnvironment Society are holding their first &lsquo;lunch-time talk.&rsquo; A staple of last year, the lunch-time talks revolve around an environment-related topic, and invite members to come along and eat their lunch whilst weighing in on the topic or simply listening to others do so. This week&rsquo;s theme is &lsquo;Climate Change and Skepticism&rsquo; and all are invited irrespective of their expertise on the topic at hand. Head along to Room 50 in the Atrium at 2pm to check it out.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Polar Bears suffer from Climate Change\" src=\"http://www.migratoryconnectivityproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/polar_bears_cropped.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nAlso on Tuesday is DU Computer Science Society's <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.ie/event/8949202305/\"><em>Student Summit</em></a>, a free extension of the Dublin Web Summit. Given the main conference's inaccessible price of &euro;1000 per ticket, DUCSS are offering students the opportunity to experience some of its highlights for free, with speakers JP Rangaswami and Erik Lammerding. As well as that, numerous well-known start-ups will be in attendance for those looking for internships and graduate jobs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Wednesday</strong>\r\nThe ever-cute Visual Arts society are having a communal pumpkin-carving party on Halloween eve, and attendees are promised &ldquo;horror&rdquo; and &ldquo;blood.&rdquo; More likely, however, attendees can expect to be put to shame as artsy folk from the society create elaborate, well-thought-out masterpieces, and others struggle to make the first cut into a shoddily design orange nightmare. But you can&rsquo;t argue with free pumpkins, free carving utensils, free treats, and a vintage horror film to get you in the Halloween mood. The messiness takes place from 2.30-5pm in the Eliz Rooms (House 6, off the CSC office).\r\n\r\n<strong>Thursday</strong>\r\nOn Halloween day itself many societies are laying low, while their prospective audiences are too busy dressing themselves for the night ahead. One option is the Halloween-themed Phil debate on the motion &ldquo;This House Would Play God,&rdquo; which also encompasses pre-drinks for your night out in its post-debate reception. Key.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc9b7lmHQZ1rn2pfqo1_500.png\" />\n<strong>Friday</strong>\r\nVegetate and celebrate at the Pav. See you after Reading Week society people! (For those lurking around during the week, the Hist are still running their weekly Wednesday debate during Reading Week, with a more casual &ldquo;school&rsquo;s out&rdquo; atmosphere).", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/cat-pumpkin-carving-062.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21111", "Heading": "The Week in Societies: Halloween Edition"}
