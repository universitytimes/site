That&rsquo;s point number one. As I write this, Liverpool are sixth in the table. Our\u00a0main strike force consists of Andy Carroll, a man who has hit the woodwork so frequently\u00a0that he could be mistaken for a bad carpenter, and Luis Suarez, who&rsquo;s serving an 8 match\u00a0ban for a contentious altercation with Patrice Evra. Amongst our subs we have such match winners as Dirk\u00a0&lsquo;The Horse&rsquo; Kuyt, Martin &lsquo;Rice Cakes&rsquo; Kelly and Jon &lsquo;A for Effort&rsquo; Flanagan.\n\nNow don&rsquo;t get\u00a0me wrong, we have truly world class players in Steven Gerrard, when he&rsquo;s not under the\u00a0knife, Jamie Carragher, a man whose biological makeup is 90% steel, and Pepe Reina\u00a0who would put himself in front of a train if you asked him to, but things aren&rsquo;t going well for our standards.\n\nOur manager is Kenny Dalglish, probably the best player ever to wear a\u00a0Liverpool jersey, and a ?ne manager to us now, hence why a top 4 ?nish looks within our\u00a0reach, and come May I hope we&rsquo;ll be preparing for the Champion&rsquo;s League. But for now\u00a0the priority has to be stringing some results together, and ?nding a striker who knows\u00a0where the net is.\n\nBut that doesn&rsquo;t matter.\n\nWhen I was growing up, Liverpool were ending their reign as English and European kings.\u00a0In fact as soon I was born, Liverpool stopped winning the league. Their record breaking\u00a018th league title was in the &rsquo;89-&rsquo;90 season. Manchester United won their 19th title in 2011;\u00a0this was a big kick in the testicles. In 2005, Liverpool won the Champion&rsquo;s League in the most amazing manner. I don&rsquo;t need to tell you about that night in Istanbul, you all know the\u00a0fairytale, and have watched the DVD. (Steven Gerrard again proving he&rsquo;s worth ?fty times\u00a0his weight in some material more valuable than gold.) The following season, &lsquo;05-&rsquo;06\u00a0Liverpool won the F.A. Cup (Steven Gerrard again) and that&rsquo;s when the trophies stopped.\n\nBut that doesn&rsquo;t matter.\n\nIt&rsquo;s a bizarre emotion that goes with supporting Liverpool F.C. It&rsquo;s a mix of expectancy,\u00a0complacency, inevitable disappointment and eternal hope come August. The neighbours\u00a0don&rsquo;t help. Across the river you&rsquo;ll ?nd the bitter rivals who wear blue and ironically sold you\u00a0your house, but they&rsquo;re only small ?sh. Then, a bit up the road, you have the arch\u00a0enemies, who wear red, who you meet all too frequently, and the world watches on. The\u00a0arch enemies who stole your favourite record, and look bound to steal your others. And\u00a0wow do they hate you, they even talk about you when you&rsquo;re not around. They&rsquo;re clearly\u00a0obsessed. And there are new ones popping up all the time as money comes into the\u00a0neighborhood.\n\nThere are the new rich boys who wear light blue, who also hate your arch\u00a0enemies, which is always nice, except when they&rsquo;re buying every player that has legs. And\u00a0then there&rsquo;s that Russian family who live much further down the road, who stole your\u00a0favorite family member. But then he contracted no-goal-itis so it&rsquo;s okay.\n\nBut that doesn&rsquo;t matter.\n\nHome is where the heart is, and our home may be smaller than all the other&rsquo;s, but it&rsquo;s quite\u00a0a place to be. A place that can send the chills up your spine as soon as you walk in, a\u00a0place where you know everyone is family. The pictures on our walls aren&rsquo;t bad either,\u00a0especially that one everyone likes to touch. It&rsquo;s a place with so much sentimental value,\u00a0you feel like you belong there as soon as you take your seat. I mean sure, the neighbours\u00a0have bigger houses, and more money, and they&rsquo;re doing better in the league, but when\u00a0we&rsquo;re home, on a big European night, and &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll Never Walk Alone&rdquo; starts playing over the\nsound system, there&rsquo;s no where else you&rsquo;d rather be.\n\nFootball is not a matter of life or death; it&rsquo;s much more than that.", "Imageurl": "7549", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "7548", "Heading": "You'll (still) Never Walk Alone"}
