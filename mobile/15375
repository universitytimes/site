There&rsquo;s no doubt as to what, or who, the highlight of Wednesday&rsquo;s racing is going to be. All eyes will be on the machine that is Sprinter Sacre at 3.20 as he seeks to extend his undefeated record over fences to eight and collect what will hopefully be his first of many Champion Chase titles. This aeroplane&rsquo;s price leaves little value to punters, though, and at odds of 1/4 this race is one to sit back and enjoy without a bet.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">But that&rsquo;s not what we want, we want winners and lots of them. Houblon des Obeaux strikes me as the bet of the day, if not the week, in the RSA Chase at 2.40. This is without a doubt one of the toughest races on first season chasers, and it takes a real grinder and strong horse to come out on top here. Venetia William&rsquo;s charge has consistently ran well this season, winning a Grade 2 at Wincanton on his second chase start, racing prominently before staying on strongly over an extended 2 \u02dd miles in testing ground. He hasn&rsquo;t won since then in a couple of starts, but has run well in defeat, particularly last time out when a length runner up behind Rocky Creek, keeping on really well. This is the type of horse that really relishes the gruelling extended three miles here and the continuing softening of the ground will be right up his street and I think 14/1 represents some really good each way value to punters.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Tofino Bay will relish the testing going and marathon trip in the opening race and at 12/1 is a fairly big price. A smart hurdler, he has proved an even better chaser, notably landing the Troytown at Navan back in November over 3 miles in really testing ground off a mark of 134, which was a very smart performance, especially for a novice. He matched that when beating Aupcharlie in a Grade 2 the next time out, so it was a bit disappointing to be beaten last time out at Navan behind Terminal, but he is a real slogger and should improve for the step up in trip on this soft ground. The booking of Nina Carberry is a real positive, too.</span>\n\nPont Alexandre has been the subject of really glowing reports from Willie Mullins and Ruby Walsh, being touted as a potential superstar, and has been backed accordingly for the Neptune Novices&rsquo; Hurdle at 2.05. Winning a Grade 1 on his first start in Ireland, he was a facile victor of a Leopardstown Grade 2 at the end of January. He could well be a class above the rest of these in what looks a weak enough renewal, but an each way chance is taken on Rule The World at 6/1. Mouse Morris&rsquo; charge is 3 from 4 over hurdles in Ireland and was most impressive last time out when easily defeating Minsk, with a below par Champagne Fever back in third. He is a winning point to pointer and has stamina in abundance so this 2 \u02dd mile trip in testing ground will be of no concern to him, and looks a solid each way bet.\n\nThe Coral Cup (4.00) looks as competitive as ever for a handicap with plenty in with strong shouts. A chance is taken on Meister Eckhart at 14/1. Lightly raced since going to England having won two bumpers in Ireland, he ran a very good race last year in the Albert Bartlett when fifth behind the ill-fated Brindizi Breeze. He returned to action just three weeks ago when second to Prospect Wells at Fontwell, never catching the easy winner. That said, it was a most encouraging run after nearly a year off and that run should have him spot on for this. 14/1 is a decent each way price, while Hollow Tree could be very well handicapped off a mark of 139, and not one to rule out at 33/1.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The other two races on the card look like a bit of a minefield. Novices handicap hurdles aren&rsquo;t ones I&rsquo;d generally bet on, but Habesh looks massively overpriced in the 4.40 at 50/1 in places. He&rsquo;s had just two starts over hurdles, winning the second at Listowel in September, beating a \u00a0good horse in Stockton&rsquo;s Wing into third (rated 133). He&rsquo;s fit from a spin around Dundalk and his rating of 126 may underestimate him, especially with a 5 pound claimer aboard. Not a race for big stakes, though.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Similarly, the last race, The Champion Bumper can be a bit of a lottery, with a big field of inexperienced horses with plenty of barging involved. The Irish traditionally do well in this, and Liz Doyle&rsquo;s Le Vant D&rsquo;antan heads the market following an impressive debut at Leopardstown. It&rsquo;s probably worth looking for a bit of value here though and an each way chance is taken on The Liquidator. David Pipe&rsquo;s five year old hasn&rsquo;t been out of the first two in three starts, including in a Listed bumper at Cheltenham in November and a valuable Fairyhouse race last back-end. He demolished a weak field at Exeter last time out and he represents top connections here and looks over priced compared to some of the others at 25/1.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">All of the above selections will probably finish dead last as a result of me fancying them, but the best of luck to all.</span>", "Imageurl": "15376", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cheltenham13", "ID": "15375", "Heading": "Cheltenham '13: Day Two Preview"}
