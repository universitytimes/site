{"Body": "Laura Morley\n\nA callow junior freshman, Trinity Ball seems but a distant myth to me.\u00a0 A legendary event which takes place annually on the hallowed grounds of my beloved Trinity, a place so adversely familiar.\u00a0 Older acquaintances had also passed on tales of the hushed rumours which were due to circulate the cobbled paths of the college- rumours regarding who would be appearing at the Ball weeks before it was ever announced.\u00a0 As you can well imagine, I was suitably disappointed when no such rumours seemed to materialise this year.\u00a0 However, I still await the Ball with baited breath and concentrate on the two substantial acts which\u00a0<em>have</em> been announced- Jessie J and Glasser.\n<h3>Jessie J</h3>\nNow, I&rsquo;m going to be absolutely honest here.\u00a0 Jessie J and Glasser have never been on my list of favourites.\u00a0 Not that I disliked them, but more that I hadn&rsquo;t ever explored their work.\u00a0 Of course I&rsquo;d seen the music video for Jessie J&rsquo;s &ldquo;Do It Like A Dude&rdquo; on NME while perusing the music chanels, and been intrigued by the whole aesthetic of the artist; her extroverted attitude, out-there costumery and decadent makeup.\u00a0 But while the tune of the track was admitedly quite catchy, I found the lyrics to be rather perplexing.\u00a0 All this talk of crotch-grabbing and &ldquo;rollin&rsquo; money like a pimp&rdquo; sounded more to me like something I would expect to hear in a 50 Cent song than that of a 22-year-old English girl named Jessica Ellen Cornish.\u00a0 However, on further investigation, I discovered that Jessie J is no novice to the music business, having written tracks for the likes of Justin Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys and Miley Cyrus.\u00a0 She has already been announced the winner of BBC&rsquo;s Sound of 2011, and been named second in MTV Brand New&rsquo;s &lsquo;Next Big Thing&rsquo;.\u00a0 All in all, Jessie J seems like a pretty impressive act to have been secured by Trinity Ball 2011, and once she plays her hit &ldquo;Do It Like A Dude&rdquo;, a song to which I have now (strangely) become quite attached, she will be keeping the majority of the drunken crowd entirely satisfied.\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/pOf3kYtwASo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h3>Glasser</h3>\nAs I&rsquo;ve previously stated, Glasser isn&rsquo;t an artist that I have a lot of past experience of listening to.\u00a0 When I searched for her in my iTunes, I came across a Delorean remix of her song &lsquo;Glad&rsquo;, which I managed to acquire by accident, as part of some complimentary playlist or other.\u00a0 Despite the track being quite good, and most definitely on a similar wavelength to many other bands I&rsquo;m rather fond of, it seems I hadn&rsquo;t bothered to amass any more of her work, that is, until I heard that she would be performing at our very own Trinity Ball in April.\u00a0 Without even a Wikipedia page to her name, New York-based Cameron Mesirow is daughter of Casey Cameron, founder of 70&rsquo;s Boston new-wave band &lsquo;Human Sexual Response&rsquo; (heard of them? me neither).\u00a0 Her experimental, electronic music, displaying a multitude of layered sounds, could be compared to that of\u00a0Bj\u00f6rk or Bat For Lashes, and is quite relaxed due to her angelic vocals, but also rather dense in places, a characteristic which can be attributed to the strict beats and bewitching synth.\u00a0 All in all, I think Glasser is another act that we can all look forward to at this year&rsquo;s Ball.\n<object height=\"225\" width=\"100%\"> <param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F136399\"></param> <param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param> <embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"225\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fplaylists%2F136399\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed> </object> <span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/youngturks/sets/yt037-glasser-tremel\">YT037 - Glasser - Tremel</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/youngturks\">Young Turks</a></span>", "Imageurl": "1500", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1494", "Heading": "TRINITY BALL 2011; So Far So Good."}
