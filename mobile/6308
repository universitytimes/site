I did a degree and had to pay for it myself, why shouldn't they?</blockquote>\n- Michael, retired.\n<blockquote>Not only should there not be a hike in fees, but fees should be abolished entirely.</blockquote>\n- Shane, Socialist Party.\n<blockquote>The way things are right now, if they raise the fees then I'm gone from this country.</blockquote>\n- Max, holding a 'Don't make me emigrate' placard.\n<blockquote>We need to keep education free s a right, not a privilege, and the wealthy people in society should be subjected to a progressive taxation to cover the costs of all public services. We can't afford to return to a place where education becomes the preserve of the elite.</blockquote>\n- Ruth, Marxist.\n<blockquote>You should do [protest] it every day. In fact, we all should be out with you.</blockquote>\n- Joanne, mother.\n<blockquote>The government are creating a form of apartheid. I'm marching against registration fees, not just fees.</blockquote>\n- Michael Shimaoka, student.\n<blockquote>I'm not really sure this march can make a difference but I really hope it can.</blockquote>\n- IT Carlow students.\n<blockquote>It's an impossible fight, but you Irish fought a rebellion in 1916 to give your people freedom and I think it's absolutely brilliant to see that spirit still alive. I have to be on a plane in an hour and a half but I really want to stay here and see this.</blockquote>\n- Lionel, tourist\n<blockquote>I think the role of Labour Youth is to constructively encourage the minister to come up with an alternative plan to balance his budget.</blockquote>\n- Chris Bond, Labour Councillor for Tallaght South\n<blockquote>'I support them, but they're wasting their time'</blockquote>\n- Mary, pensioner.\n<blockquote>We've still got plenty of universities in the top 200 in the world. We shouldn't look too much into these lists because they don't take everything into account.</blockquote>\n- Miche\u00e1l Martin, Fianna F\u00e1il leader.\n<blockquote>Here's a pledge for you - if you increase fees, we pledge never to vote for you again. Enjoy your five years in Leinster House because you're not coming back.</blockquote>\n- Gary Redmond, USI President.\n<blockquote>No.</blockquote>\n- all but one of the forty people asked 'do you have any sympathy for Minister Quinn's position?'", "Imageurl": "6357", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "6308", "Heading": "Word on the street: USI march"}
