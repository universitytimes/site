It's been a pleasure. I still maintain that half six is an unearthly hour to get up and watch a game of rugby. I implore you to go over to the irrepressible Cal Gray and Jack Leahy for the coverage of \u00a0South Africa V. Wales, which is bound to be a cracker. Somewhat of a fitting end to the game for the Americans, who looked the happier of the two sides after that final play try finished the game. We must not delude ourselves that this was a clash of two equal teams, where a 22-10 scoreline would be a fair score line. Ireland should have 'beaten them out the gate' as Conor O'Shea pointed out.

And a rash move from Stephen Ferris, who has thrown a punch, referee Craig Joubert decides not to take any action. Ireland with a scrum on the American five metre line, looking for the penalty try.

And\u00a0that's\u00a0a\u00a0surprise; American turn over in the scrum. unfortunate from an Irish perspective.</span></span>\n<strong style=\"color: #888888;\">70 Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Entering the final stages of the game, play has descended into a predictable chaotic mess again, some more big hits from the Americans, some more handling errors from both sides. Very poor standard of rugby on show.</span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">64 Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Both sides ringing the changes now, Shane Jennings has been replaced by Denis Leamy, Jerry Flannery has come on for Rory Best, Andrew Trimble comes on for Geordan Murphy, with Keith Earls going to full back, and the heaviest man in the tournament, Tony Buckley, has come on for Tom Court. Americans looking much more tired now and they bring on prop Mate Moeakiola for Mike Macdonald, and scrum-half Tim Usasz for Mike Petri.\u00a0Irish play has been much more \u00a0positive, vintage O'Gara kick to the corner. Ireland starting to turn the screw.</span></span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">59 Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Some of the Americans looking tired, and their out-half\u00a0Roland Suniula comes off with cramp, he was replaced by Nese Malifa. He had been holding up an Irish line-out where he was lying on the pitch. Straight from the line out, we go wide, Great hands from the back line and Bowe to O'Driscoll, who pops it back inside to <strong>Tommy Bowe. TRY</strong>. Good work. Much better conversion from O'Gara. <strong>Ireland 22-3 USA.</strong></span></span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">56 Minutes: </strong><span><span style=\"color: #888888;\">And\u00a0that's\u00a0not how you want to follow up your first points on the board, straight from the kick-off a sliced clearance from the Americans, Good line out and maul, and we peel away from the back. <strong>TRY</strong>. <strong>Rory Best</strong> at the back of the maul, good work from the forwards, and a more clinical attitude. From the touchline, O'Gara misses the conversion. <strong>Ireland 15-3 USA</strong>.\u00a0</span></span></span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">52 Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Good phase work from the Americans, working their way down to the Irish 22, penalty given away by Donncha O'Callaghan, and a shot at goal from Patterson, it's good. <strong>Ireland 10-3 USA</strong>.</span></span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">47 Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Continued pressure from Ireland, an update on our players coming back from injury is mixed; Stephen Ferris is probably our best player on the pitch at the moment. Tommy Bowe has been a mixed bag, took the try well, but open play has only been average from a man we expect so much from. Good American turnover, they have been competing in Irish rucks all day long. Conor Murray unfortunate to be judged on this performance, quality of ball at the base of the ruck has been awful. And he makes way for Eoin Reddan. O'Gara for Sexton switch is made too. Expect a more territory orientated style of play from the Irish.</span></span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">43 Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">First scrum of second half conforms to expectation, and Ireland awarded a very kickable penalty well inside American half, and Sexton misses again. Poor. A minute later, Tom Clever\u00a0penalized\u00a0for not rolling away, another penalty, about five metres inside American half, little bit more central than the previous one. Sexton misses again. One from five. Awful. Ronan O'Gara expected on very soon.</span></span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>40 Minutes: </strong>Changes expected in the Irish line-up in the next ten minutes according to the RTE commentators, we are told that Eoin Reddan, Ronan O'Gara and Andrew Trimble were warming up at half time. Back under way in Taranaki, and both the wind and the rain have died down for the moment.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>Half Time: </strong>And that try was the last action of the half, putting a bit of a gloss on the score-line that doesn't really reflect the performance. If we play like this against Australia, it will not end well. Some words of wisdom from George Hook; 'This American scrum is so bad, it's making Tom Court look like Arnold Schwarznegger.'</span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>38 Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Tom Court is simply obliterating the American scrum, turnover against the head just before half time, Ireland back in the 22, some half breaks, really important to get something on the board before half time. <strong>TRY</strong>. And there it is, you felt it was coming. Ireland go through the phases, better handling, the forwards recycle it well, wide to<strong> Tommy Bowe</strong>, who ghosts through the american midfield to tap down under the posts. Sexton adds the extras. <strong>Ireland 10-0 USA</strong>.</span></span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>35 Minutes: </strong>Handling errors continue to dominate the game, sustained possession proving difficult for both sides. Ireland really not looking sharp with ball in hand, the support runners staying too deep, and you feel they are too willing to kick it away after three or four phases.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>29 Minutes: </strong>Finally, some good play in the open from the Irish, who had been dominating at the set-piece throughout. Some half breaks from O'Driscoll and Earls and we find ourselves camped in the 22. The tackling from the Americans has been phenomenal so far. Flanker Tom Clever is thumping anything in green that moves.</span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">24 Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Worrying trends from Irish point of view, handling continues to be poor, Brian O'Driscoll is also not looking very sharp. Sustained period of pressure from the USA. Ireland content to play cautiously and let the\u00a0Americans\u00a0come at them.</span></span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">20: Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Surface becoming\u00a0noticeably\u00a0greasy as a result of all the rain. Some good USA possession leads to a penalty out on the touchline, first attempt for winger James Patterson, who pushes it wide right.\u00a0</span></span>\n<span><strong style=\"color: #888888;\">15: Minutes: </strong><span style=\"color: #888888;\">Clever little show and go from Conor Murray, and the Americans penalised at the ruck, Sexton with an easier kick this time, and he opens his account for the tournament. <strong>Ireland 3-0 USA.</strong></span></span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>11 Minutes: </strong>Another missed penalty from Sexton, he's connecting cleanly with it, accuracy will need to improve. Scratch what I said about the rain earlier, it's absolutely bucketing down. Ball goes back down the pitch and a clever little chip through by Mike Petri leads to a half chance for Ngwenya, but it bounces away from him.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>8 Minutes: </strong>Great possession and territory for the Irish so far, would be nice to convert it into points early. Some great tackling from the Americans pushes Ireland back to the the edge of the 22, leading to an audacious chip over the top by Sexton, but Bowe was off-side. Americans get to relieve the pressure.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>4 Minutes: </strong>First scrum goes rather convincingly in favor of the Irish, making ten metres in two seconds, penalty given, and, Sexton misses. This tournament may be known for the number of missed placed kicks than anything else. A quick break for Ireland with Earls coming in off his wing and taking a massive hit, he's a bit shook up but looks set to continue.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>1 Minute: </strong>South African referee Craig Joubert gets us underway, it will be interesting to see how he referees the game, already one of the\u00a0story-lines\u00a0of the tournament has been the contrast in refereeing at the breakdown between southern and northern hemisphere officials.</span>\n<span style=\"color: #888888;\"><strong>6:55\u00a0</strong>National anthems performed wonderfully, Star Spangled Banner was truly motivational, and now we are now moments away from kick off.

On the U.S.A. side, it would be remiss of me not to mention Trinity graduate Scott LaValla, who starts the game on the bench, and we hope to see him at some stage. Only four full time professionals in the American squad, the back row, and danger-man winger Ngwenya, who shot to fame after skinning then International Player of the Year, Bryan Habana, in the last world cup.
