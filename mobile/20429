{"Body": "<strong>Catherine O'Callaghan</strong> | Contributing Writer\r\n\r\nLeading global education provider Study Group has launched a new video to promote studying in Trinity and UCD for international students. The video highlights Trinity&rsquo;s reputation as Ireland&rsquo;s oldest university and stresses the diverse and friendly environments of both universities.\r\n\r\nStudy Group runs the International Study Centre in Dublin in partnership with TCD and UCD, a facility designed to raise awareness of the universities and attract international students. Trinity is one of 100 higher education institutions from across the world, working with Study Group to develop the college&rsquo;s international potential.\r\n\r\nStudy Group&rsquo;s promotional video encourages international students to come to Dublin by focusing on the exciting range of cultures to be found in the capital, an important selling point for a city that attracts approximately 60% of Ireland&rsquo;s international students.\r\n\r\nAt the innovative International Study Centre, completion of a foundation year gives international students whose school-leaving examination does not meet the requirements for direct entry to Trinity, the opportunity for undergraduate level entry. The foundation year also prepares students for Irish university life, helping them to successfully make the transition to their first year of undergraduate study.\r\n\r\nTrinity currently offers two routes; Business, Economics and Social Studies (BESS) or Science and Engineering, both of which open up a range of undergraduate degrees to choose from. College\u00a0has announced that it is now accepting applications for the next International Foundation Year starting in January 2014.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that Trinity&rsquo;s global reputation will be strengthened by this internationally focused partnership and that it will also benefit Dublin's economy.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/studygroup.png", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20429", "Heading": "Trinity Promoted in Video Geared Towards International Students"}
