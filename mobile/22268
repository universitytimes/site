Astronomy was, in effect, the first science. \u00a0Stonehenge was built purely to compute when the stars and planets were aligned for the celebration of the Solstices as astronomy also, conversely, played a major part in many different spiritual rituals and religious practices all over the world. \u00a0Even today, every time you read your horoscope, you subscribe to the belief that the alignment of various celestial bodies are in some way influencing and explaining your &lsquo;destiny&rsquo;.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fLeCYtCWwgmW_19i3k9fpM7itBRNADR8slzEj5UCFGn0b0AhAgP_NW2p5RZ4IA-CIFsLvYcyRiYcSDJqu9qP6rOk1jIyWiY8CU_4xj6ZhhjhGaAdv6guD8QpJ0vsBCBB2dA\" width=\"800\" height=\"440\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Humans&rsquo; insatiable desire to explain and understand drove thousands to devote their lives to the study of what Einstein described as \u00a0&ldquo;manifestations of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A comet is an icy body of the Solar System that displays a visible atmosphere and tail when it is affected by solar radiation and solar winds. \u00a0\u00a0Through the spectrometric study of the Ison Comet, astrochemists will be able to examine its chemical composition, gathering data that will help unravel the question of the formation of our 4.6 billion year old Solar System. \u00a0They will also look at its water content and if it posseses precursors to amino acids, the building blocks of life on earth, potentially explaining how life came to be on our planet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On average, only one comet can be seen without telescopic aid of some sort a year and of those approximately thirty in recorded history have been termed &lsquo;great comets&rsquo; meaning that they are bright enough to the causal observer who has not been actively seeking them at all.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<img title=\"The Ison Comet at sunrise last week\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kxhgcpQDICeszzhZxLNb__C7LKbMdpd8lrh4lBwibcUOteaCJfUoCwNR6JbBYKfgSUCBo6XcxqKgTMlWaOBNgliomwgoLwB_hiXeyhy_QHsMcwimwAMd0l67sc2h8kyCxS0\" width=\"600\" height=\"420\" /> The Ison Comet at sunrise last week[/caption]\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">In the next three weeks, we are being treated to not one but two of these great comets. \u00a0Get outside and look up.</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/image00.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22268", "Heading": "Look Up"}
