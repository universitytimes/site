The winners of the national competitions are invited to compete at the Enactus World Cup in Washington DC. In 2011, more than 33,000 attended these competitions worldwide.\n\nLeo Cullen admitted to voting for the Trinity team last year as a judge in the national competition. He also felt that being part of Enactus is a fantastic business opportunity as it is a &ldquo;chance to help other people while giving back at the same time&rdquo;.\n\nKarina Howley was also very proud of how well Trinity did in last year&rsquo;s national competition. She reminded students that when they are applying for jobs with &ldquo;2,000 CVs for the same job, if you see Enactus on the CV it makes you stand out from the crowd&rdquo;.\n\nLeader of TCD Enactus Arthur McKey and PR manager Adrian Clarke discussed some of the issues they encountered with the teams last year. One of the main difficulties was that a lot of students had signed up, but had failed to get involved. McKey felt that becoming involved with Enactus is a fantastic entrepreneurial opportunity to &ldquo;learn from the people that have done it&rdquo; and &ldquo;to create entrepreneurial action that will allow us to create positive change&rdquo;.\n\nFood Glorious Food, last year&rsquo;s runners up, Voice for the Voiceless and Ethnic Threads are among the teams that TCD students can get involved in. The teams are looking for students to be responsible for areas in accounting, marketing, operations and law.\n\nStudents that would be interested in getting involved should email their details to enactustcd@gmail.com.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VlDBscBYrE&amp;list=PLB70z7qMwmYaDpSMEOuM4P1lPiwiwQXtw&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plpp_video", "Imageurl": "12993", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12952", "Heading": "TCD Enactus launches in association with Trinity Enterpreneurial Society"}
