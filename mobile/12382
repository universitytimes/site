So many people were anecdotally reporting incredible financial expense in getting to Croke Park in support of their county team, but as a neutral I felt I could justify this expense just as easily; both sides had earned their place in the GAA showpiece, being their respective provincial champions, and arguably the two best teams in the Championship all year. As this fan waited with baited breath, the ceremony alleviated and the culmination of another season of football began.\n\nAnd we didn&rsquo;t have to wait long for the game to kickstart. Skilful Donegal centre-back Karl Lacey showed some impressive footwork and a drove a 30-metre pass to dynamic full-forward Michael Murphy. The powerful Murphy won the ball, turned his man and powered the ball into the centre of the Mayo net, to the delight of the Donegal fans on the Hill. An edgy Mayo team conceded a number of frees, incurring the wrath of Laois referee Maurice Deegan, and earning themselves a few yellow cards, and allowing Donegal to stretch a lead.\n\nAs Donegal sought control of the midfield, the favourites began to grow in confidence and outplay Mayo in all aspects. In fielding the ball well, the Northerners pushed forward attempting to put distance between themselves and their Connacht rivals. Ten minutes after their opening goal Paddy McBrearty struck the post with his left boot. The resultant deflection fell to Colm McFadden who slotted it low past Dave Clarke. Clarke was called into action only two minutes later, but this time he did enough to spare his blushes.\n\nMayo needed to burst into life, but were very lucky not to lose full-forward Cillian O&rsquo;Connor to red card for some handbag punches on a number of the Donegal back-line and a more ferocious jab to the ribs of Eamonn McGee; the referee chose only to book the Mayo man. Kevin McLoughlin registered the first score for Mayo, after 15 minutes, with a fine point sailing over from around 30 metres on the right.\n\nAs the half progressed, the sides levelled out in terms of performance. Perhaps it was just the perspective I held from the higher altitude of the Cusack Stand, but both sides began to find and possess a greater amount of space on the Croke Park pitch. In particular, the game was played in the wide areas between the 21 metre lines on the pitch, with Donegal&rsquo;s blanketing strategy effective in the first half. On many occasions the ball was snuffed out at the half back line by either side, as both sides gave their all in a match very much in the balance. Roving wing-forward Mark McHugh, a marked man before the game, was noted as being evidence of this blanketing technique. The Donegal man was playing around the middle with the likes of Kavanagh and Gallagher and the game was thoroughly energetic. He almost had a disastrous moment when a loose freekick almost played Mayo through on goal. Thankfully, goalie Paul Durcan was on hand to mop up.\n\nWhen Mayo did go on the attack Aidan O&rsquo;Shea led from the middle and Cillian O&rsquo;Connor kicked a number of frees to bring Mayo right back into the fixture. Colm McFadden was on form at the other end, finishing the half with 1-03 to his name. When the break came Mayo trailed by only 3 points, 2-04 to 0-07. The scoreline was a very fair representation, with Donegal&rsquo;s early lead reduced by some Mayo graft. Mayo opened the second half with the wind at their backs.\n\nBut it was Donegal who scored first in this half as well. McFadden of Donegal and O&rsquo;Connor of Mayo traded some early frees with neither side budging on the margin. But with another ten minutes passing in the match Mayo&rsquo;s fightback came to a standstill. The side that had battled back so well in the first half had hit a stumbling block, and was now doomed to repeat the luck which befell them at every recent All-Ireland Final. Again, the game showed great promise around the middle of the field, with both sides displaying deft touch, neat passing and hard hitting resilience in the face of stern opposition. But as Mayo burned out, Donegal&rsquo;s patient and cutting build-up gave them the edge, and the majority of the scores. With key men McFadden and Murphy totalling 1-04 each for the day Donegal notched up 7 points in the second half, while Mayo scored only 6; even at that, the gaps between some of Mayo&rsquo;s points were an inexcusable 10 minutes apart. In short, when they ran out of steam, Mayo were outplayed by a truly better team, and you can&rsquo;t say fairer than that. A fine Donegal side ran out deserved winners on the day that was, 2-11 to 0-13\n\nAs the favourites entering the ultimate encounter, Donegal more than justified their position as the dominant force in football this year. In just two years, Jim McGuinness has instilled a belief and tactic system which was heavily debated and questioned. However, for the doubting parties amount us (and I was one) Donegal have silenced their critics. They began as an ugly football team whose negative play was disliked by the GAA, and have turned a basic blanket defence into a work of art. Be it counter attacks or long ball to the unbelievable spearhead Michael Murphy, McGuinness masterpiece has taken shape. His players put in a good turn, and they are now rightfully rewarded: second All-Ireland Final, second Sam Maguire.", "Imageurl": "12383", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12382", "Heading": "Donegal Outclass Mayo for All-Ireland Title"}
