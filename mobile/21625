{"Body": "<strong>Antony Wolfe</strong> | Staff Writer\r\n\r\nAre you sick of playing 5-a-side football? Are you keen for a proper full-pitch championship to get the competitive juices flowing? Do you crave to lead your team to glory? The MegaLeague might be the answer to your prayers. The official MegaLeague website describes the competition as &ldquo;recreational but very competitive&rdquo; &ndash; similar to the English Premier League.\r\n\r\nThe MegaLeague is a social football league run by Trinity. Last year there were 20-odd teams in the league, which represents a paltry 3% of Trinity&rsquo;s student population. This writer is a former player for such renowned teams as Sporting Lisbon Treaty and Ghanarrhea FC. It is expected this article will encourage others to follow in the illustrious footsteps of the great players who have graced the hallowed fields of Santry Sports Grounds over the years.\r\n\r\nTeam names in the league showcase a creativity that is sadly not mirrored in the team playing styles. Teams such as CFR Clunge, Unreal Madrid and Dynamo Chicken Kiev have been illustrious opponents over the last few seasons. MegaLeague Commissioner Tommy Dunne has called for expansion teams to fill the void left by these now-graduated giants.\r\n\r\nThe MegaLeague is the lesser-known cousin of UCD&rsquo;s more popular SuperLeague. A key factor is the scarcity of football pitches on Trinity&rsquo;s main campus. Therefore matches take place in Santry Sports Grounds and the distance required in travelling to Santry on weekend mornings is seen as a deterrent by even the most ardent footballer. It is a strange fact that the Santry Sports Grounds enjoy a tundra climate despite being located just a few kilometres north of Trinity&rsquo;s campus.\r\n<blockquote>Teams such as CFR Clunge, Unreal Madrid and Dynamo Chicken Kiev have been illustrious opponents over the last few seasons.</blockquote>\r\nAll teams covet the honour and the glory of playing the Megaleague Cup Final in front of the Pav in April. That match is traditionally held on Trinity Thursday and is broadcast live on Sky Sports as part of their coverage of Tiki-Taka Trinity Thursday.\r\n\r\nMy teams never managed to make it to the MegaLeague Cup Final. It could have all been different if our former star striker could have finished off chances on the pitch in the same way he finished off cans in the Pav. Extensive scouting missions to far-flung destinations, such as Tipperary, were carried out but no suitable replacements could be found.\r\n\r\nIf you have played 11-a-side football for clubs or school teams in the past, you may be pleasantly surprised at the zen-like approach to preparation in the MegaLeague. Actual football training is frowned upon and has been described by former teammates as &ldquo;cheating&rdquo;. Teams rumoured to have trained are derided for being contrary to the spirit of the MegaLeague.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that there is a lack of a will to win. The famous Liverpool manager Bill Shankly once stated: &ldquo;Some people believe football is a matter of life or death &ndash; it is much, much more important than that&rdquo;. The MegaLeague is built on these foundations.\r\n\r\nMegaLeague Commissioner Tommy Dunne is available on 086-3856726 &ndash; call today to set up your team and receive a free football history lesson. On weekend mornings, all roads lead to the MegaLeague matches that offer an opportunity for glory. The mere act of trekking the long slog to Santry on a weekend morning shows the desire, passion and commitment of the players. While the wages are not on the same level as the Premier League, the win bonus of a post-match team meal in the Santry McDonalds down the road is one of the best rewards that can be offered.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-shot-2013-11-07-at-14.59.26.png", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21625", "Heading": "The Rocky Road to Santry"}
