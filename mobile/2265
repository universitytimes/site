{"Body": "Aoife Considine-\n\nSo this week I set out again to try and quash that old wonted tale that the ABKs (Arts Block Kids) are eons ahead in the style stakes compared to us poor sweat pant donning Hamilton heads. Being in the library last Tuesday, but not studying as usual, I decided I may as well start my hunt down the Hamilton end and make good use of my time that clearly was not going to be spent learning about solids and structures. Luckily enough for me, I happened upon a gaggle of Senior Freshman Scientists all huddled around tables collecting leaflets about their next years subject choices and soon enough I&rsquo;d found my Hamilton guy and girl of the week, albeit with a bit of persuasion from their mates and a few &ldquo;ah go on, we swear we won&rsquo;t make fun of you&hellip;&hellip;. lol, jk, we&rsquo;re definitely posting this to all the girls/guys you&rsquo;ve ever scored&rdquo; words of encouragement.\n\nThe Arts Block however was a different kettle of fish altogether. I&rsquo;m not too sure whether Tuesday is national ABK don&rsquo;t go to college day, but the place was dead; no brightly coloured cardigans flashed past my ogling eyes, no boys painted into their trousers, no glass-less glasses, no undercuts and not a fedora in sight! I was flabbergasted! I found out later, courtesy of the ABK I live with that they were all in the library. I choose not to comment on this, as I fear it is the intelligent choice regarding my personal safety so I think I&rsquo;ll move on. I did eventually however find two pretty stylish Business kids chilling out on the couches that I think are a fresh change from the typical hipster image the Arts Block prevails.\n\nMaybe next week I won&rsquo;t visit the Arts Block on a Tuesday.\n<h2><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Hamilton</span>:\n\n<a
