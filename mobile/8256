Although there were swift regime changes in Egypt and Tunisia, the future of these two North African states is still undecided. There is constant talk of the possibility a new form of democracy taking hold in these countries. While the idea of a new democratic system separate from the western ideology does not terrify many, there is a growing political and religious force in these countries which is causing some to question whether or not the Arab Spring was the best step forward.\n\nThe Salafis are an orthodox Islamic group who practice a rigid following of the Qur&rsquo;an. Having previously stayed out of the spotlight under the now departed autocratic rulers, the Salifis have recently been making waves in the recent fair and free elections. Most recently in Egypt the Salifi&rsquo;s political wing Al Nour<em> </em>gained a 29% share of the vote for parliament, putting them in second place at the polls. This is was a surprising result as it seemed that the majority of the population had turned from the secular youths credited with the outbreak of the protests last year.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Who are the Salafis?</strong></span>\n\nThe question posed by many is a difficult one to answer, on the surface the Salafis are a sect of Muslims who strictly adhere to principles and guidelines set down in the Qu&rsquo;ran, the Sunna and the Hadith. Their rigidity of following the rules within these scriptures could be compared with the ultra-Orthodox Jews of Israel. However this is a broad sweeping explanation and is unsatisfactory for any in-depth analysis of their recent appearance in the global media. Salafism is in its essence a collective term for many different groups of believers who share similar ideology but vary hugely on their actions and goals. While all Salafi follow the Qu&rsquo;ran, Sunna and Hadith as closely as possible and don&rsquo;t believe that these teachings are metaphorical in any way, after that they differ. Each group of Salafism follow the teachings of the Hadith most closely as they believe these scriptures as the most applicable to the modern world. However there is no generally accepted view within Salafism of which Hadith applies to today&rsquo;s modern world therefore it is their view of the world around them which cause them to have differing goals and take varying actions. One example is that some extreme sects within Salafism, including members of Al Qaeda, believe that the world of today is comparable to the Mongol period. They therefore follow the teaching of the hadith at that time, accepting civilians who contrive with the enemy as legitimate targets.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Role in the Revolutions</strong></span>\n\nIn the case of Egypt the main organisation of Salafi faithful, Ansar al-Sunna originally denounced the revolution on the basis that suicide is <em>haram </em>(a sin). The Arab Spring which began in Tunisia started with the self-immolation of a college graduate, this trend continued across the other arab states. In Egypt it was Abdu &lsquo;Abd al Munam Hamada, a restaurant owner, who self-immolated. While Ansar al-Sunna could not be considered a friend of the regime of Mubarak, it kept a low status and denounced opposing the system. Rather during the time of Mubarak&rsquo;s autocratic rule al-Sunna placed the emphasis on following their teachings at home and with family. Ansar al-Sunna was also concerned that the revolution was for &ldquo;bread not religion&rdquo; and although the theory of <em>jihad</em> has much support within their group, both in its peaceful and violent forms, the revolution was not deemed to be a case of <em>jihad</em>.\n\nIn contrast to Ansar al-Sunna, the Qutbists, the other sect of salafism in Egypt, spoke out and were invited to mosques where they were usually not welcome. They encouraged the working class youth to participate in the revolution, while not announcing it as a <em>jihad,</em> most fully supported its cause. The Qutbist Salafis are often accepted as the most radical of the Salafi sects in Egypt, insofar as they emphasize the glory of armed <em>Jihad. </em>For obvious reasons it is sects like this which western commentators fear gaining control of the Arab Spring countries. While the radical Salafis are in a minority within these evolving states they are a growing voice and gaining much media attention.\n\n<span style=\"color: #993366;\"><strong>Present day and the role of the Salafi</strong></span>\n\nIn only one country have the Salafi gained a significant portion of the vote. In Egypt as stated above they received one fifth of the electorate&rsquo;s votes through the newly formed Al Nour party. It is unclear how many of the members of this party are of a radical disposition on <em>jihadi </em>views, however it is near impossible that they will make an impact on the overall moderate view of the forming government. It is not only in politics that they have gained media coverage.\n\nMost recently the Salafi have appeared in the news in a negative light. The broadcast of <em>Persepolis </em>on Tunisian national TV caused outcry amongst many conservative Muslims in the state. However it was a Salafi mob who attacked the head of the television director after his trial. Salafi sects have also become violent in their enforcement of Sharia law. On case being, a Libyan refugee who&rsquo;s makeshift shop was ransacked for selling alcohol. Cases of violent reprimand for breaking Sharia law are becoming increasingly common in these countries which had previously been quite stable, albeit under despotic rulers. In Egypt and Tunisia, there have been numerous reports of the destructive of icons and shrines of saints. The Salafi believe this is a form of pagan ritual and must be eliminated from Islam. This declaration of Sharia law when it has yet to be declared by the government \u00a0is worrying to many residents both Muslim and secular.\n\nThis violent tone is also what worries many commentators, by exhibiting violence against other practicing Muslims uncertainties are being raised about the Salafis future role in government. If they obtain a decisive role in government, their plans for the imposition of their form of Sharia Law are unclear. The level of authority required to enforce these laws would be on autocratic levels, a step backward from the Arab Spring.", "Imageurl": "8257", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "8256", "Heading": "Salafism Explained"}
