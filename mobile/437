{"Body": "<p>Dirt birds. Absolute dirt birds. That&rsquo;s what I said last week when I heard that soccer players in the UK had to be warned that spitting on pitches was being discouraged because it may spread swine flu. If they listened to my granny they&rsquo;d stop not just because of the viral repercussions but also because it&rsquo;s a filthy habit. &lsquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t spit,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s disgusting.&rsquo; Then again if we listened to her rugby matches would just consist of the national anthems being played and then Ronan O&rsquo;Gara doing drop goals for half an hour. She&rsquo;d love that. <br />One thing GAA always missed out on was the anthems thing. I guessed they&rsquo;d just play &lsquo;Amhr&aacute;n na bhFiann&rsquo; twice. Let&rsquo;s be honest here, there&rsquo;s not a hope in hell of them playing &lsquo;Ireland&rsquo;s Call&rsquo; or &lsquo;that Protestant song&rsquo; as it&rsquo;s generally referred to. Either that or they could play the county anthems. I don&rsquo;t think the crowds are ready could sit through the 23 verses of &lsquo;Oh Cork&rsquo; again. Never mind the Dublin anthem, which reached number 3 for DJ Spiral in 2006.</p>\n<p>I remember back in my sporting youth, I played hurling (different from men&rsquo;s camogie, get it right) and I was pretty great. I remember one time I scored a goal against my coach and I was really proud. His hurl was broken at the top but I still think I did a good job.

My cousins Christopher McGinnity and Stephen McGinnity play for the team, they&rsquo;re great. At the last match I went to Christopher was number 13, but it wasn&rsquo;t unlucky! Ha ha ha! They won the match because they had twice as many points. Well done lads, win it for the &lsquo;bay! That was a great day.

I did a quiz hosted by my old teacher in my local GAA club last month and it was all on things he&rsquo;d taught me as a child but it appears my brain has decided it doesn&rsquo;t care what city the River Boyne flows through. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;ll wake up beside a river and the only signposting in the area will be a sign that says &lsquo;River Barrow&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll be like &lsquo;noooooo!

I think table quizzes should be in the olympics. It&rsquo;d be like &lsquo;Who wants to be a Millonaire&rsquo; multiplied by &lsquo;Mastermind&rsquo; plus national anthems.
