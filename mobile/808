The political observers took this as a sign that the Taoiseach was to make an announcement about his position as leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">There has been talk in Fianna F&aacute;il circles of a possible heave for months, but it appears that neither of the potential candidates, Brian Lenihan and Micheal Martin, have made a move as of yet, due to uncertainty as to whether they would have enough votes to get them over the line.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">A well-placed source within Fianna F&aacute;il shed some light on a possible cause of the media furore. It appears that on the weekend of the January 1st there was a meeting between a number of Lenihan supporters. They decided that with the election looming, and the almost certain decimation Fianna F&aacute;il is facing, the only hope of salvaging a decent result election would be if Cowen was deposed as leader and a new leader put in place.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">It was decided to arrange a larger meeting of Lenihan supporters, to be held on January 12th. Provisional bookings were placed on two conference rooms, one in Buswells Hotel for 30 people and one in The Shelbourne for 100 people. It was expected supporters of Lenihan, from Councillors, TD&rsquo;s, National Executive Members and other disgruntled party members would attend, and a strategy for the removal of Cowen could be put in place&nbsp;and to assess if he had enough votes to support his run for leadership.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">However, this planned meeting never took place. It was decided on Sunday January 9th by the prospective organisers that, in light of the publication of Sean FitzPatrick&rsquo;s interview, and the disdain over &lsquo;Golfgate&rsquo; that Mr Cowen&rsquo;s position was compromised enough and that he would not require too much further pushing.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">The provisional booking of the rooms was cancelled and the meeting never went ahead.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">It appears however that a pro-Cowen government Minister got wind of the cancelled meeting in the D&aacute;il Bar. However, the Minister did't hear that the meeting was cancelled, only that there had been one planned. He rushed to inform Mr. Cowen of the plan, and somehow the media got wind of the planned meeting. The planned meeting, combined with Mr Cowen&rsquo;s further revelations about &lsquo;Golfgate&rsquo; during Leaders questions in the D&aacute;il on the January 12th, spun the rumour mills into overdrive, with behind the scenes whispers that Mr Cowen&rsquo;s time as leader was short. With the announcement that the meeting was to be postponed until 3pm, the ever hasty media, jumped to the conclusion that Mr Cowen was about to resign.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">The airwaves were filled with buzz of it, Liveline had callers predicting the next leader and talking about Mr Cowen&rsquo;s leadership in the past tense and various analysts were speaking of the difficulties facing Finna F&aacute;il if Mr Cowen remained on as Taoiseach but not leader of the party or if he resigned both positions. They spoke as if it was a foregone conclusion that Mr Cowen&rsquo;s leadership would not survive much beyond 3pm. Their talk was pre-emptive.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">Backbenchers, and members of the Cabinet, were left in the dark all morning. No one knew what was happening, with some even asking members of the media if they knew what the situation was. No one, be they in the anti-Cowen or pro-Cowen camp, was quite sure as to what would happen at the Parliamentary meeting. After the meeting it was remarked by one member in attendance that no one knew what to do, they were all sitting there waiting for someone else to make a move, but no one did.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; text-align: left; line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0px;\">The issue was swiftly addressed by Mr. Cowen and he made it clear, that he would not be resigning any time soon.
