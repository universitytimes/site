Tries from Ben\nAlexander , Adam Ashley-Cooper, James O&rsquo;Connor and Digby Ioane helped\nRobbie Deans&rsquo; side to a 32-6 victory against a pugnacious Italian side.\n\nComing off the back of a Tri-Nations victory, and sporting an irrepressible\nQueensland Reds-flavoured backline, the winners of the Super 15 this year,\none would be a brave soul to bet against Australia running away with this one,\nespecially considering Italy&rsquo;s difficulty in scoring tries in recent matches.\n\nAs an analyst, this looked like an open-and-shut case, with Italy trying to slow\nthe tempo down, play for territory and limit the potent Aussie backline to few\nopportunities. Italy, evidently, hadn&rsquo;t read the script.\n\nThe game started in a flurry of penalties, turnovers, and counter-attacking\nwith both scrumhalves attempting several tap penalties to keep the opposition\ndefenses guessing. After flirting with a high tempo, and an active Alain Roland\nwhistle, the Italian pack started to take more control of the game. They squeezed\u00a0the Wallabies&rsquo; set piece, and with halfbacks Orquera and Semenzato playing for\u00a0territory they limited Quade Cooper and co. to few opportunities.\n\nThe Italian defence came up very quickly and very strong for most of the first\nhalf, something which Aussie outhalf Cooper proved in the past he does not like.\nThe tenacious Italian defence continued to hammer the Wallaby backs, resulting\nin a lack of gainline possession, leaving Cooper and fullback Kurtley Beale\nplaying into Italy&rsquo;s hands and fighting for territory.\n\nAlthough the Aussie scrum looked questionable at best for the most part,\nsomething which Italian coach Nick Mallet would have targeted prior to kickoff,\u00a0there was an overwhelming feeling that the Italian defence would tire, and this\ndangerous Aussie backline would begin to click.\n\nFollowing a Mirco Bergomasco missed penalty, the athletic Australian pack\nbegan to dominate proceedings, with Radike Samo, James Horwill, and Rocky\nElsom combining to give Quade Cooper two penalty opportunities, which he\ncomfortably slotted to give Australia a 6-0 lead after half an hour.\n\nItaly clawed their way back into the game however and due to some fantastic\ncontinuity and ball recycling, managed to nab two penalties in the last ten\nminutes to level the scoreboard going into the second half.\n\nThe second half continued where the first left off; with the Italian pack slowing\nthe ball down considerably and their defence tackling relentlessly, with blindside\u00a0Alessandro Zanni leading the charge. Enter James O&rsquo;Connor for Anthony Faingaa\u00a0on 47 minutes, which turned out to be the key turning point in the game.\n\nStraight away, there was a spring in the step of the Aussies, and all of a sudden\u00a0there&rsquo;s an extra option for Cooper and scrum-half Genia at every turn. There&rsquo;s too much speed, power and direction for the Italian defence.\u00a0Ben Alexander crashed over after some beautiful handling skills, and\u00a0organisational play from Cooper. James O&rsquo;Connor gave the Aussies more\ngain line possession; allowing more time for Cooper, from which he can be\ndevastating.\n\nFive minutes later, Cooper sends Adam Ashley-Cooper under the\nposts after more fantastic build up play for James O&rsquo;Connor. The 22 year-old\nslotted the extras to stretch the lead to 18-6, and Italy had no response for the\nAustralian annihilation.\n\nO&rsquo;Connor scrambled over for another before the hour mark, completeing\nthe third- quarter blowout for the Wallabies, who now led 25-6. The Italians\nwouldn&rsquo;t be the same team chasing the game, and began to take more risks,\nallowing Kurtley Beale and Digby Ioane to showcase their talents.\n\nAustralia capped off a ruthless second half performance with the try of the\ntournament so far, as Ioane beat three defenders and slid under the posts off a\nscrum and another perfectly timed inside ball from Cooper.\n\nAfter attaining the bonus point, and a comfortable 32-6 lead, the Australians\nshutout the Italians, using their blinding back-row speed and continuity, and\nthey saw out the victory with consummate style and precision.\n\nQuestions answered for Robbie Deans include a resounding yes for whether or\nnot James O&rsquo;Connor should be allowed to start after his misconduct prior to the\nWorld Cup, and a resounding maybe over whether the Wallabies&rsquo; scrum is up to\nthe standard.\n\nA standout performance from the Aussie bench leaves Deans with a\u00a0nice dilemma in the already heated competition for Aussie places. Scott\nHigginbottom, Luke Burgess and James Slipper all made noteworthy\ncontributions.\n\nItaly shouldn&rsquo;t be disheartened with the landslide result, because for 50 minutes,\u00a0they were in the game, but they didn&rsquo;t have enough to cope with the force of\u00a0the Wallaby attack. They probably won&rsquo;t be the only team that falls short of the\u00a0Australian flair this year - they will test any team they come across.\n\nFrom an Irish perspective, it was thoroughly intimidating to see not just the\nspeed and precision of the Aussie attack, but also the ferocity if their tackling, the\u00a0commitment level of their pursuits. Not to mention their unparalleled strength\u00a0in depth. Their scalp will be the most coveted this autumn, and they \u00a0have impressed\u00a0more so than any other team in the opening fixtures so far.", "Imageurl": "4232", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4231", "Heading": "Golden boys shine through for Australia"}
