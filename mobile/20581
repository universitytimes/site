At a recent meeting, the College Finance Committee agreed to the proposed increases in non-EU tuition fees. In considering the financial effects of the proposals, members highlighted the positive impact of the increased fee levels on Trinity&rsquo;s finances. The Committee also highlighted the fact that this will be the first increase in fee levels for non-EU students since 2009-10. Following the agreement of the Committee, the Board of the College subsequently approved the decision earlier this month.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">College representatives have defended the fee increases and are confident that the move will not have a negative impact on Trinity&rsquo;s Global Relations Strategy. The Global Relations Strategy seeks to support and develop &ldquo;Trinity&rsquo;s global reputation as a leading university&rdquo;, with a focus on internationalisation, building partnerships between Trinity and educational institutions around the world and attracting non-EU students to the college.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Students&rsquo; Union President Tom Lenihan has commented on the decision to increase tuition fees for Non-EU students, noting that \"it is a step taken not unlike what Trinity's counterparts have done.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Given the initial success of the Global Relation Strategy the risk level that this would deter potential international students is low. It actually reflects how attractive Trinity is with our expanding international community,\" he continued.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trinity has recently conducted a student survey in relation to current non-EU fee levels. The findings of the survey indicate that fee levels were not the most important consideration for non-EU students. A statement on behalf of College asserts that: &ldquo;Monetary factors were not strong influencers of the decision to come to Trinity while reputation of both Trinity and the chosen course was. Tuition fees and cost of living came sixth and eighth respectively out of a list of ten factors influencing study at Trinity.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">College is confident that the increase in non-EU fee levels is in line with Trinity&rsquo;s counterparts, stating that &ldquo;comparative analyses were undertaken which benchmarked our fees with peer institutions. Based on the survey results, the comparative analysis and the fact that there has been no increase of fees in the past four years since 2009/10, College has decided to increase the non-EU fee levels for postgraduate and undergraduate courses.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The annual undergraduate tuition fees for non-EU students studying at Trinity College are currently &euro;15,950 for courses such as Law, Psychology or Two Subject Moderatorship while fees for Engineering or Mathematics stand at &euro;20,900, for example.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Trinity&rsquo;s Finance Committee and the Board of the College have approved the decision to increase non-EU fees, the details of the new fee levels have yet to be announced.</p>", "Imageurl": "http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/tcdglobal.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20581", "Heading": "Trinity Set to Increase Fees for Non-EU Students from 2014"}
