{"Body": "Despite hosting the tournament for the first time since 1992, home advantage proved irrelevant as Trinity were knocked out of the annual intervarsity tournament.\n\nTrinity produced a brave display against a physically and technically superior University of Ulster (Jordanstown) team as the match finished 2-0.\u00a0Yet, it\u00a0now stands at a\u00a0saddening 32 years since DUAFC last won the prestigious tournament.\n\nPlayed in front of a large crowd which had gathered at College Park, the game was a scrappy affair, lacking the expected quality which epitomises this tournament. \u00a0\u00a0Trinity started the game brightly however, largely thanks to their first round bye. \u00a0In contrast, UUJ, who had comprehensively beaten Queens Belfast 3-0 the previous day, looked somewhat lethargic.\n\nApplying early pressure on the UUJ defence, Trinity wasted several half chances as their forwards caused havoc in the opposition defence. \u00a0UUJ, boasting several Northern Irish league players, soon rediscovered their form. \u00a0As both teams searched for the best passing form, on a pitch that was not conducive to a free flowing passing style, UUJ had the first clear sight of goal after 20 minutes. \u00a0Jennings, a constant menace throughout was unable to convert from 6 yards out.\n\nHowever, 10 minutes later, he was rewarded for his endeavours when he neatly finished from an excellent ball into the box by Anderson.\u00a0\u00a0UUJ were in the ascendancy, controlling the midfield and peppering the Trinity goal with long-range shots.\n\nAt half time, the players and fans were graced by the presence of the famous Trinity Cat.\u00a0\u00a0However, not even Trinny was able to inspire the Trinity team;\u00a0\u00a0despite a succession of corners, they were unable to test the UUJ goalkeeper. \u00a0On 52 minutes, the visitors almost added a second, when Anderson&rsquo;s long range effort sailed narrowly wide of the post, having ghosted past the Trinity defense.\n\nAs tempers frayed and tackles became ever more aggressive, the game became a gruelling battle of attrition. \u00a0On 60 minutes, Trinity&rsquo;s keeper pulled off a smart save from Hutchinson, who showed glimpses of great promise.\n\nAs Trinity pushed for an equaliser, UUJ broke away. \u00a0The defense was split by a wonderful ball from Nathan Khan and they were punished by James Doherty with a clinical finish past home keeper O&rsquo;Carroll on 74 minutes. \u00a0Despite their determination and commendable attitude, Trinity were unable to impose themselves on the game and it finished 2-0.\n\nTrinity manager Terry McAuley was rightly proud of his player&rsquo;s performance and optimistic that his team could make an impression upon the Subsidiary Cup, for which they will now compete. \u00a0&lsquo;It was a tight game, against a strong UUJ team but I believe we gave it our best. \u00a0It was always very close but when they took the lead, we were chasing the game. \u00a0As you saw, we had numerous corners and free-kicks around the box, but unfortunately we were unable to take our chances. \u00a0\u00a0UUJ were well organised, defensively strong and ultimately had better players. \u00a0The lads gave a good account of themselves and we will pick ourselves up and look forward to tomorrow&rsquo;s match.&rsquo;\n\nJordanstown will not, however, contest the final after they were beaten 2-1 by NUI Galway in Santry. NUI will face University College Cork following the latter's victory over\u00a0holders UCD by the same scoreline.\u00a0Trinity, on the other hand, will regroup, reorganise and look forward to next year.\n\n<em><strong>COLLINGWOOD CUP FINAL: NUI GALWAY v UCC. 2:30PM, COLLEGE PARK, THURSDAY 24th FEBRUARY</strong></em>\nAlex Sloan", "Imageurl": "1829", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1819", "Heading": "DUAFC suffer Collingwood Cup heartbreak"}
