{"Body": "<p>Before the start of the 2010 World Cup qualifying the Republic of Ireland soccer team was at quite possibly its lowest ebb for many a decade. Embarrassed 5-2 against Cyprus in Nicosia and a manager who was made a complete and utter laughing stock of amongst the general public, no thought of what had gone before the 102 caps won for his country forget about the unstinting service he had given to his country over his international career that didn&rsquo;t seem to matter anymore all that mattered is the state of the Irish soccer team was s**t to say the least.</p>\n<p>Fast forward 18 months Steve Staunton is trying to re-build his managerial reputation with Darlington in the bottom tier of English football and Ireland has a new savior, an Italian no less, Giovanni Trapattoni has transformed this Irish team into a side capable of grinding out results of getting the job done with what limited resources he has available to him. Despite what was said by particular pundits regarding the sides performance against Italy in Croke Park a few weeks back the truth lies in the fact that when the draw was made with us as 3rd seeds against the current World Champions and a very talented Bulgarian side we would have taken a playoff place pure and simple.</p>\n<p>This side has dragged itself up from the bottom and become a team to be feared. Were it not for that ridiculous &lsquo;&rsquo;seeding&rsquo;&rsquo; system introduced at the last minute Ireland would quite possibly be in a much better situation than they currently find themselves in. Instead through FIFA&rsquo;s shameful attempt to ensure that all the games brightest stars attend the greatest sporting spectacle on Earth teams like Ireland who have worked hard have been given the short straw and have to continue to fight an uphill battle to get to the World Cup.</p>\n<p>All is not lost we may be drawn against a French team packed to the rafters with world class talent the names Thierry Henry, Karim Benzema and Nicholas Anelka are just some of those who would strike fear into many an opposing team. The fact of the matter is that we have no need to fear this French side; this team simply isn&rsquo;t working off the same hymn sheet and there seems to a distinct lack of respect for the much maligned Raymond Domenech as manager. Certainly if this game was to just be about talent and nothing more then the French would win time and time again but, like every sport, the most important aspect is not necessarily talent itself but drive ambition and work ethic which this Irish team has in spades. They are the reasons why Glenn Whelan and Keith Andrews can mix it with the likes of Pirlo and De Rossi because despite not being the most talented midfielders ever to pull on the green shirt their work ethic is unparalleled for 90minutes time and time again.</p>\n<p>Trapattoni despite all he has achieved in his relatively short time as Ireland manager as well as having no background in the Irish game has taken his &lsquo;&rsquo;fair share of stick&rsquo;&rsquo; from the media regarding his sometimes strange selection choices. He so far has been unable to entice Stephen Ireland back to the international fold and for reasons known only to himself, he has chosen to ignore the growing calls for the re-inclusion of Andy Reid. However despite his continued exclusion of Reid who is quite possibly the most creative player at his disposal Trapattoni has continued to ensure his team grind out the results when they really matter. Over the next 180 minutes of football to be played on the 14th and 18th of November we shall see whether he truly is our footballing messiah or yet another nearly man.</p>\n<p>As I write this article the squad for those crucial matches has been announced and yet again the growing calls for the talented Sunderland playmaker have fallen on deaf ears and Andy Reid will have to cheer on his country from the comfort of his home in England&rsquo;s North East. Even more surprising is the omission of the Sunderland mans namesake Stephen Reid whose powerful play from midfield would be something of great use against this talented French side.<br />However the simple fact of the matter is every Joe Soap who knows little or nothing about the sport has an opinion on whom they think should don the green jersey come the 14th but when it comes down to it our opinions mean nothing. Whether I feel one or both Reids should be included or whether everything should be done to entice Stephen Ireland back is simply irrelevant. Trapattoni is the man who calls the shots and the man has done soccer in this country a monumentous favour and restored pride to the national side and its time we put our trust in him. Because despite all the criticism, the questioning and the snide remarks we ended the qualifying campaign undefeated, we have the best opportunity to qualify for a major tournament we have had for many years. Two years ago we would have bitten FIFA&rsquo;s hand off for the opportunity we now find ourselves with. The job may not be done but we are getting there.</p>", "Imageurl": "<p>Before the start of the 2010 World Cup qualifying the Republic of Ireland soccer team was at quite possibly its lowest ebb for many a decade.
