The extension follows a deluge of applications preceding the initial deadline of Midnight August 1st overwhelming the system and causing a crash. Thousands of students were unable to lodge their grant application leading to more criticism of the Student Universal Support Ireland (SUSI) computer system.\n\nThe IT crash came just hours after Education Minister Ruair\u00ed Quinn vowed that SUSI would perform better for the coming academic term.\u00a0SUSI is especially keen to be\u00a0seen as doing right by students following the intense controversy surrounding it\u00a0during the last academic year when almost 20,000 students did not receive their grant\u00a0until the new year and a further 2,200 were still waiting as term ended.\n\nSpeaking at Student Union Training in Waterford IT on July 16th, John Conroy, Head of Communications for SUSI, told the incoming officers that all the problems with the system had been dealt with for this coming academic year. He ensured students that there would be no more systematic problems and that the applications should be processed in full by January 2014.\n\nAlan Murphy, head of operations with SUSI, said the system was out of action for less than two hours. \"It was a very brief outage due to congestion and was quickly fixed,\" he added. SUSI stated this morning that the website is now\u00a0operating normally and that no student data was lost or compromised during the\u00a0crash, which caused the website to be out of operation for over two hours between\u00a07pm and 9pm.\u00a0SUSI initially extended the deadline to Midday today but further extended it this\u00a0morning to ensure that no students were left behind.\n\nSUSI now encourages students to send their applications in as quickly as possible and\u00a0says it aims to have all grants paid by the end of October 2013.", "Imageurl": "http://ohjann.tfa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/susi-390x285.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/susi", "ID": "17110", "Heading": "Grant Deadline Extended as SUSI Website Crashes"}
