One Thursday three long years ago I made my way to the Earl of Kildare hotel, for the elections result night. As a candidate for the position of Welfare Officer, my next year, my life, my legacy, had the potential to drastically change in a few hours&rsquo; time. I was quietly confident &ndash; I&rsquo;d managed to vote for myself twice, and knew that my rivals, assuming that they weren&rsquo;t as good at voting as me, would only have voted for themselves once, which gave me a 100% lead. I was also confident of getting a few extra looks-based votes &ndash; I&rsquo;d give myself a solid 7 out of 10 for looks (7.5 if I&rsquo;ve had a few; 8 at a push if I&rsquo;ve been Viagra-ed, and I&rsquo;m in a particularly good mood) and expected to pick up some of the &lsquo;this one&rsquo;s attractive, I&rsquo;ll vote for him&rsquo; votes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Against that, I was conscious that one of my rivals was a whole point better looking, and I had recently received the shattering news that the girl who I was at that time seeing, while I had sex with her, had only given me her third preference vote. Plus, my hustings hadn&rsquo;t gone to plan (I almost came to blows with a girl at one, and at another a fake blood-filled condom which was concealed under my shirt failed to implode as planned, leading to considerable embarrassment), and at the previous nights&rsquo; Slave Auction I had accidentally tucked my penis between my legs before exposing it (for charity I hasten to add), which led to me sporting what could only be described as a &lsquo;mangina&rsquo;. No one wants to vote for a man with a fanny who has unimploded condoms hidden down his shirt. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>I was on edge &ndash; would Lady Luck shine on me that crisp February night?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As it turned out, no, she wouldn&rsquo;t. Not only had my soon-to-be-girlfriend not voted for me, most of my friends hadn&rsquo;t either. I ended up being narrowly pipped to fourth place by RON, or &lsquo;Re-Open Nominations&rsquo;, who isn&rsquo;t even a real person, and I got less than a tenth of the votes the winner got. My night reached its nadir when, as I was standing on a chair watching the Welfare votes being sorted into piles for each of the candidates, I realized that I probably wasn&rsquo;t going to win. As I digested this bombshell, the girl standing beside me turned and enquired whether I was wearing mascara. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is a fairly common occurrence for me- I happen to be blessed with particularly full-bodied, luscious eyelashes, and am frequently accused of wearing mascara. However, this would have to be the one occasion where I actually was wearing mascara, which was applied (as a joke) by a female friend earlier in the day. I felt humiliated, and quickly left before the girl beside me noticed that I was also sporting blusher.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, to all this year&rsquo;s candidates &ndash; if you do end up losing, at least console yourself with the fact that you haven&rsquo;t lost wearing make-up (unless you&rsquo;re wearing some for the laugh, or you&rsquo;re a tranny, or you&rsquo;re a girl). If you have lost wearing make-up, at least you didn&rsquo;t lose with several people thinking you have a fanny (unless you&rsquo;re a proper tranny, or a girl). If you have lost with people thinking you have a fanny, at least you haven&rsquo;t lost with an unexploded bit of rubber up your top (unless you&rsquo;re a girl). And, if you are a girl and you&rsquo;ve lost, and you&rsquo;re at least a 7 out of 10 &ndash; a man named Conor Smith would very much like to meet you.</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>I was busy at work browsing Facebook when a sweaty, long-haired man calling himself &lsquo;Conor Smith&rsquo; bustled towards me.
