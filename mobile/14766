In her familiar surroundings, Aljohmani focused on the problem of the Hamilton cloak room which is &ldquo;not looked after by anyone&rdquo;, something she considers to be &ldquo;awful&rdquo;. Last night, Aljohmani was the only candidate to speak at Fine Gael hustings, though Rosa Langhammer was absent due to illness. Questions asked addressed areas such as &ldquo;USI, campaigns and lobbying&rdquo;. \u00a0Ahead of this evening&rsquo;s LGBT Q Soc hustings she said: &ldquo;I genuinely love when people engage. I don&rsquo;t like flicking out fliers. [The] LGBT [community] has always been very receptive to the SU.&rdquo;\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Rosa Langhammer</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"> returned to brave campus once more after her enforced absence due to illness yesterday evening. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling a lot better now&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it was good to get a rest yesterday. I did lecture addresses as long as I could. It got to be detrimental to my health and to the people I was talking to!&rdquo; She gave a shout out to fellow Sabbat contender Stephen Garry whose team got medicine for her. That&rsquo;s Welfare for you. Langhammer is delighted with how her team handled things during her brief absence. Today, the candidate stressed the off-campus deals promised in her manifesto. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking one of the five points everyday. Unfortunately, we&rsquo;ve been banned from online campaigning. It&rsquo;s to do with group posting. It was on the Halls page. It was a misunderstanding between the Electoral Commission and all the candidates. Most people seem to have been posting in groups and it&rsquo;s whoever happens to have been &lsquo;print-screened&rsquo; I suppose [that is reprimanded]. Langhammer was looking forward to the opportunity to address students at the LGBT hustings, especially with the upcoming referendum on gender identity.</span>\n<strong style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Tom Lenihan</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">, meanwhile, campaigned during the last day of his hunger strike due to his facebook page being banned.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to crack but we&rsquo;re getting there. I&rsquo;ll probably have pizza at the end of it. People are concerned for my health. Lenihan is not, however, flaunting the topic: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a self-publicist. Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re getting a little bit of publicity that we wouldn&rsquo;t want&rdquo; he said, referring to stories run in some of the national papers concerning his running for office due his family&rsquo;s political background, one including a photo taken from the candidate&rsquo;s facebook profile. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t \u00a0asked about it and we&rsquo;re certainly not going to speak to anyone about it. I&rsquo;m not happy about it but we&rsquo;ll move on.&rdquo; A number of media networks have attempted to discuss the story with him. &ldquo;The Herald, Raidi\u00f3 na Life and RT\u00c9 Radio One tried to speak to us. We can&rsquo;t talk to them. Even if our hands weren&rsquo;t tied (by Electoral Commission regulations), I probably wouldn&rsquo;t talk to them because they want it to be more personality-driven than manifesto-driven.&rdquo; Lenihan travelled to the School of Medicine at St James&rsquo;s Hospital today and intended to focus on the issue of mental health &ndash; a staple of his campaign &ndash; during LGBT hustings.</span>\n<em>Fionn O'Dea</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 19px;\">Communications</span></h3>\nAfter successfully negotiating the ripostes of Dining Hall Hustings, the candidates settled in for day three of the campaign week. Arguably one of the toughest days on the trail in relation to sustaining momentum, the candidates chose the midweek mark to unveil some more stunts, and were drawn on some of the substantive issues of the campaign.\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Leanna Byrne</strong> had promised a stunt today from day one, and true to expectation she revealed a &lsquo;face-in-the-hole&rsquo; board which outlines her plans and aims for her campaign. She coupled the cardboard stunt with the promise of another video soon. <strong>Tommy Gavin</strong> took a similar approach with his stunt, preferring an image of an astronaut as his mascot; Gavin sees the image as being representative of his commitment to technology and innovation, and representative of the future media he aims to produce. Gavin also updated his manifesto to include a plan for message boards on the SU website.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Matt Taylor</strong> continued to utilise his mannequin, &lsquo;The Student Body&rsquo;, around campus, with the aim of the item being to encourage students to cite problems with the SU and proffer suggestions for change. His campaign team also held doors open for people in the arts block as an ancillary stunt. <strong>Ricky McCormick</strong> remains the only candidate in this race to have not yet engaged in some form of stunt, preferring still to focus on speaking in lecture theatres. His first campaign video was released today, however, and Ricky&rsquo;s campaign manager, Lydia Rahill, has confirmed that we can expect a stunt &ldquo;probably tomorrow.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">At the previous day&rsquo;s hustings the issue of editorial independence was tendered by candidates and students alike. We put the question to the candidates, yesterday evening and this afternoon, to find out how they would go about protecting editorial independence in <em>The University Times.</em></span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Ricky McCormick</strong> affirmed that for him &ldquo;editorial independence means that any story the UT comes across that casts a light on the SU that is potentially damaging for its reputation is able to be reported on in full. Reports on the mistakes or failures of colleagues can certainly be a cause of tension but the duty of the Communications officer is to the electorate that mandate them with a responsibility to inform them of what their union is doing.&rdquo; McCormick has claimed that the UT has become an SU mouthpiece, and he would prefer to see a position where this is not the case.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Tommy Gavin</strong>, an original proposer of the question at Hustings, stated that for him, &ldquo;editorial independence for me is a matter of ethics and integrity. I came to Trinity after completing a HND in journalism, so I kept this idea of the importance of journalism as a force for social good. I think it is an interesting situation we've arrived at where the Communications officer is the UT editor. Contrary to Ricky's implication that it&rsquo;s an SU mouthpiece I can say from experience that that has never been the case. Maybe because the Comms officer spends so much time and effort on the UT, they get protective of it. To be honest, I'm already protective of it, which is the main reason I'm running.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On the issue, <strong>Matt Taylor</strong> held a similar belief to McCormick, claiming &ldquo;too often nowadays, UT has become a mouthpiece for the SU, even to the extent that it praises SU activities which are patently failing us. I believe UT can be fully independent. Editorial independence means not being shy of criticising the organisation which technically supports you. As Communications officer my job would be to get the correct information to students, even if it meant criticising the people that I had to work with on a daily basis.&rdquo; Taylor has proposed the implementation of an editorial board to help him achieve these aims.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Leanna Byrne</strong> emphasised her experience when asked about editorial independence, noting that, &ldquo;[it] is the lifeblood of <em>The University Times</em>. I believe strongly in it and previous editors I&rsquo;ve worked with have held the exact same values.&rdquo; Furthermore she is &ldquo;dedicated to uncovering and reporting on stories that are important to students. Editorial independence relates specifically to professionalism and the obligations of journalists to be fair and balanced. Communications officers have a difficult role as a mandated officer and an editor, but professionalism always wins in situations where there is a conflict of interest.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">My job as communications officer would never interfere with my role as editor of UT. Each role is as important as the other.&rdquo;</span>\n\nAll in all the campaigns seem to be gathering momentum. The candidates are providing a solid mix of policy and interactive stunts, both of which are capturing the imagination of students.\n\n<em>By Conor Bates. \u00a0Additional reporting by Hannah Ryan.</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ents</h3>\nAfter an entertaining performance at yesterday's hustings, the<strong> Shmeesh</strong> campaign was less visible on the ground today. Instead, the Shmeesh campaign sought to utilise their superior online presence, posting a series of erotic Facebook photos of Shmeesh surrounded by adoring, semi-naked fans. Speaking to this reporter, campaign manager David 'Shmee' Egan was upbeat about the campaign. \"Another great day on the campaign trail. Shmeesh began the day by addressing lectures halls with some of his new poetry. Many campaigners got up and spoke, yet it seemed Shmeesh was the only one that captured their imagination.\u00a0After the riveting success of the photo 'Shmeesh has you covered' (check facebook page).... today saw the unveiling of 'Shmeesh's Angels'. A photo showing the support from Shmeesh's contingent of women campaigners. The photo quickly reached the quota of 300 likes within the hour, and a new photo of 'Shmeesh with all his Angels facing the camera (tops off) is on the verge of being released. We're positive that it will be received well within college circles.\" Egan finished his daily recap with the unofficial Shmeesh campaign moto \"hon the lads\".\n\n<strong>Cameron Macauley</strong> dominated the arts block today as his \"trinity ball tix\" went on sale. Promising \"oasis\", a coverband of Oasis and three members of The Fratellis, fans were left disappointed after the quota of 15 tickets quickly sold out. With a promise of fish and chips at the door, Cameron confirmed the availability of vaccinations against typhoid and polio. Cameron impressed at the LGBT \u00a0hustings stating the need for less weeks about rainbows and more weeks for LGBT issues.\n\n<strong>Cian Mulville</strong> prepared himself for this evening&rsquo;s LGBT hustings by paying a visit to the Q-Soc society room in House 6. Mulville has added to his online promotion by photoshopping his face onto the bodies of Jamie Foxx and Beyonce Knowles. Mulville has also used his Facebook to address the concerns of students, ensuring them that if elected his &lsquo;monthly accounts will be published for all students to see&rsquo;. Mulville espoused one of the core tenets of his manifesto at tonight&rsquo;s LGBT event, detailing his plans for an intervarsity LGBT night along with DIT and IADT, claiming &lsquo;it would be the biggest LGBT student night in Dublin&rsquo;, adding that he would &lsquo;give Q-Soc the authority to run the kind of night they want to run&rsquo;. Mulville was keen to stress his own proposed non-alcoholic events which include &lsquo;Zumba classes, poker nights, five-a-side tournaments and ways to de-stress without going out on the piss&rsquo;.\n\n<strong>Sean Reynolds</strong> went into day three of his Ents campaign several T-shirts short as a result of an EC sanction, doled out in response to his Halls event on Monday night. Reynolds was chipper about the situation, however, choosing to focus on the LGBT hustings - which he referred to as today&rsquo;s &lsquo;main act&rsquo;. Reynolds was critical of opponent Conor Shmeesh Gleeson, who did not take part in this evening&rsquo;s hustings, telling <em>The University Times</em> that &lsquo;if he [Shmeesh] is in any way serious about his campaign, he should be obligated to participate in hustings&rsquo;. <em>The University Times</em> understands that Gleeson will be engaging in a one-on-one discussion with debater moderator David Doyle on Friday, should he commit to contesting the election outright. Reynolds himself used the LGBT hustings to promote his message of inclusivity for all Trinity students, asserting his aim to &lsquo;make college as welcoming as it could be&rsquo; for LGBT and afterwards hailing his proposed on-campus live music events as events that can be &lsquo;appealing to those students who seek out events that are less based around alcohol&rsquo;, and students under the age of 18.\n\n<em>Shauna Cleary &amp; Carl Kinsella</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 1.17em; line-height: 19px;\">Education\u00a0</span></h3>\n<strong>\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>John Curtin</strong> spent much of his day like many candidates: visiting lectures and speaking to students. &ldquo;What I was saying was well received, especially in the new biomedical sciences building. The students here commented on how, like I have suggested, something so simple such as being able to get a breakdown of results online would make such a difference.&rdquo; Curtin also hopes to prove to voters that although he may have less experience in student government than his opponents, he believes he is the best candidate for the job. &ldquo;I think at this point, it is important once again to stress that my slogan &lsquo;Don't vote blind, Vote Curtin&rsquo; is more than just a clever pun. In essence, it encompasses on being an informed voter, looking to the future and to what I want to change.&rdquo; If elected, Curtin hopes to improve study abroad opportunities for College students. He pointed out that Trinity&rsquo;s international collaboration is &ldquo;very much Arts-based as opposed to College-based.&rdquo; Curtin explained he was lucky to be able to study in Paris through his Law and French studies, but that the same opportunity cannot be enjoyed by students in other schools. &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t someone in Engineering even have the option to go to half the places that [Law students] can go to to expand their horizons?&rdquo; he said.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Jack Leahy&rsquo;s</strong> campaign has a new face: Harrison, a character from the film\u00a0Brave. &ldquo;Our mascot Harrison has been really popular,&rdquo; Leahy told this reporter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to bring a playful undertone to these things, since they get very heavy sometimes.&rdquo; With the LGBTQ Husting today, Leahy spoke to this reporter on how his employable skills program could be beneficial for LGBTQ students. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to include a module in that on workplace discrimination and how to deal with it, and [a module on] patient care and patient interaction for medical students, specifically dealing with transgender and LGBT patients.&rdquo; Leahy also stated his intention to, if elected, lobby for gender neutral forms in College, including gender-neutral bathrooms and room applications and providing students with gender-neutral options when filling out College forms.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\"><strong>Eric Tebay</strong> also spent today visiting lectures and speaking to students on his qualifications for the position of education officer and also touching on one of the main points of his manifesto, a plan to create an Education Facebook page where students have a forum to discuss all things education-related and ask questions directly to the Education officer. When asked if he thinks students will feel comfortable being honest in such a public forum, Tebay said, &ldquo;I think social networking is a very powerful tool nowadays&hellip;almost everyone has a Facebook, and it&rsquo;s not like some discussion forum that you&rsquo;ve never heard of. If you&rsquo;re friends with the Education officer page, an issue that is relevant to you will come up on your news feed&mdash;have your say, write a comment, and I&rsquo;ll be taking all those opinions back to College.&rdquo; Tebay is confident that students will give feedback more easily when it&rsquo;s as easy as logging onto Facebook.</span>\n<em>Becky Prager</em>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Welfare</h3>\nTonight saw LGBT hustings which is of huge significance to the Welfare officer. During the hustings sole candidate <strong>Stephen Garry</strong> stressed that many issues close to the LGBT community are addressed in his manifesto. As well as introducing the campaigns &lsquo;Labels are not for People&rsquo; to remove derogatory language around college, and a new &lsquo;Equality Week&rsquo; into the college calendar, he wants to work closely with the Rainbow Week committee to ensure the campaign reaches its full potential. Furthermore he wishes to introduce training and education programmes for the Welfare office in Halls to guarantee there is a certified ally equipped to help. \u00a0Speaking to <em>The University Times</em> this evening, Garry commented on his\u00a0\"nostalgic trip\" to Trinity Halls last night and said he was \u00a0\"delighted with the feedback\". \u00a0He went on to say that off-campus students had \u00a0\"very positive reactions to the Ambassador scheme and the welfare live chat and Skype. We also received a lot of suggestions regarding how the union can better engage with students in health sciences and I'll be taking these suggestions on board as part of an overall focus on collaboration.\"\n\n<em>Rebecca O'Keeffe</em>", "Imageurl": "14767", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/trinity-elects23", "ID": "14766", "Heading": "Trinity Elects: Day Three"}
