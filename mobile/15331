Welcome to the Cheltenham Festival, the greatest show on turf.\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Cheltenham connects with the public like no other event in horse racing. It opens the sport up to outsiders as they peer into the 4 days of madness in Prestbury Park. Nowhere is this fascination more acute then right here in Ireland. Horse racing is the only global sport that Ireland can lay claim to being the best in the world at. It employs over 20,000 people and is worth 2 billion euro to the Irish economy. Yet for many it is these 4 days when they choose to interact with the sport. They pick up their paper, pick out their fancies and make a flutter. When the Irish win at Cheltenham it fills our pride and our wallets.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">The Irish Cheltenham greats roll off the tongue in any household, Istabraq, Arkle, Moscow Flyer, Hardy Eustace, Brave Inca. Who will make their name a table quiz answer this year? Will Hurricane Fly regain his crown in the Champion Hurdle? Can Quevega make it five in a row? Could Sir Des Champs win the Gold Cup for Willie Mullins? These questions spark such great intrigue and that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re delighted to be teaming up with <em>The University Times</em> to deliver unparallel coverage all week.</span></p>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">We have a dedicated micro site on <em>The University Times</em> page all week where we&rsquo;ll be previewing every race of the 4 days of racing followed by a review of the day&rsquo;s action after each day. We hope to point you in the direction of some tasty winners and add to the enjoyment of the best 4 days racing has to offer.</span>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\"><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">What&rsquo;s in store for us this Cheltenham, who knows? The only thing for certain is that it will enthral us, shock us and have us roaring at our television screens. <em>The University Times</em> and Horse Racing Society will be right there with you for every moment. Get ready for the greatest show on turf. Just say a prayer we find a few winners.</span></p>\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "15332", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15331", "Heading": "The Magic of Cheltenham"}
