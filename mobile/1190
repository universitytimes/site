She said that she intends to retire fully from public life as she had missed the university lifestyle during her two seven-year terms as President. She added that there was \"no better university lifestyle than actually being a student.\"\n\nWhen asked by Phil President Declan Meehan where she intended to study, the President remarked that she had some ideas but \"I'm not going to tell you.\" On being asked if she felt constrained by her office, and if she would prefer to have some executive powers, McAleese replied that she \"knows the job description\" and that \"it would be a very arrogant president who would step over the constitutional line that had been drawn by the Irish people\"\n\nShe said that she expected \"some review of the role of President\" in the future, but that if it occurred she would be staying silent on the issue. When asked what was the single most important thing for the current generation to do to continue the work started through the peace process, the President remarked that \"we need to take it seriously\", as she had seen peace turn to violence which lasted thirty years.", "Imageurl": "1191", "Thumb_nail": "http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/mcaleese", "ID": "1190", "Heading": "McAleese to return to student life"}
