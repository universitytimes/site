{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>In 2007 Iceland was voted the best place in the world to live. Then the whole banking sector collapsed, bringing the country with it, seemingly overnight. People got angry; angrier than ever before. For the country that is undoubtedly the worst affected by this global financial crisis decided enough was enough. A year ago the Icelanders took to the streets, literally banging pots and pans in the &lsquo;Saucepan Revolution&rsquo;, outside of the parliament building in Reykjavik. &nbsp;They started a citizen&rsquo;s revolt against the government and the bankers who had colluded in the financial collapse which saw the Krona collapse in 2008. The country went from 1% unemployment to having dole offices suddenly overwhelmed with professionals from all sectors as it soared to almost 10%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Last weekend they continued what will hopefully be a revolt against the banks. Not just a revolt in Iceland, but also in Spain, Greece and, most importantly, in Ireland. &nbsp;The referendum &nbsp;which they voted on (and which they demanded in the first place) offered Icelanders the chance to choose whether or not to repay 3.9 billion to the British and Dutch governments who had to compensate 400,000 of their own who lost money when Icesave accounts, run by one of Iceland&rsquo;s failed banks, collapsed. &nbsp;. If the referendum passed the Icelanders would have had to pay between 12,000 and 20,000 &nbsp;euro each because of the greed of their banks. They voted no; overwhelmingly so at 93% . Indeed quite why the Icelandic government should be liable for the UK&rsquo;s entirely voluntary decision to bail out Icesave customers is a mystery.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The similarities between Iceland and Ireland are uncanny. It is no longer a question of &lsquo;one letter and six months&rsquo;, we are beyond that joke at this point. Both our governments refused a public inquiry into the cause of the financial crisis, the Icelandic government has shelved the results of a long promised investigation into their financial mess twice. As in Ireland, the banks have been bailed out, and many of the same people are still in charge.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since last year the Icelanders have been &nbsp;trying to fight the banks and prevent repossession. Demonstrations have taken place on a daily basis all because of the Icelanders commitment to not give in to a selfish government. &nbsp;One particular organisation, called the Hagsmunasamtok Heimlimna is at the forefront of these demonstrations. The organisation was established with the aim that they will have an &lsquo;army&rsquo; of supporters ready 24/7 &nbsp;to help people if police try to evict them from their homes. HH supporters have been gathering outside of parliament buildings every Saturday for months in a bid to show the government their growing frustration. &nbsp;They are currently in the process of organising a strike where people stop paying the banks altogether. Those with money are being asked to stop paying in solidarity with those who can&rsquo;t. In further echoes with Ireland, where the government &nbsp;has raided the national pension fund for Nama, the left wing Green coalition in Iceland is encouraging citizens to spend their pensions now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What Iceland has done should be considered a huge success. They stood up to their governments and their banks, something which the Irish seem to be too afraid to do. What we need to do as &nbsp;a nation is show some solidarity. We should be supporting the Public sector workers next Monday, we should be taking to the streets with the pensioners and we should be viral in our efforts. This is exactly how Iceland did it. Young people all over Iceland communicated in real time with each other on social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and MySpace. They invited members of the governments to answer questions publicly, without any help from aides or advisors. The government got scared. They felt unprepared and started listening to the plight of their fellow citizens. Then came all the &lsquo;saucepan revolutions&rsquo;, which managed to bring down the centre-right government at the time. The heads of the central banks and the financial regulator also resigned. So why can&rsquo;t we do this in Ireland? Why can&rsquo;t our young generation get together and show our dissatisfaction? We will after all be the people who will bear the brunt of this economic crisis in years to come. Apathy should not be an issue. The money that we are paying to Anglo Irish Bank is more than enough to give us a great health and education system. We should be holding our government accountable for this mess that they have put us in; a revolution is needed. &nbsp;I will leave you with this quote from one Icelandic voter; it may make you think. &ldquo;I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to an unfair deal, with a colonising mentality. I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the oppression of the small by the big. I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to global capitalism. I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to greed. I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo; to standing by as my people take on burdens which do not belong on their shoulders. I voted &ldquo;No&rdquo;. Tomorrow the world will follow my lead.&rdquo;</p>\n", "Imageurl": "<p>\n</p><p>In 2007 Iceland was voted the best place in the world to live.
