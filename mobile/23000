Eight of the world&rsquo;s largest medical device companies are located in Ireland, employing 25,000 people.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Trinity is home to one of Europe&rsquo;s leading biomechanics research centres &ndash; the Trinity Centre for Bioengineering, while RCSI is the centre for surgical training in Ireland and houses the country&rsquo;s largest medical school.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"keepright\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;The hosting of the WCB in Ireland is a significant endorsement of Ireland&rsquo;s leadership position in the area of biomechanics research.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Director General of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and Chief Scientific Adviser to the Irish Government, Professor Mark Ferguson, said: &ldquo;The hosting of the WCB in Ireland is a significant endorsement of Ireland&rsquo;s leadership position in the area of biomechanics research. It will bring important international focus to the recently established AMBER SFI Research Centre.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The AMBER (Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research), in collaboration with University College Cork and RCSI, is hosted in Trinity College. The centre aims to deliver internationally leading materials research enabled by new discoveries and devices in ICT, medical device and industrial technology sectors.</p>\r\nProfessor Schmid-Sch\u00f6nbein President of the World Council of Biomechanics added: &ldquo;Despite being a small country, Ireland has, for many years now, been one of the leading countries in Europe in terms of biomechanics research and we are very pleased that the meeting will be held in the dynamic city of Dublin and anticipate an exciting and successful congress.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/From-front-arch31.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23000", "Heading": "Trinity to Host World Congress of Biomechanics in 2018"}
