Despite being distracted by a group of people who insisted on talking loudly while the it was going on (highly unfair, because I find it hard enough to concentrate on anime as it is), and by the prevalent Hist propaganda (did you know that there was no Hist auditor from 1830-32? Neither did I), I think I can safely say I learnt something about this &lsquo;fanslation&rsquo; lark (it's when fans translate manga so that English speakers can read it. But there's a big piracy issue. That's where the Pirate Party come in. Linkage). With the talk itself aimed at readers of manga and members of its community, I was, needless to say, slightly out of my depth. But after Arann McMahon, Japanese Soc&rsquo;s PRO, told me that you don&rsquo;t have to like manga &lsquo;at all&rsquo; to be in the Japanese Society, I felt like I was back in familiar society territory, where people tell me what they do, what events they have, and who&rsquo;s in their society.\u00a0I did learn a bit about manga, though. Seriously.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/29/manga-on-the-high-seas/196851_198322936874083_7394296_n/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13775\"><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-13775\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/196851_198322936874083_7394296_n3-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" /></a></p>\n\u00a0Before I talked to Arann, however, I had business to attend to with the Pirate Party Society (yes, that <em>is</em> their official name). First of all, who are they? &ldquo;Pirate Party was formed in Sweden a good couple of years back,&rdquo; their PRO Ian Hunter tells me. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a political party and they&rsquo;ve got three things on their agenda.&rdquo; The first, copyright reform, the second, patent reform, &ldquo;and the final one is privacy and freedom of speech, so here in Trinity we do a lot of stuff with privacy on the internet.&rdquo; And there I was thinking that all they did was dress up as Captain Jack and have &lsquo;expeditions&rsquo;, something I recommended they do in their down time. &ldquo;We have to, we really do,&rdquo; says Ian, laughing. The chair, Mike Gallagher, says that they&rsquo;re already halfway there. &ldquo;In the constitution, I&rsquo;m the captain,&rdquo; he says. I suggest using that in their publicity more. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t want to mess around with wooden legs and neckerchiefs?\n\nAside from that, though, they are a serious society who don&rsquo;t like &ldquo;filler events&rdquo;. &ldquo;We try to have meaningful events,&rdquo; says Mike, that involve speakers. As for the committee, they&rsquo;re mainly computer science students for whom the issue of piracy, and practically anything else concerning the internet, is close to home. However, they are keen to express that their society &ldquo;does apply to everyone because everyone does use the internet,&rdquo; and that their membership has doubled to 120 in the past year. But what&rsquo;s the main thing on their agenda? Ian explains. &ldquo;We get in contact with external groups, so this year we hosted the CryptoParty Ireland, which is newly formed. They&rsquo;re an external group and it was their first meet up so we helped host them... and then also the protest for SOPA [Stop Online Piracy Act] last year, we had a lot of involvement with that.&rdquo; These computer heads don&rsquo;t faff about, but I want to know what their main belief is, before letting them go to watch the film. &ldquo;We believe in the fundamental ideas of equal rights... we think people&rsquo;s rights are more important than profits,&rdquo; says Mike. And who can refute that?\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.trinitysocieties.ie/files/file4e789caa4d01e.201109201501\" alt=\"\" width=\"289\" height=\"58\" />\n\nThe crossover between the societies did lie in manga, so I had to learn a little bit about it. I&rsquo;m going to be honest, though: to me, manga just looked like Japanese versions of the Beano and Dandy. Arann explains its cross-cultural appeal: &ldquo;part of it is just wanting to escape from western culture into something that&rsquo;s completely different,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the cartoons people watched when they were kids, except it&rsquo;s the evolution of that in that it&rsquo;s more mature.&rdquo; But if the superheroes and high-school dramas of manga aren&rsquo;t your thing, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. The main aim of the society is to &ldquo;run regular cultural events to try to promote Japanese culture.&rdquo; There are language classes, sushi tastings, and origami nights. Arann himself teaches the beginner classes. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s awesome because I feel like I&rsquo;m imparting some of what makes the society and Japanese important to me, and spreading that to other people.&rdquo; There are the obligatory film nights &ldquo;because people can easily identify with that aspect of Japanese culture,&rdquo; but although they attract lots of anime fans, &ldquo;we do get lots of people who are just curious and have never eaten sushi before. It&rsquo;s not all raw fish!&rdquo; Their film pick this week, <em>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</em>, is an independent film, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s also quite a popular one, so small studios can do excellent films as well&rdquo;. Sort of like how small societies can pull of good events, right? Finally, I ask, why should one join the Japanese Society? &ldquo;We offer an insight into a culture that is something completely different to anything we have in the west and anything the vast majority of students would have experienced before,&rdquo; says Arann. And they have free origami classes. You can&rsquo;t mess with that kind of awesome.\n\nFor more information check out <em>www.pirates.ie</em> and <em>www.japanese.csc.tcdlife.ie</em>", "Imageurl": "13774", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/commie-mouretsu-pirates-01-d051076f-mkv_snapshot_01-02_2012-01-09_00-59-433", "ID": "13739", "Heading": "Manga on the High Seas"}
