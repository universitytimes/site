{"Body": "The storyline of the first week in the Ents race is easy to liken to any good movie. It had a big beginning with a dance number (and yeah I said &ldquo;good&rdquo; movie), a low point right around the middle and a triumphant and uplifting ending. A typical story of boy meets girl, boy wants position on SU, so does girl, hilarity ensues. The plot arc was flawless. We&rsquo;ve seen it a million times. Allow me to elaborate.\n\nThe week begins with a bang, Sunday night&rsquo;s battle for poster space and the tag-a-thon on facebook let everyone know, whether they wanted to or not, that is was election time (I saw this as the introductory credit sequence that lets you know who&rsquo;s going to be in the movie and that kind of thing). McDaid and CO&rsquo;C came out strong with an arts block teeming with colorful t-shirts and enthusiasm. Both teams made their intentions for the week clear on the first day. McDaid would be all about information. She wanted to put her ideas before her stunts and focus on the message instead of the image.\n\nOur competing protagonist in this flick enters with his own theme music, which was a little bit different. He&rsquo;s all about the flashy stuff, the character who wants a little revolution to go with the evolution in his Ents department. CO&rsquo;C briefly managed to keep up with the entertainment powerhouse that is Aaron Heffernan (comic relief ) on this first day with public opinion split right down the middle for the candidates but public attention leaning towards Chris. The two main characters definitely had their differences, and weren&rsquo;t shy about admitting them to anyone. We had very different candidates running for a single position and the race couldn&rsquo;t have stayed pretty for much longer. Our audience was captivated, ready, and unfortunately, it was our audience who was about to take a turn for the undesirable.\n\nIn the middle of this - I&rsquo;m gonna say - Rom-Com, there was drama. Tension grew between McDaid and CO&rsquo;C but they kept it professional and on point. The same could not be said for the &ldquo;meddling friend&rdquo; character (played in this movie by both campaigns&rsquo; supporters). The passion with which they both ran their campaigns this week was admirable and impressive. Yet some of this enthusiasm spilled over into the student body in a way that was twisted from its original, well intentioned source. Discussion over policy matters degraded into slander and sexism, mud slinging and slags, which left both our candidates, I mean characters, in a tough spot. The plot had reached a low point, but not for\u00a0long. Both characters and their teams\u00a0felt that all of this had gotten out of hand, peripheral characters had taken a movie as playful and innocent as Bambi on Valentine&rsquo;s day and turned it into Battle Royale, or\u00a0that one really harsh scene in Bambi\u00a0where the mother dies. A meeting was called, mutual agreement that those who supported the campaigns needed to calm down resulted in a statement from both McDaid and CO&rsquo;C. This was the inspirational speech made about ten minutes before the end of the movie, preferably at some kind of formal event. It was the moment when our characters dramatically threw away their tiny cue cards with a speech written on it, and spoke from the heart. They let us know that they cared, and that they didn&rsquo;t want the other person to be attacked or belittled and that we should all just get along, to put it simply. The music would be something really inspirational too. Like Journey or something.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1259\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"COC and Elaine hug it out after the historic accord\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ents.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1259\" title=\"ents\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/ents-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nThe week (and movie) ended with a perfect freeze-frame. With animosity gone and new respect for each other found, we were given this snapshot of the happy, respectful, caring campaign couple. Rather than the PR stunt we&rsquo;ve come to expect from these two, the picture sent a message to campaigners - we want to win this, but we don&rsquo;t want to hurt each other.\n\nThe message of the movie is simple. There is conflict, but it a professional conflict, one which voters\u00a0will resolve in the coming week (a week i will now in my head see as\u00a0the sequel or maybe the writing that comes on the bottom of the screen that summarizes how each character&rsquo;s life went after the movie is over) and while things can get out of hand, this is a PG movie, its purpose is not to challenge us, it is not there to make us think deeply about our own lives or get too emotionally involved, it&rsquo;s purpose is to entertain. Now you may find it unusual that I&rsquo;ve almost completely omitted policy from this piece, but at this stage, if your&rsquo;re just tuning in, there&rsquo;s 5 other articles all about policy and conflict, there are literally hundreds of manifestos flying around the college and candidates who are actively seeking anyone they have not yet talked to about why they are a better choice. Enjoy any of these things and you can make an informed decision on Tuesday, but for now, just enjoy the show.\n\nJack Toner", "Imageurl": "1259", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1404", "Heading": "Ents: a Tale to Warm the Heart"}
