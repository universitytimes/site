Hahn, born in Switzerland, began experimenting with music at an early age; but chose to step-back from it to focus on his studies in Vancouver. After a three year hiatus, Hahn returned to the scene and did what some people considered taboo: he stripped-down and remixed two iconic R&amp;B songs (</span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyrilhahn/mariah-carey-touch-my-body\">Mariah Carey&rsquo;s 'Touch My Body'</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">\u00a0and\u00a0</span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;\" href=\"https://soundcloud.com/cyrilhahn/destinys-child-say-my-name\">Destiny&rsquo;s Child 'Say My Name'</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">).</span>\n\nThe remixes slowed and warped vocals, eerily twisted melodies and infused generic R&amp;B lyrics with haunting human emotion. Needless to say they were an overnight hit and furnished Hahn with a huge online following (&lsquo;Say My Name&rsquo; has been viewed over 1.7m times); and also drew praise from music bigwigs like Annie Mac and The XX. Recently named by Timeout as &ldquo;officially the coolest man in the world right now&rdquo;, here Hahn caught-up with UT Online Editor Josh Roberts as he prepares for his first European tour this spring.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>University Times (UT): How would you describe your music / sound?</strong>\n\nCyril Hahn (CH): It&rsquo;s always hard to describe your own music especially since my influences are all over the place which results in my sound being a strange mix of a lot of different genres. I really like writing music that makes you wanna dance without being too clubby or aggressive.\n\n<iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/g6uvdpsyV9c\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 13px;\">UT: What music did you listen to growing-up and who do you rate now?</strong>\n\nCH: When I was growing up I only listened to punk &amp; hardcore and was fairly narrow minded in terms of other types of music. I always liked the lo-fi aesthetic of the records I grew up with. I think noise gives a song more character, a certain organic quality. That&rsquo;s why I often include white noise or field recordings in my production. I don&rsquo;t want my song to sound too sterile or mechanical.\n\nThen slowly I started appreciating folk, post-rock, hip hop, ambient and electronic stuff. It was probably musicians like The Field or Caribou which really made me appreciate steady kick drums.\n\nWho do I rate now? Man, there&rsquo;s so many. I&rsquo;m just gonna list what pops into my head first and try and keep it short&hellip; Evian Christ, Shlohmo, Holy Other, Disclosure, Bicep, Knxwledge, Twin Shadow, How to Dress Well, Grimes, Lotus Plaza, Lapalux, Teebs, Ryan Hemsworth, Fort Romeau, DIIV.\n\n<strong>UT: What inspires your music?</strong>\n\nCH: Toro Y Moi&rsquo;s new album, Irmgard Keun and the TV series &ldquo;Treme&rdquo;.\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 13px;\">UT: In the past you have been a banjo-playing, folk musician. Why did you change direction?</strong>\n\nCH: In high school I started playing guitar and recorded post-rock songs on my computer as I was really into Explosions in the Sky, Mogwai and those kind of bands. Then I started writing folk songs and even picked up the banjo for a bit. About 3 years ago or so I got really bored of my own music and stopped writing completely. Early this year I decided to give electronic music a try and that&rsquo;s when my Mariah Carey remix came about. <strong></strong>\n<strong>UT: Your fan base is very internat\u00a0</strong><strong style=\"font-size: 13px;\">ional, do audiences in different countries react differently to your music?</strong>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px;\">CH: It's hard to say but I think so. Europe definitely seems to be a lot fonder of house/dance music than Canada where I live at the moment. I haven't played outside of Canada so far so I'm really excited to see how people will react to my music during my debut European tour.</span>\n<div>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15087\" title=\"CH\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CH3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" />\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>UT: How has your &lsquo;Say My Name&rsquo; remix impacted your career?</strong>\n\nCH: Well, I didn&rsquo;t anticipate the response to my remixes until I started getting a lot of concert offers!\n\n<strong>UT: What advice would you have for aspiring musicians and producers?</strong>\n\nCH: Don't think or worry about the result, just start writing. Even if you don't end up finishing a song, you learn something new with each sketch or idea. At least that seems to be the case for me. Also, don't\nworry about gear too much. You can produce with a really minimal set up these days when you are starting out.\n\n<strong style=\"font-size: 13px;\">UT: What are you most looking forward to in Ireland?</strong>\n\nCH: Hurling! It&rsquo;s one of the craziest sports I have ever watched. Also it&rsquo;s just such a nice place to visit. I travelled along the West Coast of Ireland a few years back and it was a truly memorable trip.\n\n<strong>UT: What are your &lsquo;tour essentials&rsquo;? </strong>\n\nCH: My gear, Advil, a good book, and some Seinfeld episodes on my laptop for when I get bored on the plane.<strong></strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Cyril Hahn is performing at Button Factory on March 6th 2013.
