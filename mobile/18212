{"Body": "Doreen Burke and Negar Sharafi-\n\nMother&rsquo;s Day is often the bane of many children&rsquo;s lives. &ldquo;Why is there no Children&rsquo;s Day?&rdquo; we often asked as young &lsquo;uns. The answer was always the same witty one liner...&rdquo;Because every day is Children&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo; Yes, it is a Hallmark holiday with very little or no historical significance. Yes, we only know it&rsquo;s a-coming when every end-aisle of M&amp;S begin to blossom with sweet greeting cards and pink frosting topped cupcakes. But there is no doubting the fact that the day is an appreciative reminder to mothers of how important they are.\nInstead of shelling out wads of cash of over-priced supermarket flowers, boring boxes of chocolates and cheesy cards, why not invest some time for your dear Mum instead?\nA homemade meal and some sinfully good cakes are the perfect way to please your mother.\n\nWe&rsquo;ve compiled a scrumptious menu to let your Ma know how special she is (and what a great son/daughter you are!)\n\n<strong>Lemony Roast Chicken*</strong>\n\nIf you really want to make your Mum happy, how about a nice home-cooked meal? A roast chicken looks really impressive, but is very easy to make. And the best thing is, once the chicken is in the oven, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about it. Just leave it there, check on it from time to time and after 1 \u02dd hours you&rsquo;ll have a deliciously succulent roast chicken, perfect served with honey and mustard roast vegetables (recipe below).\n\nYou need:\n\n<em>1 whole chicken giblets removed (ask your butcher to do this)\n1 - 2 lemons or lots of lemon juice\nthyme (fresh or dried)\ngarlic (can be left out)\nolive oil\nsalt and pepper</em>\n\nPreheat the oven to 190\u00b0C.\nRub the chicken inside and out with a halved lemon and drizzle some olive oil on it (inside as well if you like). Rub in lots of salt and pepper and place the chicken in an oven dish. Make a mixture of 50ml of olive oil, more lemon juice (depending on how lemony you like your chicken) a dash of water and about a tablespoon full of thyme and pour it over the chicken. If you like garlic, peel some garlic cloves and stuff inside the chicken. Cook in the oven for about 1 \u02dd hours, but check on it after 1 hour and pour some of the olive oil/lemon juice mixture in the dish over it. Cook until the meat isn&rsquo;t pink anymore and the skin is crispy and golden.\n\n*Recipe adapted from Jamie Oliver - Jamie&rsquo;s Dinners\n\n<strong>\nHoney and Mustard Roast Vegetables</strong>\n\nThis side is perfect to go along with the roast chicken, and so easy to prepare. It is versatile and also excellent as a vegetarian main course served with couscous and a spicy dressing.\n\nYou need:\n\n<em>2 tbsps wholegrain mustard (Lakeshore is good)\n2 tbsps runny honey\nSelection of vegetables (red onions, parsnips, carrots, peppers, aubergines, whole garlic cloves and courgettes all work excellently)\nDrizzle of olive oil</em>\n\nPeel the vegetables and chop them into sizeable chunks. Cover with mustard and honey. Exact measurements are hard to dictate as it depends on the size and quantity of the vegetables. Basically you want enough mustard and honey mix to coat them. A drizzle of olive oil, and place into a hot oven, along with the roast chicken for 30-40 minutes or until cooked through and golden brown.<strong> </strong>\n<strong>\nAlmost Flour-less Chocolate Tarte</strong>\n\nIs your mum a chocoholic? Once she tries this gorgeous chocolate tarte, no ordinary chocolate cake will ever compare.\n\nYou need:\n\n<em>200g butter\n200g dark chocolate (at least 70% cocoa)\n250g sugar\n5 eggs\n1 tbsp flour</em>\n\nMelt the butter with the chocolate in a small pot, stirring continuously. Once it&rsquo;s all melted, add sugar and let it cool for about 5 minutes. Then add one egg after the other and mix the batter with an electrical mixer and add the flour in the end. Once it&rsquo;s all smooth and even, pour the mixture into a round cake pan (if you have one for tartes/quiches that&rsquo;s perfect, if not just use a regular one). Bake at 180\u00b0C for about 20-25 minutes. To see if it&rsquo;s ready, stick a toothpick into the centre. There should (almost) be no batter sticking to the toothpick when you pull it out.\n\nLet the cake cool for about 5 minutes before serving. At that stage, the cake is perfectly moist, almost like a brownie. Of course you could let it cool completely, but it&rsquo;s even better when it&rsquo;s still hot with a scoop of ice cream on top (see recipe for homemade ice cream below).\n\n<strong>Easiest Ever Homemade Ice-cream</strong>\n\nWhip two cartons of cream (500ml) until they form soft peaks. Add in a whole tin of condensed milk and stir to combine. Add flavouring of your choice. Chopped up chocolate bars e.g. Crunchie, Bounty, Maltesers, Snickers, After-Eights are great, also try combinations such as frozen fruits and lemon zest or vanilla extract for a plainer take.\n\nFreeze over night and serve with the chocolate tarte; a perfect Mother&rsquo;s Day dessert.", "Imageurl": "2775", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18212", "Heading": "Making a meal out of Mother&#039;s Day"}
