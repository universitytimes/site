An estimated 4,000 people attended the march from City Hall to the Department of Justice.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The event,\u00a0organised\u00a0by LGBT Noise, is an attempt to put pressure on the government to legislate for same sex marriage. As it stands LGBT couples are entitled to civil partnerships, however, this does not entitle LGBT couples to the same marital and legal rights as those afforded to\u00a0heterosexual\u00a0couples.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Speaking at the march, USI Equality Officer Laura Harmon said &ldquo;We couldn't be happier with the turnout from students. Students from the length and breadth of the country and their elected representatives from students' unions have joined up with USI and other organisations to support equal access to civil marriage in Ireland.&rdquo;</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Harmon went on to add that USI would be stepping up its efforts on this issue, calling the March For Marriage &ldquo;just the start of our campaign for the year&rdquo;.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Both Q Soc, the representative body for LBGT students in Trinity, and the SU were in attendance at the march. Joel McKeever, Auditor of Q Soc, spoke of the importance of the event. &ldquo;It's great to see so many students supporting their rights, and the rights of their friends and relatives. It's a very essential step to get real social change in this country and we're very happy with how it's gone.&rdquo;</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">LGBT Noise activists have highlighted the upcoming Constitutional Convention as a key moment in their efforts to secure equal marriage in Ireland. Those involved in the March For Marriage, along with the wider LGBT community, have called upon Taoiseach Enda Kenny to join his Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore, in committing to legislate for same-sex marriage.</p>", "Imageurl": "11658", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "11657", "Heading": "4,000 in March for Equal Marriage Rights"}
