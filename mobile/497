{"Body": "<p>\n</p><p>2009 was an exceptional year for one Trinity science graduate. The Boyle medal for exceptional advances in scientific research was inaugurated in 1889 and over the years it has been won by many distinguished scientists, including John Joly (1911), Patrick Cunningham (1996) and Garret A. FitzGerald (2005). Recently, one of Trinity&rsquo;s very own lecturers, Professor Luke O&rsquo;Neill won this very prestigious award for his ground breaking research into the molecular understanding of innate immunity and inflammatory diseases. O&rsquo;Neill was also announced in November by Minister Brian Leninhen as winner of Science Foundation Ireland&rsquo;s first &ldquo;researcher of the year&rdquo; award.

He went on to complete a Ph.D. in Pharmacology at the University of London (Royal College of Surgeons) in 1988.

Probably the most well-known research to eminate from O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s lab was the discovery of a human protein called MAL in white blood cells (lymphocytes) that acts as a master switch or an alarm system, turning on the immune response to harmful bacteria which can pose a huge threat to the body &ndash; a process which for so many years was misunderstood. This in turn directs the function and response of toll like receptors, a class of proteins that play a key role in the innate immune system to trigger inflammation. They are single membrane-spanning non-catalytic receptors that recognize structurally conserved molecules derived from microbes, bacterial or viral pathogens that can cause infection. He also had many other impressive advances with his research team in the last couple of years alone. Their research into the pox viruses (e.g. small pox, cow pox) was based around the virus&rsquo; many ways of disabling our immune system and diminishing the body&rsquo;s defenses.
