Yeesh, it sure doesn't look like a great year, at least in terms of art direction. <em>Journey</em> is the only game I would actually root for for best game of the year (I am so sorry, <em>Zelda</em>, I hope you can forgive me). It is kind of cute that they put the 3DS games in there, I am sure it was an honour to be nominated. Nods were also given to the sports/racing genre, as well as the PC as a platform, although it is not likely that they will win. <em>Trials Evolution</em> is not winning, I don't know how you got here but please dirtbike out. Most of this seems to boil down to a three horse race - <em>Gears of War</em> vs <em>Uncharted</em> vs <em>Skyrim</em> (with a small chance of <em>Batman</em> taking the award). I hope to be surprised, but I heavily doubt I will be - there is always the possibility that <em>COD</em> fans might mobilise to decimate the awards. <em>Zelda</em>, please go back to your sense of exploration.\u00a0 Come back to rolling green hills that I can dash through... Bring back that sense of giddiness you get when you find a hidden cave where you can find a mysterious ocarina song. It is only then that we will talk about your game of the year prospects.\n\n<strong>Niall O'Colmain</strong>\n<em>Staff Writer</em>\n\n'Ultimate Game of the Year', eh? <em>Skyrim</em> will probably win. Why? Well... <em>Fifa</em> and <em>Forza</em> are games which are appealing to their niche markets, but have\u00a0lukewarm reception outside of them at best. Ditto with the 2011 released <em>Dark Souls</em>, one of my personal favourite games of last year, but we&rsquo;ll let that slide since they&rsquo;re counting from their last awards. You either fell deeply in love with <em>Dark Souls</em>, or were turned away by its difficulty and ruthlessness. <em>Trials</em> and <em>Journey</em>, while fun and interesting games for their respective platforms, suffer\u00a0as they are Xbox or PS3 only experiences, which limits their total playability -\u00a0the awards are voted for by users, after all.<em>\u00a0Gears of War 3</em>, <em>Uncharted 3</em> and <em>Zelda</em> were also console locked, though the pull of Nintendo&rsquo;s fan-base might push <em>Skyward Sword</em> to a solid second. <em>Assassin&rsquo;s Creed</em> and <em>Arkam City</em> both suffer from being not as good as their predecessors. While both are strong games, they lack a certain something their previous titles had, something along the lines of a certain level of polish, or a\u00a0strong plot.\u00a0<em>Battlefield\u00a03</em>\u00a0and <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, while different takes on the multiplayer shooter, will divide the user base - their fans decry the other while praising their own game. <em>ME3</em>, <em>D3</em> and <em>SWtoR</em> were all strong entries shortly after they came out...which were then forced to change in various ways post release. Thus, by process of elimination, Skyrim, being a well received game across all platforms,\u00a0despite the\u00a0expected Bethesda level bugs, would be the most likely candidate for 'Ultimate Game of the Year'.\n\n<strong>Vladimir Rakhmanin</strong>\n<em>Deputy Online Editor</em>\n<em></em>The fact the <em>Journey </em>is nominated for 'Ultimate Game of the Year' gives me hope\u00a0in\u00a0an\u00a0industry that is filled with grimacing balding space marines. I already ranted\u00a0about this PSN title\u00a0beforehand in a recent review,\u00a0so I'll keep it brief here - Journey is nothing short of magical, and for me personally holds GOTY status with no competition. Whether it will win or not is a whole different question -\u00a0if I had to\u00a0bet on any of the nominations, I would go for Skyrim, simply because it is\u00a0such a massive, open-world title. It's not entirely to my tastes, but it was extremely well-received, so I expect to see a fair share of votes go to this western RPG. I find it interesting that two 3DS titles were nominated - as someone who has owned the console since launch, I was burned by the initial lack of games. It's interesting to see Nintendo turn the situation around in less than two years.\u00a0Personally, I would have gone for <em>Mario Kart 7 </em>as the\u00a03Ds title (I consider it to be the best in the series),\u00a0but\u00a0at the least the handheld system\u00a0is in some way represented.\u00a0Finally,\u00a0I am so very\u00a0happy to see <em>Skyward Sword </em>nominated. I loved the streamlined approach the series took, focusing entirely on the gameplay - certain dungeons that involved time were some of the most genius designs Nintendo have ever concoted.\u00a0I only wish that this\u00a0game had come out five years\u00a0ago,\u00a0sometime closer to the Wii's launch -\u00a0it might have inspired developers to use motion control\u00a0to the same brilliant effects\u00a0as this title.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "12652", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12638", "Heading": "Golden Joystick Awards 2012 - An Analysis"}
