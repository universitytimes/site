University teams might be bullied but they will never be outrun.\u00a0 Trinity went into the break 13-13 all with Jack Carty adding the extras to a try from a rolling maul just before the whistle blew.\u00a0 The second half was more of the same, solid Trinity play building a platform with excellent phase-play before the plan was discarded for something more extravagant and risky.\u00a0 Trinity have some excellent ball carriers in their side.\u00a0 The plaudits generally go to Lavelle and Brian Du Toit for their lung-busting surges into enemy turf.\u00a0 However players such as Hirst, Colin McDonnell, Pierce Dargan and Jack Dilger all bumped around College Park with energy and vitality carrying strongly.\u00a0 Dargan has been one of the Trinity&rsquo;s best forwards this season and was a lone beacon of light against UCD in how he took the fight to them.\n\nTrinity second try was the highlight of the afternoon.\u00a0 A well-worn clich\u00e9 amongst players is how good it feels when something from the training paddock transfer flawlessly to the pitch and Adelokun&rsquo;s try certainly conformed to that.\u00a0 A Trinity lineout saw the ball spun wide to pocket-rocket Ariel Robles who danced around the Buccs midfield before reversing play to where the move started.\u00a0 James cut an arcing run back against the grain.\u00a0 Warren Larkin scythed an impressive decoy line drawing in the Buccaneers players trudging to the direction of play who were now bewildered at Trinity change of direction.\u00a0 O&rsquo;Donoghue then skirted out of a tackle sliding infield to the twenty-two before releasing Niyi Adelokun who turned on the after-burners to finish the move off under the posts.\u00a0 It put Trinity in front and Marsh added a penalty to the conversion to leave the game at 23-16 following another Carty penalty.\n\nHowever Trinity while often causing duress to Buccaneers still managed to let them into the half again.\u00a0 Despite a sterling defensive effort the problems remained with Buccaneers consistently working their way back into scoring range.\u00a0 From Kiripati&rsquo;s surge down the flank, the ball was recycled and Carty rather than exploit the glaring overlap outside, collected the pass, cocked his right leg back and sent a beautiful drop goal sailing between the H.\u00a0 Trinity had learned from McLoughlin&rsquo;s blunder the concept of risk and reward.\u00a0 From the restart they locked Buccaneers into their half and shored up any leaks every man realizing that once you do your job things go according to plan.\u00a0 Trinity will do well to remember that mantra.", "Imageurl": "15185", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Buccs-Trinity3", "ID": "15184", "Heading": "DUFC Overcome Buccaneers"}
