It should have set the tone for the day.\n\nThe second event was the men&rsquo;s novices race the Dan Quinn Shield.\u00a0 This was a classic race complete with drama, tension and even crashes.\u00a0 UCD&rsquo;s crew approaching the O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa Bridge entered the wrong arch, which under the rules was an automatic disqualification. Stewards did not disqualify UCD, as they had been informed of a possible hindrance under this arch. However crucially they had not entered Trinity&rsquo;s arch but rather an unlisted arch which in truth actually extending their distance to the finish line.\u00a0 Despite the error UCD showed their superior fitness as they gradually pulled away from the tiring Trinity crew.\u00a0 To make matters worse, the steering gear on Trinity&rsquo;s boat was causing trouble and eventually gave way seeing Trinity crash into the side bank after the Rory O&rsquo;More Bridge just a few hundred metres from the finish line.\u00a0 It was a cruel blow and one that drew matters level for the course of the day.\u00a0 Despite UCD&rsquo;s misdirected navigation skills they were worthy winners having built up a healthy lead before the Trinity&rsquo;s boat skidded into the granite bank causing considerable damage to the oars and the bow of the boat.\n\nWith the novice races out of the way and the score level at one race a piece the senior teams were up next.\u00a0 Trinity had a relatively inexperienced crew with four racing in their first Colours.\u00a0 Gill Crowe, Georgia Richard, Katie Phelan and cox Niamh Williams were all competing in their first Colours race.\u00a0 UCD by contrast had an exceptionally seasoned team with only two rowers making their senior debut and Siofra Bennett racing in her fourth Colours.\u00a0 Trinity started slowly and while they were in contention up until the Four Courts.\u00a0 The UCD team with its greater experience and tactics marshaled excellently by cox Ciara McGowan began to draw away much to the delight of the swarms of UCD students cycling along the banks of the Liffey cheering on their college.\u00a0 UCD ran out worthy winners by half a length.\u00a0 It was tough for Trinity but with the younger profile of their team there is hope that DULBC can add to their thirteen wins, the last of which was in 2010.\u00a0 With that UCD took the lead in the overall race two-one.\n\nThe Gannon Cup hasn&rsquo;t been a happy hunting ground for DUBC in recent years.\u00a0 They last won the title in 2007 and with UCD strong favourites they needed a superhuman effort to rebalance the days events at the Liffey.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The race started tightly; really tightly.\u00a0 It was a classic, Trinity&rsquo;s team with Will Hurley, Luke Acheson and Patrick Jacques battled hard, but it became very difficult for them.\n\nThe two crews had only half a length between them by the Father Matthew Bridge, however there was a sense that Trinity were only in it due to the benefit of the North Bank.\u00a0 From Mellows Bridge, the UCD crew pulled ahead with every stroke as the Trinity team visibly tired their backs arching with the strain. Every repetition was burning into the sinews of the muscles.\u00a0 Trinity&rsquo;s cox Clementine Yost was audible from both sides of the river urging her charges to make one last push to catch up with the UCD team.\u00a0 However the UCD boat was slowly tipping ahead putting distance between the two crews.\u00a0 The cohesion and precision of the UCD was awesome and seeing the Trinity crew tire seemed to give them extra incentive to pull ahead.\u00a0 They reached the finish line running out winners by twenty metres in a classic boat race that gave the cheering crowds as much entertainment as excitement.\n\nUCD retain that Gannon Cup for the sixth year in a row, all the more remarkable when one considers the number of debutants in their boat.\u00a0 Patrick Moore, Michael Bailey, Adrian Sheehan and Joseph Nihotte all without question will add to their first Colours victory in the future.\u00a0 For Trinity it was another harrowing defeat and it must have been tough for them to see them fall short again.\u00a0 However they can take considerable solace in how well they performed keeping pace with the UCD boat for such a long distance.\u00a0 It would be futile to engage in predictions about the future for Trinity in this race, they still hold the balance of wins thirty-four to thirty and a rivalry will always throw up surprises.\u00a0 One thing is certain is, looking past the tacky commercialism and tackiness of St Patrick&rsquo;s Weekend it would be hard to find a more unique and enjoyable way to celebrate the festivities than by watching the Dublin Boat Race.", "Imageurl": "15441", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15440", "Heading": "UCD win Boat Race Day"}
