Harlequins 20\n\nThe walls of the fortress College Park were last breached and felled in January 2011.\u00a0 Since then all manner of teams have been defeated by the juggernaut DUFC side at their home ground.\u00a0 Records stand to be broken and this defeat to Belfast Harlequins ends the triumphant history of wins quite soberly in the bleak post-festive haze of the New Year.\u00a0 Simply put Trinity did not deserve the win.\u00a0 They clawed their way back into the fixture midway through the second half after playing some turgid rugby against a fired-up and hungry Quins outfit.\u00a0 However the Belfast side had the measure of all aspects of the game.\u00a0 Their scrum and lineout were far superior with Niall Annett showing why he is rated so highly by Ulster&rsquo;s management delivering a superb display.\u00a0 Their work rate typified by their kick-chase and defensive effort were also plain to see.\n\nTrinity need to have all aspects of their set piece functioning to be at their best.\u00a0 They can be effective with one faltering provided the other holds up.\u00a0 They are dire when both go to pot.\u00a0 Their scrum struggled all afternoon with Annett and his cohorts consistently winning the engage, driving Trinity backward.\u00a0 Furthermore DUFC had to wait until the second half to win their first line-out.\u00a0 Warren Larkin looked to have enjoyed the Christmas season too much as his performance was an exercise in complete incompetency.\u00a0 His throwing was inaccurate and wayward, his scrummaging weak.\u00a0 Time and again he was wandering around on the wing outside Neil Hanratty.\u00a0 Furthermore he expended energy petulantly signaling at the officials or celebrating when DUFC won a rare penalty, rather than focus on the task at hand and help his side.\n\nHe was not alone in having a poor performance, with Jack Dilger likewise having an uncharacteristically off colour day making numerous handling errors throughout the game.\u00a0 His number seemed up when off a clearance kick by Stuart Olding, Dilger dropped the ball giving Quins possession with only a few minutes left on the clock.\u00a0 Dilger is a better player than this game and he will naturally bounce back to his normal tenacious and tough self when DUFC travel to Ballynahinch in two weeks.\n\nDUFC were caught on the hop right from kick-off when with only two minutes on the clock Quins outhalf Stuart Olding glided through from his own ten-metre line and ran over for a try that stunned the crowd.\u00a0 He converted his solo effort to make it 7-0.\u00a0 Quins in the first half worked harder.\u00a0 They varied their kicking game with fullback Rory Scholes and scrumhalf Michael Kirkwood mixing play cleverly.\u00a0 They could rely on an excellent kick chase that put Trinity under pressure time and again and with Annett throwing as well as he was, they didn&rsquo;t mind playing out of touch.\u00a0 Trinity spent much of the half camped on their line fighting bloody trench warfare trying to keep Quins out.\u00a0 While Trinity consistently kept out the forays on their line through sheer grit and effort it was not the victories they wanted to be having over their opposition.\u00a0 Too often a raid up the other end of the pitch ended with a damp squib and a concession of possession following either a handling error or just poor ball presentation leading to a turnover.\n\nThe old reliables were as reliable as ever.\u00a0\u00a0 Martin Kelly&rsquo;s play in the loose was encouraging winning some vital turnovers.\u00a0 Jack Kelly also made his way through tackles and rucks like it was nobody&rsquo;s business.\u00a0 Also prominent was debut cap Eoghan Kelly.\u00a0 Trinity are blessed to have awesome depth in terms of opensides at the moment.\u00a0 With Dominic Gallagher still sidelined and Brian Du Toit away, Kelly was called up and did not look out of place well suited to the pace and physicality of Division 1B.\u00a0 However the discrepancy between Trinity&rsquo;s good performers and their wanderers made it easy for Quins to take their lead into the break.\u00a0 Cathal Marsh added a penalty midway through to make it 10-3 at the half.\n\nThe second half steadied the nerves of DUFC with their lineout finally working and their maul putting Quins under pressure.\u00a0 Two penalties from the uber-consistent Marsh made it 10-9 and then Trinity pounced to grab the game by the scruff of the neck.\u00a0 Quins, from a lineout in the Trinity half, shuttled across the backline aimlessly and a great hit by Ciaran Wade on Mark Best saw the ball spill loose.\u00a0 Niyi Adelokun kicked it downfield but over-ran the pick-up.\u00a0 Pierce Dargan, recently named USA Rugby&rsquo;s best overseas player showed good coordination to gather the loose ball and send a kick into the Quins red-zone.\u00a0 Adelokun and Michael McLoughlin put Scholes under pressure and then the arriving Trinity pack drove over the ruck area like a pack of feral dogs winning the ball.\u00a0 Wade fed Marsh who went for a neat show-and-go before offloading to James O&rsquo;Donoghue who scored to make it 16-10 to the home side.\u00a0 Trinity now began to exert greater influence on proceedings.\u00a0 Then the seminal moment came.\n\nWilliam Scott, on for Eoghan Kelly, came through on a garryowen launched by Marsh.\u00a0 Scott and Scholes both competed for the high kick and Scholes fumbled it under pressure from Scott however referee Eddie Hogan O&rsquo;Connell deemed that Scott tackled Scholes off the ball.\u00a0 It was a tough call and one that perhaps warranted at the most a penalty, but a yellow card was issued.\u00a0 Either way Quins made the numerical superiority count with a late try.\u00a0 It was a cruel fate, as Quins seemed to have spurned the opportunity when Paddy Lavelle shunted Mark Kettyle with a hit that saw the ball fly out of his arms.\u00a0 However it fell right into William Stewart&rsquo;s arms and from close range he was never going to miss the line.\u00a0 His try and Olding&rsquo;s subsequent penalty gave Quins a ten-point haul in the space of five minutes.\u00a0 That was simply not good enough and protests and complaints about yellow cards or decisions don&rsquo;t change that it was sloppy and uncharacteristic to concede so many points late on.\u00a0 Not a good start to the New Years by any means for DUFC.\u00a0 Bristol are next in a friendly before Ballynahinch.\u00a0 The real tests begin now.", "Imageurl": "14224", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg",
