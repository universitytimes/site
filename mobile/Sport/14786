It&rsquo;s being hailed as the best opening to a Six Nations tournament in a long time, and I can&rsquo;t help but hope that this has the potential to be a vintage year, The &lsquo;favourites&rsquo; and the defending champions beaten and we have quite the tournament on our hands my friends.\n\nThe build-up to the Six Nations is always pretty exciting- with it comes the spring and our opener against Wales showed an air of freshness and new life in our green machine. It&rsquo;s stating the obvious to say that there was a lot at stake, there always is, but facing the prospect of losing our shot at the slam on the opening weekend, this truly was crunch time for Declan Kidney. For the sake of his position and our credibility, dignity, sanity even, the team needed to pull a performance out of the bag. Did they deliver? Unless you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock somewhere I think you should know the answer to that question.\n\nIreland&rsquo;s early onslaught was somewhat spectacular. The first forty minutes left Irish fans very, very happy and just a little smug- the home crowd didn&rsquo;t have much to sing about (&ldquo;beware the wounded dragon&rdquo; you say, don&rsquo;t think so). If we were happy with Ireland&rsquo;s first half performance however, Wales&rsquo;s arrival in the game in the second half gave us a true spectacle. The intensity was something to behold, you couldn&rsquo;t help but feel privileged to be watching this match.\n\nThe signs were there that such a performance was possible; you need only have looked to the team selection. Kidney&rsquo;s starting fifteen begged the question, have we achieved the right blend of youth and experience that saw us do so well as to win the Grand Slam back in 2009? Despite the loss of Tommy Bowe, nothing excited me more than our new wingers. Though much smaller than their Welsh counterparts the colossal North and Cuthbert, Craig Gilroy and Simon Zebo have the potential to not only rival but surpass these stars of last year&rsquo;s show.\n\nTwinkle-toes Gilroy may not have been afforded many scoring opportunities on Saturday but his brace of hard-hitting tackles shows his worth and I believe should earn him his place against England. As for Zebo, his input into Ireland&rsquo;s second try speaks for itself- what beautiful skill. If you didn&rsquo;t know him before, you will now. My guess is that Simon Zebo will be on every fantasy rugby team in the country after that display. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like that look of shock on the faces of fifteen men wearing red.\n\nThere was however (despite DK&rsquo;s refusal to openly recognise the efforts of just one player- ever the lover of fairness) a real star of this show. Some thought this star may have lost his shine. He more than showed them (ahem George Hook). Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll. His early try in the second half and impressive assist of Zebo&rsquo;s in the first was only half the story. Our former captain&rsquo;s stellar performance showed nothing we haven&rsquo;t seen before, it simply reaffirmed his status as our greatest asset. More of that Trojan work from BOD and we&rsquo;re sure to be living in that exalted state that let&rsquo;s be honest here, only winning and &lsquo;winning good&rsquo; can create- we got a taste for it on Saturday and it is oh so sweet.\n\nBut what of the task facing us on Sunday. As always, there&rsquo;s plenty of work to do and the boys will have to play a very different game against England. Lancaster&rsquo;s team are playing well, simple as. Significantly buoyed by beating the All Blacks and the way in which their clinical performance cast aside the Scots, they have a fair bit of momentum. The Farrell, Sexton battle will be key. It will also be interesting to see whether Lancaster goes with Twelvetrees or Tualagi (if fit) and the game could be won for either side by the power of their centres. All in all it&rsquo;s a tough one to call. It may be premature to call it a title decider but it needn&rsquo;t be said how much the result will dictate the rest of the tournament. Dare I say it&rsquo;s there for the taking? If the prospect of a match like this one against the Auld Enemy doesn&rsquo;t get the pulse racing then there&rsquo;s no hope for excitement in your life.\n\nBut let&rsquo;s not forget the game that really threw this whole thing wide open. Italy have arrived (finally). The outstanding performance of their leader Sergio Parisse and the manner in which they dismantled France&rsquo;s game-plan last Sunday has made them look like a force to be reckoned with. France&rsquo;s defence was disappointing, to say the least. They did nothing short of surrender (something they&rsquo;re regularly accused of) allowing the Italians to find plenty of space outside. \u00a0A win against Scotland this weekend will see Italy go to the top of the table (at least until Sunday) and what a sight that will be to behold.\n\nLast weekend saw some cracking rugby that has left us Irish feeling fairly chuffed. Round two promises to be as good, with two worn-down, disappointed and embarrassed sides facing off, while the true show-down takes place on Sunday. I&rsquo;m guessing it will be hearts in mouths type of stuff, with a bit of jaw dropping thrown in. As ever, pride is at stake, the boys in green have a lot of vengeance seeking to do after last year&rsquo;s display. I don&rsquo;t think DK will be crossing his fingers so I won&rsquo;t bother either, let&rsquo;s give our boys the faith they deserve instead. May the best team win. If you do anything this weekend, choose this drama.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis weekend's winners: Simon Zebo, Brian O'Driscoll, Rory Best, Luciano Orquera, Sergio Parisse, Owen Farrell, Billy Twelvetrees.\n\nand the losers: Pascal Pap\u00e9, Ruaridh Jackson, Jonathon Davies, Richie Gray, Freddie Michalak and when all is said and done, Philippe Saint Andre.", "Imageurl": "14787", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14786", "Heading": "Lead us into Exaltation O BOD"}
