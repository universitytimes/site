{"Body": "On  a glorious spring afternoon, University College Cork midfielder Luke Burgess&rsquo; excellent  finish in extra time was enough to clinch the prestigious Collingwood  Cup for his side.\n\nFor the majority of the final, the outcome looked destined to be  settled by the dreaded penalty shoot out. \u00a0That was until Burgess impressively  swept home the ball from 16 yards, in the 98th  minute, to cap an assured performance. In a game devoid of  control and finesse, but typically rich in desire, pride and hearty  tackles, the low strike was remarkable for its immaculate composure.\n\nHaving  beaten defending champions and bitter rivals UCD in a closely-fought  semi-final, UCC went into the match full of confidence. \u00a0However NUI Galway, whose presence in the final may have baffled some, undoubtedly  lived up to expectation, commendably playing their part in a closely  fought final. \u00a0Although the 2011 final will live short in the memory of  the crowd assembled at College Park, with neither team having many clear  chances, it is a momentous victory for UCC that wrestles the title away  from the clutches of UCD.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1983\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"UCC celebrate a well earned victory\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/185902_166645073385902_159711747412568_387174_2027203_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1983\" title=\"185902_166645073385902_159711747412568_387174_2027203_n\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/185902_166645073385902_159711747412568_387174_2027203_n-300x211.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"211\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nNeither  team seemed particularly keen to commit numbers forward during a tense  first half. \u00a0 Cork had an early penalty claim controversially waved  away by referee Richie Glynn.\u00a0 Galway keeper Keane seemingly brought  down the lively Josh O&rsquo;Shea after fumbling a cross, provoking fury from  the Cork bench.\u00a0 Winger Rob Waters, arguably Cork&rsquo;s most gifted  player, provided width and purpose, persistently driving at the  opposition defence.\n\nGalway left-back Browne, lacking speed of thought  and fleet of foot, endured a torrid time against Waters and was  subsequently replaced at half time. Yet Galway had the best effort of  the first period. Coming on the half hour mark, Mikey Creane, drifting  in from the left, curled a beautiful effort narrowly wide, much to the  dismay of the NUIG bench.\n\nHaving  finished the first half in the ascendancy, Cork began where they had  left off, but immediately they were caught on the break. \u00a0O&rsquo;Doherty&rsquo;s  precise pass was collected by Lee, who despite rounding the keeper; saw  his effort cleared off the line by the imperious Cork defence. Moments  later, Cork&rsquo;s McHenry was again tested, smartly saving low to his left  from Brian Conlon.\n\nAs  the game progressed, Cork began to exert a measure of control. On 60  minutes, Brian Gaffney was responsible for missing an excellent  opportunity following great work by the impressive Waters. Substitute Kilcommons wasted an excellent opportunity in the final  minute of normal time, dragging his shot into the side netting, albeit  from a tight angle.\n\nAs  tempers frayed, the emotional and physical stress of four consecutive  matches was unmistakable in both teams. \u00a0Referee Glynn had to speak to  both benches during the closing stages of normal time, urging restraint.\n\nIt wasn&rsquo;t until the 8th  minute of extra time that the deadlock was broken by Burgess.\u00a0 Wild  celebrations ensued, with the entirety of the Cork bench &lsquo;mobbing&rsquo; the  Cork goalscorer. \u00a0Galway desperately searched for an equaliser and  moments later they almost levelled. \u00a0The ball broke fortuitously for  Brian Conlon in the penalty box, yet he lacked composure, smashing his  effort straight at McHenry. \u00a0As the sun set behind Dublin, Galway  continued to press, sending forward their centre backs. \u00a0\u00a0Still, they  were unable to penetrate the imperious Cork defence, marshalled superbly  by captain Michael Mc Sweeney.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1984\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Luke Burgess&#39; winning goal proved to be the difference between the two sides\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/184274_166645050052571_159711747412568_387173_7013939_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1984 \" title=\"184274_166645050052571_159711747412568_387173_7013939_n\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/184274_166645050052571_159711747412568_387173_7013939_n-300x209.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"209\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nThe  final was a tight affair, decided by a rare moment of composure and  energy from Burgess. Cork, on the balance of play were deserved  winners - just. \u00a0As Cork collected their medals, Galway reflected on  what might have been. For many of their players, this was their last  opportunity to win the Collingwood Cup. Coach Bill Clery was equally  despondant, bemoaning his side&rsquo;s ill fortune. \u00a0His disappointment was  more than evident, simply insisting that &lsquo;his team will be back again  next year&rsquo;.\n\nWatching  his captain, Mc Sweeney, lift the trophy, Cork manager John Caulfield  expressed his joy. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m delighted, it&rsquo;s the first time we&rsquo;ve won it in  6 years, which has been far too long. \u00a0We have won this tournament the  hard way by playing all the best teams, including defending champions  UCD in the semi final. \u00a0Having played 4 games in as many days, I  expected the game to be scrappy. We knew one goal might be enough to  win the game and luckily Luke stepped up to score the winner. It&rsquo;s his  second this week and i&rsquo;m happy for him on a personal level. \u00a0He&rsquo;s a very  capable footballer and an unsung hero of this team. \u00a0He rarely gives  the ball away and it was an excellent finish. Luke, like all the boys,  has been a pleasure to work with. &lsquo;\n\nJosh  O&rsquo;Shea, UCC forward and winner of &lsquo;Player of the Tournament&rsquo;, echoed  his manager&rsquo;s thoughts. \u00a0&lsquo;We showed great heart by beating all the top  teams. \u00a0It was a great goal and we&rsquo;re all looking forward to taking the  cup back to Cork to celebrate!&rsquo; \u00a0Alas, Trinity could not win on home  soil. \u00a0On the bright side, we were saved from the ignominy of a  victorious UCD team. \u00a0Congratulations - and thank you Cork!", "Imageurl": "1984", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1971", "Heading": "UCC take Collingwood Cup at the death"}
