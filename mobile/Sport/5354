Run by BUSC (the British Universities Snow Sports Council), BUDs sees over 1000 competitors every year and WE WANT YOU!\n\nWe will be traveling over on the 12<sup>th</sup> and returning on the 15<sup>th</sup> so there&rsquo;s no need to worry about missing college because it&rsquo;s on over Reading Week (well, unless you&rsquo;re in one of the Health Sciences, in which case you could probably do with a few days off anyways). The event is for skiiers and boarders <strong>of all standards</strong> and spectators are more than welcome. In fairness though, you have nothing to lose by competing, well apart from your dignity, but being a student you&rsquo;ve most likely lost that many times over.\n\nAccommodation is organised through BUDs and we will be staying in a hostel in the centre of Edinburgh, which gives good access to the world&rsquo;s longest dry slope where the event is being held as well as Edinburgh&rsquo;s killer nightlife.\n\nSpectator price for the trip is &euro;115 which includes;\n\n-3 nights accommodation\n\n-spectator fee\n\n-club night\n\n-gate crasher ticket to the Black Tie Ball\n\nAll you have to do is find a way to get there! Fly, sail or run if you like, we leave that up to you, but Ryanair do some pretty good deals on flights if you&rsquo;re not the running type.\n\nIf you are interested in competing, it will cost an extra 45GBP but that usually will be funded by DUCAC and plus, you get to have the honour of representing your college and who doesn&rsquo;t want that kind of fame? Maybe they&rsquo;ll even mention you by name in the University Times after it, at which point you know you&rsquo;ve made it in life.\n\nIf you are in anyway interested, there will be a DUSnowSports stand up in the Arts Block this Monday and Tuesday from 12-3pm so come along and find out what all the hype is about and what the competition entails.\n\nGo on, you know you want to.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>More info available @ http://www.buscevents.com/events/index.php/?content=965&amp;menu=2498</em>", "Imageurl": "5355", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5354", "Heading": "Got Ski?"}
