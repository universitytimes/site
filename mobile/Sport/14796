24\n\nDungannon &ndash; 16\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHenry Campbell-Bannerman once asked &lsquo;when is a war not a war?&rsquo; in relation to British military conduct during the Second Boer War.\u00a0 The players of Dublin University Football Club might just be asking when is a win not a win.\u00a0 Trinity bounced back to winning ways following three successive defeats.\u00a0 However the missed opportunity in not securing a bonus point left them with a bitter taste and in foul mood.\u00a0 Such reactions are solely natural.\u00a0 The weak manner in which DUFC defended, the missing of countless tackles and allowing Dungannon RFC back into the game from a position of being ten points ahead, were hard to take.\u00a0 The former is fixable, the latter in inexcusable.\n\nTrinity were not for the first time this season out of sorts.\u00a0 The fixture was played in Merrion Road due to the state of College Park, which resembled the Somme following a heavy artillery barrage.\u00a0 The pitch they played on was firmer, faster and wider than their normal home, yet they struggled to take advantage of it.\u00a0 Trinity started well.\u00a0 The addition of new hooker Cameron Falcon from Louisiana State University and America U20s, as well as the return of Shawn Pittman following his Christmas break has given Trinity truly excellent impact from the bench and really viable alternatives to the starting incumbents.\u00a0 Both were introduced just before the half-time break and used their power and heft to good effect to wear down the Dungannon pack.\u00a0 Trinity had a solid first half with tries from the ever reliable and durable Pierce Dargan and thanks to good work from Ian Hirst, Warren Larkin and Martin Kelly; Trinity bagged a penalty try for a scrum infringement on the Dungannon line.\u00a0 David Joyce added the brace of conversions to put Trinity eight-ahead at the break.\n\nThe start of the second-half started in similarly gung-ho fashion.\u00a0 Ariel Robles, on for Ciaran Wade, brought an injection of pace into the midfield and James O&rsquo;Donoghue kicked sharply and accurately.\u00a0 O&rsquo;Donoghue looks close to full form and this is surely crucial for DUFC with some tough fixtures around the corner.\u00a0 The ex-Terenure fullback has a howitzer-like left-foot that is both accurate and educated.\u00a0 Jack Kelly bagged his sides third try from a lineout to bring Trinity within one try of the much-coveted bonus point.\n\nBut it never came.\u00a0 Trinity tried and tried and then tried some more.\u00a0 They tried to go through Dungannon, they tried to go behind them, they tried to go around them, yet for all that it was the visitors who scored next, and again after that to bring the game to 21-16, and leave Trinity ruing the inability to shut the game out.\u00a0 Trinity spent the final few minutes launching a few unsuccessful sorties into the Dungannon &rsquo;22 searching for the bonus point.\u00a0 The game ended on Trinity conceding a penalty while hunting for a fourth try.\u00a0 As such the natural reaction immediately following such an ending is one of frustration and disappointment.\u00a0 This shouldn&rsquo;t be the case.\u00a0 Simple use of perspective will show that Trinity won the match, obtained no injuries, ending a losing streak and strengthened the status of their squad by having the replacements make such a fulsome impact on the score line.\u00a0 It is valid to investigate the argument that the continual use of substitutions affects the flow and rhythm of the team, as well as the player themselves.\u00a0 However there isn&rsquo;t much point in having a strong squad if you don&rsquo;t use it.\u00a0 The defensive errors can be solved with some work.\n\nThe sombre post match reflection from both players and coaches was evident.\u00a0 Tony Smeeth&rsquo;s stark appraisal may have had some players confused about the result in a game that Trinity were reputed to have won.\u00a0 At least according to the score kept by the independent officials.\u00a0 A win is important, as is scope for reflection.\u00a0 A handy bonus point win may have lifted spirits but glossed over the intricate details and lessons of the three successive losses.\u00a0 Trinity must take full value from the lessons gained from those defeats.\u00a0 An easy win bringing things back to normal may have neglected the necessary post mortem.\u00a0 Hide the body, display the bonus point, and learn nothing.\u00a0 Trinity return to winning ways and while the aura of invincibility may be damaged it is not destroyed.\u00a0 Trinity will still have a big say on how this league ends up.", "Imageurl": "14797", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Dungannon3", "ID": "14796", "Heading": "Trinity Stop the Rot against Dungannon"}
