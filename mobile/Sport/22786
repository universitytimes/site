{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Amy Codd</strong> | Ladies Football Correspondent</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In attempting to capitalise on the success of the previous season, TCD Ladies Football teams progressed further than previously in their current divisions this year, but didn&rsquo;t quite reach their target potential, as both teams ultimately aim to challenge for the top positions in their respective leagues; Divisions 2 and 4.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The senior team reached the semi-final of their league, beginning their campaign with a narrow defeat to Athlone IT (AIT). Despite a strong start from TCD in this game, coordinated defending from AIT prevented TCD establishing a comfortable lead, and AIT fought back in the second half to win by five points. Trinity demonstrated a clear recovery from this unfavourable start to the league with a comprehensive dispatch of DCU&rsquo;s 2nds, putting the game out of sight of their opponents within the first half. TCD achieved their most hard fought victory against last year&rsquo;s Giles Cup winners NUI Maynooth. In this game TCD came back from a six point half-time deficit with crucial second half goals from Sinead O&rsquo;Sullivan and Maebh Downey. End to end attacks throughout the game meant the result was uncertain until the last minutes of the game; strong defending from Amie Giles and Michelle Peel denied Maynooth a winning score, progressing TCD to the next stage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">TCD faced Carlow IT (ITC) in the semi-final of the league, a game which they poured great energy into, with a Lucy Mulhall goal getting them off to a positive start. Trinity lead the first half, although an ever threatening ITC clawed their way back into the game in the second half and overhauled TCD to eventually claim victory. The senior team will take from their league campaign encouragingly skilled play against NUI Maynooth and fighting spirit against ITC in their preparation for the Giles Cup in 2014, in which they will face many of the teams they encountered in the league.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Museo_Slab_500_2'; font-style: normal; font-size: 140%; line-height: 120%; text-align: center; width: 40%; background: #8F1163; color: white; float: right; padding: 32px 22px 32px 22px; margin: 5px 0px 0px 20px;\">The competitiveness of the team TCD entered into the Division 4 league this season is a continuing example of the growth the club has enjoyed in the past number of years</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The competitiveness of the team TCD entered into the Division 4 league this season is a continuing example of the growth the club has enjoyed in the past number of years. The club&rsquo;s 2nds reached the quarter final of their league, beginning their season with a relished victory over rivals UCD 3rds. Freshers Roisin Boyce and Ailbhe Finnerty displayed great skills in the game, while Aoife Kavanagh commanded the midfield. The team then drew against St. Pats 2nds, having led for most of the game with Siofra Mulkerrin dominating midfield. In the second half, the St. Pats countered quickly and they almost overtook Trinity with the final attack of the game. Fortunately, the composure of TCD&rsquo;s full back line kept them from defeat. They demonstrated their desire to put that close call behind them in a convincing victory over AIT 2nds but were unprepared for the step up, when they faced University of Ulster, Jordanstown and were outclassed in their league quarter-final. The team will incorporate aspects of each of the results they experienced in the league to prepare for the Donaghy Cup. Their experience in the quarter-final, although negative, will set the standard they wish to perform at during their championship encounters.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ladies Football in Trinity has seen its largest sign-up so far this year. The progression of the senior team has finally awarded them the chance to contest the Giles Cup for the first time. The seconds&rsquo; team have established themselves as contenders in their league and championship competition and, as individuals, the players also make their presence known as competition for inclusion on the senior team.</p>\r\nA number of Trinity Ladies Footballers also line out at county level, representing Longford, Cavan, Wicklow and Westmeath to name but a few. This year saw Caitriona Smith included on the Cavan team which won the Intermediate Ladies Football All Ireland Final and Lucy Mulhall and Jacinta Brady have also each received prestigious Sports Scholarships. All members of the ladies football club are now switching their focus from their league campaigns to their respective championships, in which the standard, at the later stages of the season, will be particularly high. This will only serve to drive the teams to excel and push each other at training and exhibit their ability on the high stakes match days.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tmc.png", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22786", "Heading": "Progressive Season for Ladies GAA Teams"}
