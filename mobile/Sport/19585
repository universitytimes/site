{"Body": "The League of Ireland is reaching its climax over the coming weeks but nothing is settled at this late stage. The league title is everything but sewn up as the most open title race in recent years still rumbles on. While down the other end of the table, numerous teams are still fighting for survival. The 2013 season has well and truly proven that in this league anybody can beat anybody, providing Irish football enthusiasts with an intriguing season from start to finish.\r\n\r\nWith five games left to play, St. Patricks Athletic are in the driving seat to end their 14 year wait for a league title, their last coming back in 1999. Their recent victory in Inchicore over closest challengers Dundalk has put Liam Buckley's side three points and in some regards, the title is theirs to lose. They have two important home fixtures against Sligo and Derry over the coming weeks which should decide whether they lift their 8th league trophy or not.\r\n\r\nSurprise package, Dundalk, find themselves in 2nd but will rue their missed opportunity to beat Pats last week and go top. Stephen Kenny has built a young and hungry team which has vastly exceeded expectations. The Lilywhites will still believe they can recover the three point gap with five games to play. With a cup semi-final against local rivals Drogheda to come, Dundalk will be delighted with their season thus far, even if the title is out of their grasp.\r\n\r\nThe 2012 champions, Sligo currently lie in third. They began the season at a blistering pace with eight straight wins but a mid-season slump has cost them, particularly their two losses to fellow challengers Dundalk. They are five points off the pace which is by no means an insurmountable task. Their meeting with leaders Pats on October 12th will be crucial as to whether they have any chance of bringing the title west again.\r\n\r\nAs with any league, as the season draws to a close there are teams sitting safely mid-table. Derry City, Shamrock Rovers, Drogheda United, Cork City and Limerick make up that contingent.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"642\"]<img id=\"irc_mi\" style=\"margin-top: 31px;\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://img.rasset.ie/0007594c-642.jpg\" width=\"642\" height=\"361\" /> Shamrock Rovers won the Setanta Cup with a convincing 7-1 final victory[/caption]\r\n\r\nPre-season favourites Shamrock Rovers will be concerned that they didn't mount even the faintest of title challenges and their recent loss against fierce rivals Bohemians will bitterly hurt. They can draw solace from their performances in the cup competitions, picking up the Setanta Cup and EA Sports Cup. Trevor Croly will be firmly focused on his team's semi-final against Sligo in hope of completing a hat-trick of domestic cups.\r\n\r\nDrogheda and Cork will be annoyed at their inability to push on from decent performances last season and this may be reflected in the fact that both side will begin next season with new men in charge. Tommy Dunne was sacked by the Cork board in August and replaced by Stuart Ashton on a caretaker basis. While &ldquo;The Drogs&rdquo; have decided they will not be renewing Mick Cooke's contract for the 2014 season due to differing views on the future direction of the club.\r\n\r\nLooking into the bottom four, only six points separate 9th placed UCD and bottom side Shelbourne so anything could happen over the final weeks. UCD can possibly lay claim to being the most inconsistent side in the league, with victories away in Derry and at Tallaght Stadium showing they can beat anyone on their day. Their match against bottom of the table Shels on the last day of the season could be of the utmost of importance as it's certain this will go down to the wire.\r\n\r\nBohemians, champions as recently as 2008, have never been relegated but have languished around the foot of the table all season. However, under new manager Owen Heary, Bohs are in their best form of the season. Recent victories over fellow strugglers Bray and Shels were of huge importance, as was their 1-0 win over rivals Shamrock Rovers.\r\n\r\nBray Wanderers have performed as expected this season. Jason Byrne returned as their saviour in some regards but even his experience may not be enough to keep the Wicklow side up. Their fixture at Dalymount against Bohemians is massive and anything but a win will probably condemn them to at least a relegation play-off.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"587\"]<img id=\"irc_mi\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.universityobserver.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/afc.jpeg\" width=\"587\" height=\"422\" /> Shelbourne, in action against UCD, have had a dismal season. Photo: University Observer[/caption]\r\n\r\nShelbourne are in serious trouble. Their home loss to Bohemians last week looks to have cost them dearly as they now lie five points off safety, a very difficult margin to overcome in their recent form. They've lost their last five and it's unlikely that will change anytime soon.\r\n\r\nThe Airtricity League is at the height of excitement at this point with the league title still swaying between Pats, Sligo and Dundalk while the relegation battle is poised for an intriguing finale. Most reckon it's Pats&rsquo; title to lose while Shelbourne and Bray have a lot to do to save themselves. Going by how this season has gone, it&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s guess. Either way, it's going to be exciting finish.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/St-Pats.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19585", "Heading": "League of Ireland Going Down to the Wire"}
