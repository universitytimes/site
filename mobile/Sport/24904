{"Body": "<strong>Conor Bates |\u00a0</strong>Sports Editor\r\n\r\nAfter careening through the group stages of the CUFL Division 1 Cup, silverware appeared to be distinct possibility for Trinity&rsquo;s football team. Following a comprehensive 2-0 victory over NUI Galway in the quarter final, the team travelled to Cork in the final days of January. Once again, DUAFC overcame their opponents, Colaiste Stiofain Naofa, albeit in more dramatic fashion on this occasion. A 2-2 draw, with goals coming from Farhad Patel and Pablo Garzon, saw the semi-final go into the ultimate determinant; penalties. After all ten outfielders had taken their penalties, the score stood at 7-7. Trinity&rsquo;s spirits were lifted as goalkeeper, David Minihane, found the net from twelve yards out. Minihane then cemented his place as the hero of the day by saving the opposition &lsquo;keeper&rsquo;s strike, sending his team triumphantly through to the final; an encounter with reigning champions, IT Carlow.\r\n\r\nFebruary proved to be a less kind month for the men&rsquo;s footballers. Leixlip Stadium played host to the final, which had to be abandoned at the first instance. During the first iteration of the final, the infamous hurricane season got the better of the occasion, with the referee deciding to abandon proceedings at half-time. At 0-0, the game was ruled a no-contest and rescheduled for the following week. Once again, some resolute defending saw Trinity reach the half without conceding, but the second half would not be so favourable. A deflected Colm Poole shot left Minihane with little chance, and Carlow took the lead in the 52<sup>nd</sup> minute. Despite the best efforts of Gus Shaw Stewart and Brian O&rsquo;Reilly, among others, the scoreline remained 1-0, and IT Carlow retained their trophy. This proved to be a disappointing end to the cup run which had seemed so promising from the off. It is ultimately hard to argue with Carlow&rsquo;s victory on the day, but over the course of the competition, there was very little to choose between the sides, and the cup could have returned to Trinity as easily as not. All things considered, the real positive to take from this cup is promotion back to the Premier Division of the CUFL, for next season.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_24908\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Collingwood.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-24908\" alt=\"Trinity were knocked out of the main Collingwood draw by UCC.

Photo: Ed Scannell[/caption]\r\n\r\nThe centenary Collingwood Cup was undoubtedly the jewel in the crown of the university footballing calendar, and DUAFC would look to bounce back from the disappointment of the previous week. Their opening game, a quarter-final clash against UCC, however, would be the first and final game for them in the main draw. An irrepressible UCC side found the net three times, shocking Trinity, who brought little to the table in the way of attacking prowess. The defeat saw DUAFC exit the Collingwood Cup competition, and enter the ancillary shield tournament, the Farquhar Cup. In the other realms of the main draw, NUI Maynooth pulled off a surprise victory against hosts and holders UCD, meaning they too would drop down to the Farquhar tier. In traditional cup football fashion, Trinity were drawn against UCD, setting up a tantalising impromptu Colours game the following day.\r\n\r\nAs if things couldn&rsquo;t have gotten any worse for DUAFC, the hosts took the lead with a goal from Brian O&rsquo;Brochlain. With the hurt of losing to Cork still fresh in the Trinity minds, this goal seemed to boost the team, who upped their game significantly, digging in in defence and pushing forward more decisively on the attack. Club captain, Conor Bobbett, registered an equaliser before half-time to carry Trinity into the second half with a reward for their renewed vigour. Trinity redoubled their effort in the second half and the definitive moment arrived courtesy of the boot of Colm Begley, making the score 2-1. Trinity held out defiantly until the end, setting up a Farquhar Cup final match against Jordanstown University.\r\n\r\nThe trend of close but no cigar reared its head on the final day of the Collingwood festivities, as far as Trinity were concerned. Three matches in three days would take their toll on the players, as they found themselves on the wrong side of a whopping 4-1 scoreline. Finals have evidently not been the friend of DUAFC in recent times, and this was once again the case, as UUJ opened their account in the 30<sup>th</sup> minute. The Ulster side took the score to 3-0 after half-time, before Trinity could register a consolation response, through midfielder, Liam Ware.\r\n\r\nThe positives DUAFC will take from this year&rsquo;s CUFL, Collingwood and Farquhar Cups may be hard to recognise at first, while the burden of defeat lingers. Although no trophy will make its way back to Trinity from any of the DUAFC cup campaigns, the reaching of two finals is not to be smirked at. Similarly, the performances required to attain the runners-up positions were admirable and strong; if they can be repeated for the remainder of the league campaign, there may be more to smile about soon.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Soccer-Bobbo-640x427.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24904", "Heading": "No Gold Rush for DUAFC"}
