With the arrival of the 1920&rsquo;s, controversy arose as the British government became unhappy with Scotland&rsquo;s co-operation with the GAA disapproving of their perceived anti-British viewpoint and the international series was put on hiatus.

So, here we are in 2011, keeping the tradition alive, despite the freezing weather.\n\nI was immediately struck by how similar Shinty and Hurling are. Save for a slight difference in stick, team size and a few rules, one could easily place a Shinty player in a Kilkenny jersey and swear he was from Ballyhale. In fact, some of the Edinburgh team hail from Kingussie Shinty club, Scotland&rsquo;s equivalent of Kilkenny. Shinty-Hurling is the only sport in the world without any dedicated clubs or leagues.\u00a0 So, for the students that took part in the inter-varsity challenge it was quite an opportunity.
