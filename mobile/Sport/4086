New Zealand&rsquo;s 41-10 win flatters both teams and neither at the same time. All in all, his contest epitomised the clich\u00e9 of a game of two halves.</div>\n<div>\nThe opening ceremony, normally a dragged out bore of cultural propaganda, actually brought the crowd into the game nicely, as it illustrated the history of the Maori culture with impressive shows of singing and dancing.</div>\n<div>The Haka war dance, performed by the All Blacks, and Tonga's Sipi Tau, struck a match which set the atmosphere alight in Eden Park, Auckland, and the New Zealanders came out with their tails up. Dan Carter slotted a penalty within 90 seconds of the kick-off, and within seven minutes centres Ma&rsquo;a Nonu and Sonny-Bill Williams combined to send fullback Israel Dagg over for the first try of the 2011 campaign.</div>\n<div>Five minutes later and it was a 15-point lead, as Williams and Toeava combined to send winger Richie Kahui over in the opposite corner .The inclusion of Williams and Dagg, for which All Black coach Graham Henry came under some criticism, was proving a winning formula. The Canterbury Crusaders-themed backline was picking their shots with unerring precision.</div>\n<div>The undersized yet undervalued New Zealand front five held strong against a tough Tongan pack. Hooker Andrew Hore and irrepressible captain Richie McCaw caused continuous Tongan headaches at the breakdown.</div>\n<div>\n\nDagg and Kahui each got another try before half-time as both after Toeava and Williams combined with more excellent passing and line-running. Mercurial out-half Carter managed 75%of his kicks, but it was Williams who ran the show and Conrad Smith would be lucky to play again.\n\nAs good as New Zealand were in the opening 40 minutes, however, Tonga were equally poor. There was a lack of fire and resilience about the Islanders, something which\u00a0we've come to\u00a0expect from them. Everybody was singing All Black praises at half time; New Zealand seconds could beat Tonga. Strike that, New Zealand seconds could beat most teams.\n\nThe second half wasn&rsquo;t just a different story, but a different genre entirely. The style of rugby changed, Tongan tackling improved considerably, and New Zealand had to work harder to keep the ball. There was no whiz on the ball, everything was being done a little bit slower, very uncharacteristic of New Zealand. The New Zealanders don&rsquo;t like defenders running at them.\n\n15 minutes into the second half, New Zealand still haven&rsquo;t scored, despite several opportunities. Williams mucks an overlap chance, Kahui drops a pass. Things start to turn away from the number one side in the world.\n\nA lapse in concentration from a scrum - and some fantastic hands from Kahui - leads to blindside flanker Jerome Kaino going over between the posts. Carter misses the standard conversion, then gets levelled going backwards. He is promptly substituted. More tireless Tongan perseverance leads to a series of scrums, at the end of which substitute prop Alisona Taumalolo rumbles over for a consolation try.\n\nThe All Blacks brought Tonga roughly back to earth with the pick of the tries, 3 minutes from time. Nonu combines brilliantly with Carter&rsquo;s replacement Colin Slade to run over from 60 meters.\n\nGeorge Clancy calls an end to the game, which gives New Zealand a 41-10 win at the final whistle. Seven tries, a spirited Tongan second half performance, and a man of the match goes to the Limerick man Clancy as referee, for penalising the New Zealanders ten times at the breakdown. Enough entertainment there for the impartial supporter, but with improvements needed in rugby standards for most people to be satisfied entirely.\n\nWhoever coined the phrase 'stats don't lie' clearly never watched the All Blacks play; Tonga had more possession, territory, and ball in the opposition 22.\u00a0As a contest, however, it was over after the Haka was finished.\n\n</div>", "Imageurl": "4087", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4086", "Heading": "A Black out for Tonga"}
