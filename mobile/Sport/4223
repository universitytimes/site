The score was facilitated by a\u00a0devastating\u00a0missed tackle on Jacque Fourie, captain Sam Warburton the culprit.\n\n'Problems? What problems?', asked Morne Steyn as he belied the tournament's place-kicking woes to convert from the touchline.\n\nWales employed familiar tactics in keeping the ball in hand and moving their opponents all around the pitch, but could only manage two penalties from James Hook in reward.\n\nControversially, another Hook penalty was called wide by referee Wayne Barnes when TV replays, not consulted in making the decision, indicated that the ball may have crept inside the far post above the area marked out by the posts.\n\nThe first half ended at 10-6 to South Africa, but Wales had been on top in the ruck and more than matched their brawny opponents in the scrum and line-out.\n\nBoth sides were intent on perpetrating goal-line assaults on the restart, with Shane Williams' typical touchline dash setting the platform for Mike Phillips to play a poor pass to Toby Faletau with the try line gaping. Opportunity: dead.\n\nGalvanised by the injury-enforced replacements of Victor Matfield and Jean de Villiers, Wales launched another siege on the Springbok line. 2009 Lion Jamie Roberts crashed into the unyielding defensive wall to set a platform for Faletau to make the wall yield. The Television Match Official confirmed the touchdown.\n\nFlanker Dan Lydiate was a liability for Wales, giving away numerous costly penalties. South Africa capitalised on his indiscipline to make ground and replacement Hougaard ran through a broken Welsh defense unopposed. Steyn's conversion from under the posts put his side one point ahead with ten minutes to go.\n\nPriestland missed a glorious opportunity to bag a drop-goal, hooking wide from directly in front of the posts. When Hougaard conceded a penalty on the counter-attack, Hook could not manage to convert from a tight angle and the Springboks reached the finishing line battered, bloody, but unbeaten.\n\nTo their credit, the Welsh management team are yet to blame Barnes' disallowing of Hook's penalty for their defeat. The experienced cast know that, had they taken their chances like a top-class side should, the decision wouldn't have mattered after 80 minutes.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "4224", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "4223", "Heading": "Wales push world champion Springboks all the way"}
