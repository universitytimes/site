{"Body": "In the space of an average week in the National Football League, heroes fall, legends become immortalised, and previous unknowns bolt from obscurity to centre stage. Last week&rsquo;s wildcard playoff matchups proved once again that if there&rsquo;s a competition out there with the capacity to engineer endless surprises, it&rsquo;s the NFL.\r\n\r\n<b>Last Week&rsquo;s Recap</b>\r\n\r\nAndrew Luck further bolstered his credentials as not only a credible alternative for Indianapolis&rsquo; living deity Peyton Manning, but as his true heir to the throne. If his career continues on its current arc, he can look forward to achieving a status of reverence in Colt Country presently reserved only for Manning. His career highlight comeback victory over Kansas City was nothing short of incredible. Taking his team from the pits of despair, when they trailed 38-10 just after half-time, to playoff victory shows off one of his most valuable traits; the ability to shrug off negativity and focus purely on what is in front of him.\r\n\r\nKansas City&rsquo;s exit at this stage can only serve to heighten frustrations after a promising start to the season. Scoring 44 points should see any team to the next round, but nothing is certain. When the Colts started gaining momentum and turning it into points, the Chiefs demise became inevitable.\r\n\r\nSan Diego have proven themselves to be a team with substance. Their improbable entry into the playoffs has been vindicated, with victory over the Bengals. The Chargers seem to be an unknown entity capable of causing another shock before their season is called to a halt.\r\n\r\nCincinnati&rsquo;s inability to convert regular season consistency into post-season success will lead to Andy Dalton bearing the brunt of the criticism. The Bengals QB has thrown just a single touchdown pass in three post-season games. With such sub-par stats, it will be interesting to see what Cincinnati&rsquo;s next move will be regarding the position.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"597\"]<img class=\"irc_mut\" id=\"irc_mi\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://media.nola.com/tpphotos/photo/2014/01/14041406-standard.jpg\" width=\"597\" height=\"421\" /> New Orleans overcame Philadelphia, to set up a tie with the Seahawks.[/caption]\r\n\r\nNew Orleans ground out a tough road victory against Philadelphia, with kicker Shayne Graham proving to be a cool head under pressure, kicking a 32-yard game winner three seconds from time. This win breaks New Orleans playoff curse, having previously never won a post-season road game apart from Superbowl XLIV, which was played at a neutral venue.\r\n\r\nSan Francisco&rsquo;s matchup with Green Bay, billed as the tie of the round, was played in Arctic temperatures, yet the strength of play shone through and the conditions did not hamper either team as much as they should have. San Francisco made a game defining goal-line stop, allowing only a field-goal to leave it tied at twenty with five minutes remaining. They held onto possession for the remainder of the game, moving the chains methodically, before kicking the game-winner. Kaepernick proved his tremendous worth once again, securing a third straight victory over the Packers. He combined his pace and strength on the ground with his cannon arm to propel the 49er&rsquo;s past Green Bay in the playoffs for the second season in succession. With the wildcard games completed, the divisional round matchups begin tonight.\r\n\r\n<b>New Orleans v Seattle</b>\r\n\r\nThe Saints will travel to Seattle with still festering wounds after their 34-7 dismantling earlier in the season. Seattle seem dead certs in many experts&rsquo; eyes to make the Superbowl, especially since they secured home field advantage throughout the playoffs. A resilient New Orleans however, buoyed by victory over the Eagles, will seek revenge in this battle of the quarterbacks. Russell Wilson has oft been compared to Drew Brees due to their similar diminutive stature. Brees has shown that smaller men can play, and thrive in the position.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans are a strong team and their game management against Philly last week was smart, but Seattle are a different animal entirely. Seattle do have some small weaknesses though, mainly in the offensive line, with injuries hampering them throughout the season. Their receiving core has also taken some criticism, but with the potential return of Percy Harvin, the Seahawks look like the full package in the NFC. A Saints victory is not entirely inconceivable, but it is unlikely. Seattle have passed virtually every test thrown at them with flying colours, and it will take a mammoth effort to beat them at home. Their week 16 loss at home to the Cardinals could yet prove a blessing in disguise. The loss may have served as the reminder they needed that winning at home is not a given right. This will be a very tough football game, but the Seahawks should prevail.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"594\"]<img class=\"irc_mut\" id=\"irc_mi\" style=\"margin-top: 12px;\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://www2.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Julian+Edelman+Indianapolis+Colts+v+New+Engalnd+LSSp6SFBFb3l.jpg\" width=\"594\" height=\"397\" /> New England's Julian Edelman (11) has proven his mettle against the colts before.[/caption]\r\n\r\n<b>Indianapolis v New England</b>\r\n\r\nSaturday&rsquo;s AFC game sees Indianapolis face New England. The Patriots are perennial playoff contenders, and without question have the strongest Head Coach-Quarterback combination in the league. New England made the playoffs, collecting a bye in the process, after suffering several tremendous setbacks throughout the regular season. With the loss of their front-line receiving core for the majority, in some cases all, of the season, coupled with injuries to key defensive players, New England should not be where they are right now. This team refuses to yield and will welcome Indianapolis, confident in the knowledge they can get it done once again.\r\n\r\nTom Brady has not lit it up as sensationally as in previous years, but the ruthless and determined streak within him has never been more evident, and he has dragged his team to where he feels they rightfully belong for the eleventh time in his career.\r\n\r\nIndianapolis have their own talisman in Andrew Luck. They will seek a second miracle in a week as they hope to claim a victory. The Colts have now adequately filled the void left by the injured veteran Reggie Wayne. T.Y. Hilton, Coby Fleener at tight-end, and Da&rsquo;rick Rodgers are capable receivers, but the trio are still relative newcomers to playoff football. Claiming a playoff win outside Indy with Luck under centre is this team&rsquo;s next task, and one which may be beyond them in the 2013 season. Only twice, in 2009 and 2010, have the Patriots exited the playoffs in their first game with Brady at the helm. After the heroics of last week, Indy cannot be written off, and to bet against them could be to tempt fate, but it is incredibly hard to look further than a New England victory this weekend.\r\n\r\n<b>San Diego v Denver</b>\r\n\r\nSan Diego&rsquo;s reward for overcoming Cincinnati is an away tie to divisional rivals the Denver Broncos. Denver are AFC Superbowl favourites and only lost three times during the regular season. Worryingly for Denver their home loss was at the hands of this Sunday&rsquo;s opponents. Encouragingly for the Chargers, Peyton Manning has gone 0-2 in his career against them in the post-season.\r\n\r\nManning has been plagued, in an otherwise stellar career, about his less than impressive playoff record in the NFL. Last year the Broncos were dumped out at home by eventual champions Baltimore. They have not made any significant changes since then, bar switching up their running game. However the strength and depth of the team coupled with their often incredible regular season play should see the Broncos past the Chargers.\r\n\r\n<b>San Francisco v Carolina</b>\r\n\r\nThe final divisional matchup sees San Francisco racking up the air miles for the second successive weekend as they head across the country to Carolina, where they meet the Panthers. This tie is intriguing as it will pit two third year quarterbacks with similar styles against each other. Colin Kaepernick and Cam Newton both have the ability to win a game with their feet and their arm. Since Kaepernick became a starter in 2012, he has amassed 1124 rushing yards, while in the same period Newton has collected 972, with similar rushing TD stats for both players.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"541\"]<img class=\"irc_mut\" id=\"irc_mi\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/25/55/63/5692665/3/628x471.jpg\" width=\"541\" height=\"421\" /> Dynamic QB, Colin Kaepernick (7), is one to watch against Carolina.[/caption]\r\n\r\nIf last season was Kaepernick&rsquo;s breakout year, then this season is most certainly the year of Cam. He has always been a talented QB, and his skill was recognised and appreciated from the start of his NFL career, but this season has seen a different side of Newton. A more cerebral player has emerged, and it is paying dividends. A photo of Newton sulking with his now customary towel over his head after a particularly hard to swallow defeat was the standout image of him from last season. This season he has played smarter, said the right things, and led like a potential champion.\r\n\r\nSince week two, the Panthers have gone 12-2, and have reached the playoffs for the first time since 2008. This will be Newton&rsquo;s first playoff game. The fact that it is a home tie can only help. However Kaepernick and his team have the experience of making the Superbowl last year.\r\n\r\nThe Panthers have a tight defence, allowing the second fewest points in the League. They are not the greatest attacking team, languishing in eighteenth overall for points scored. It is evident that the team relies heavily on Newton, and if he is targeted effectively by a mean 49er&rsquo;s defence, the Panthers could be heading for the off-season sooner than desired.\r\n\r\nThe 49ers look to have the edge going into this clash. San Francisco may shade it and head into the Championship game. Either way, expect a lot from the two young QB&rsquo;s on display.\r\n\r\nThe Conference finalists who will emerge from this weekend&rsquo;s round of games will have expended immense energy and emotion to get that stage. No matter who progresses, the teams that eventually advance will have done so entirely on merit as they are no easy fixtures when the playoffs come to town. This weekend will be another epic one for the NFL, where more heroes will rise, while leaving many dejected in defeat, pondering what could have been for another season.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/peyton-manning-steelers.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22971", "Heading": "NFL Divisional Round Preview"}
