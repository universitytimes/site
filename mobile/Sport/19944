{"Body": "&lsquo;&rsquo;18,000 revolutions, 3000 calories burnt, 1200 meters climbed, 100 kilometres travelled, speeds of up to 80km/h, heart pumping at 200 BPM, the wind in your face and the mountains at your back; all just using your legs, lungs and heart - a typical day in the life of a Dublin University cycling club member.&rsquo;&rsquo;\r\n\r\nThis remark from Dermot Cooney, a veteran DUCC member, encapsulates the essence of this demanding sport and why so many people are turning to the bike in an attempt to become fitter and to experience that adrenaline rush that the body craves.\r\n\r\nThere really is something for everyone in DUCC, it has developed its philosophy as one of inclusion and development, regardless of starting point. Its mandate is to help everyone, so to that end \u00a0coaching is provided for those who wish to race, and advice offered from experienced club members to those who just want to know a little bit more and get fitter.\r\n\r\nThere are four elements to the club, each of which the club has proven itself to be a winner in, be it competitive or more leisurely.\r\n\r\nThe first element is, of course, road leisure cycling. Here training sessions are relaxed, conversations flow and the distances are long but the pace easy. Don&rsquo;t worry about how far you can cycle just yet, you&rsquo;ll get there!\r\n\r\nRoad racing is a second, more competitive facet of the club. Separate training sessions are held for those looking to compete. They will take part in lactate threshold training, intervals, VO2 maximal efforts and more.\u00a0 There is very little that can match the experience of riding in a peloton with over 100 riders at average speeds of over 40km/h. Everyone should try at least once.\r\n\r\nMountain biking is an practice of the club which is definitely for the real thrill seekers. Careening down hills at breakneck speeds avoiding obstacles like protruding rocks, trees, ditches and other potentially dangerous objects is the name of the game here.\r\n\r\nFinally we have track cycling. Think Chris Hoy, think maximal efforts, think speed. If one can liken road cycling to filling up a bath to the brim and letting the water out slowly by unplugging the stopper, the track is akin to taking a chainsaw to that same bath and hacking the bottom of it off, to see all of the water comes out in one great torrent.\r\n\r\nWithin each of these disciplines the club have enjoyed great success. Andrew Stanley, current DUCC Road Captain, progressed from being an entry level Category 4 racer last season to an elite Category 1 rider competing and winning at the highest level domestically. Since then he has raced semi-professionally in Asia while on Erasmus, notably reaching the podium at the Tour of Hong Kong. He has also represented Cycling Leinster and has become one of the brightest prospects in terms of emerging young riders in the country. An ambitous young man who has eyes set on the World University Cycling Championships next June.\r\n\r\nAltogether on the road we have over ten active riders racing competitively. Our distinctive jersey, complete with Trinity colours, is now well recognised and respected within the peleton. On the track scene Eoin Healy has had an excellent season this year in the DUCC colours, taking second place in the national league and going on to take the national title in the team sprint event, breaking records in the process. There has also had success on the mountainbiking front with two members competing in national events and achieving top fifteen placings in the process.\r\n\r\nDUCC has gone from strength to strength and it will only keep climbing in stature.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Andrew-Stanley-2-DUCC.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19944", "Heading": "Strength to Strength for DUCC"}
