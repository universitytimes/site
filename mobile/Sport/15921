In some respects yes and in some no. \u00a0Confrontational rugby generally works well against the Australians and, as noted by Danny Cipriani, you aren&rsquo;t going to beat the Wallabies by attempting to be more skillful than them. However, the strategy of hammering them into dust is risky, with the likes of Digby Ioane, Israel Folau, and Adam Ashley-Cooper extremely capable in the contact zone and there appears little scope for a Plan B if the Lions fail to intimidate the Wallabies.</p>\n<strong>Selection</strong>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firstly let&rsquo;s look at selection. \u00a0This is always mired in parochialism. \u00a0In Ireland the reaction on Twitter has been aghast at the exclusion of Simon Zebo and Rory Best. \u00a0Zebo would have been an anomaly in the backline, a relatively slight and skillful player amongst behemoths. \u00a0Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll&rsquo;s reputation warrants selection and his defence is second to none, but the same can&rsquo;t be said of Zebo. Were he selected he would be by himself as a strike-running back as opposed to George North and Tommy Bowe who are far more conventional and abrasive. The Lions don&rsquo;t have any intentions of playing in such a silky fashion and thus the game plan wouldn&rsquo;t have suited Zebo. He will be disappointed but setbacks are a part of sport. \u00a0Sean Maitland is a classy footballer and an excellent decision maker as well as being more physically robust than Zebo. His selection is justified. \u00a0As for Rory Best, his throwing and poor Six Nations not only ended his chances but also Donnacha Ryan&rsquo;s, as it contributed to Ireland&rsquo;s poor lineout in that tournament. \u00a0Accusations of bias can be bandied around seeing Dylan Hartley selected, however Graham Rowntree, the English and Lion&rsquo;s forward coach seemed sincere in saying injuries will result in Best being called up. \u00a0Other unlucky Irish selection is Peter O&rsquo;Mahony who was probably left out on grounds of size.</p>\nThe biggest selection controversy is rightfully that of Chris Robshaw. \u00a0Robshaw has his detractors. \u00a0He is not a specialist in any particular field of his position but performs all the basics to a very high level. \u00a0He captained England to four victories in the Six Nations and received two Man of the Match awards, as well as playing a key role in the defeat of the All Blacks in the November series. \u00a0His omission is probably down to Tommy O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s spellbinding performance in the Stoop, which really took the gloss off Robshaw and confirmed to the Lions management that when the going gets tough, Robshaw goes into a shell. \u00a0The Harlequins captain did the same in Cardiff during England&rsquo;s implosion in the Grand Slam decider. \u00a0Danny Care likewise lost out to Conor Murray who, although has his critics, again matches the managements desire for size and physicality. \u00a0His defensive work rate is also without match from a scrumhalf in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nScottish fans will feel as aggrieved over Kelly Brown and Johnny Beattie not being included. \u00a0The selection of Tom Croft and Dan Lydiate is particularly hard to justify. \u00a0Croft hardly played in the Six Nations and spent most of the time hiding on the wing when he was on the pitch. \u00a0Lydiate hasn&rsquo;t played a serious game all year, missed the Six Nations and there has to be a degree of bias in his selection. \u00a0The management have to some extent dismissed sentimentality. \u00a0There is no uncapped bolter on this tour. \u00a0They have selected players who they know and have worked with. \u00a0They will be aware of their limitations and their strengths. In this respect Rob Kearney and Jamie Heaslip have been the most fortunate. \u00a0Neither have had a particularly vintage season but again they were key players in South Africa in 2009. \u00a0Indeed, both played under Rowntree, Gatland and Rob Howley on that tour. \u00a0Those coaches know how good they are. \u00a0It&rsquo;s hard to imagine would England have had so many forwards were Rowntree and Andy Farrell not present at the selection meeting. \u00a0Mako Vunipola is a decent ball carrier but not a renowned scrummager which seems to contradict the intentions of blasting the Aussie set piece off the park. \u00a0Geoff Parling is a solid scrummager in the engine room, and has a very high work rate. \u00a0One senses that Joe Launchbury and Donnacha Ryan missed out for being perceived as more mobile players, not exactly what the Lions desire down under. \u00a0The selection of Tom Youngs is for all intents and purposes verging on lunacy. \u00a0Rowntree clearly likes Youngs and is willing to fight his corner. \u00a0However, the lad used to play centre for Leicester Tiger&rsquo;s &lsquo;A&rsquo; side and now is being picked for the Lions. \u00a0He can&rsquo;t throw the ball straight beyond four in the lineout. \u00a0The scrutiny upon him will be heavy in light of Best&rsquo;s admission.\n\nIreland with its contingent of nine players can count itself lucky. \u00a0If it is critical to say Lydiate is been taken on faith then so is Tommy Bowe who has also been injured for a portion of this year. \u00a0Again like Kearney and Heaslip the management know what to expect from the Ulster winger. \u00a0Wales have fifteen selected players and this seems to indicate that Gatland counts the Six Nations as a greater indicator of form and potential than European club rugby. \u00a0The argument over whether Heineken Cup rugby is a higher level than Six Nations rugby or the other way round is a complex and difficult one. \u00a0The Welsh provinces have been pretty appalling with no contribution to the knockout stages of the Heineken Cup again, but they still find the majority of selected Lions. \u00a0Warburton has looked anonymous for Cardiff this year most notably in the RDS when Leinster put fifty-nine points on them. \u00a0The only decent Welsh province, the Ospreys who are current Rabo 12 Champions, have three selections. \u00a0Gatland knows that the Welsh players raise their game for big occassions and as such, while selecting so many is a leap of faith it is not exactly blind given how good some of these players are.\n\n<strong>Captaincy</strong>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sam Warburton has so far in the press conference being listed as a &lsquo;starter&rsquo; by Warren Gatland a very uncharacteristic comment from Gatland. \u00a0The leadership and experience of Paul O&rsquo;Connell and Brian O&rsquo;Driscoll will flank Warburton. \u00a0That is a huge benefit for the young Cardiff open side. \u00a0At 24 he has huge potential and when he&rsquo;s played well this year in the Six Nations he&rsquo;s been near enough to the best loose forward in the Northern Hemisphere. \u00a0Justin Tipuric will push him all the way for selection, but that competition is healthy. \u00a0Warburton will also have Europe&rsquo;s premier playmaker in Johnny Sexton at outhalf who is also a leader in his own right. \u00a0Sexton is a banker to start provided he stays fit. \u00a0Andy Farrell has potential but Sexton is in a different atmosphere compared to the Saracen&rsquo;s stand-off. \u00a0Farrell has his detractors in these waters, who see him as arrogant and cocky, but he&rsquo;s a good goal kicker, a brave and technically competent defender and he can cover thirteen. \u00a0The news that Johnny Wilkinson denied the offer of selection on the grounds he wanted younger players to have a shot, as well as his feeling that his body wouldn&rsquo;t be up to it is a measure of the man&rsquo;s class and humility. \u00a0Ian Madigan would have been a bolter and could cover twelve and fifteen. \u00a0He could still expect to be called up but an average performance against Biarritz \u00a0doesn&rsquo;t \u00a0help his cause. \u00a0The Lions have left themselves short at inside centre with only one selected, namely, Jamie Roberts. \u00a0Billy Twelvetrees might have been considered but again the Lions want to bludgeon the Aussies not skate around them with silky skip passes. \u00a0Twelvetrees was probably deemed too raw in any case.</p>\n<strong>Coaches</strong>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Warren Gatland is head coach, with Graham Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Rob Howley his main assistants. \u00a0He also has a backroom team comprising of Robin McBride and Neil Jenkins. \u00a0There is not a single Irish influence in the management. Indeed only Patrick O&rsquo;Reilly aka &lsquo;Rala&rsquo; is the only Irishman not involved in the playing party but as kit man he will hardly be called on to discuss tactics. However, given that Declan Kidney has been sacked and Ireland were second last in the Six Nations, they don&rsquo;t exactly warrant huge influence in matters. \u00a0Not even picking an Irish captain to balance this discrepancy shows how intent Gatland is to win this tour. \u00a0In selection he had no room for sentimentality and he&rsquo;s shown the same in choosing his captain. \u00a0His selection and his intention have been clear from the outset and the team around him has little intention to dispel that notion. \u00a0Farrell who was twice the Super League&rsquo;s Man of Steel takes over from Shaun Edwards as the defence coach and will certainly add grit and menace to the already physically imposing Lions. \u00a0Rowntree was one of the few English coaches to come out of the 2011 Rugby World Cup debacle with an enhanced reputation and thoroughly deserves his place on this tour. \u00a0Howley is also an excellent coach and was responsible for the nascent understanding between Roberts and O&rsquo;Driscoll that caused such damage in 2009 in the high veldt of South Africa. \u00a0He can be relied upon to cause damage with the backs at his disposal. \u00a0Ultimately with their selection and their clear intentions, the danger for the Lions is that if they can&rsquo;t smash the Wallabies down, there is very little else they can do. \u00a0Replacing say Roberts with Manu Tuilagi is exactly a dynamic shift in playing styles. \u00a0The benefit is that their playing style will be easy to implement as the Lions essentially only have \u00a0a month of training before they play the Barbarians in Hong Kong on June 1st.</p>\n<strong>The Australians</strong>\n\nThe Aussies are in disarray. \u00a0The Lions will galvanize them into a response. \u00a0The dismissive arguments of Stephen Jones, Robert Kitson and Chris Hewitt about how weak and poor the Lions are don&rsquo;t add up to the truth. \u00a0Exploring the problems prevalent in Australian Rugby is for a whole other day but they will still have some excellent players. \u00a0Digby Ioane has announced he is moving to a French club and as such the Lions will be his swansong in a gold jersey. \u00a0He remains one of the most prolific strike-runners in Test Rugby and he will be more than up challenge thrown down by Bowe and North. \u00a0Likewise NRL convert Israel Folau will be more than ready for the onslaught the Lions will throw at him. \u00a0He&rsquo;s raw and inexperienced in Union, but he is a phenomenal athlete and was sensational in NRL as a young eighteen year old. \u00a0He is strong in the air and is a good defender. \u00a0New Zealand&rsquo;s favourite Kiwi Quade Cooper will play ten. \u00a0There is no point even trying to predict what he&rsquo;ll be like come the first test in Suncorp Stadium. \u00a0It&rsquo;s likely he&rsquo;ll have walked out from the set-up citing irreconcilable differences with Robbie Deans and will be playing Aussie Rules. \u00a0\u00a0Up front the Lions will hope to run the Aussie scrum into the ground and this is probably why Matt Stevens was selected. \u00a0Injuries to David Pocock have deprived them of their talismanic forward but the Brumbies have re-signed George Smith from Japan who is just as capable. \u00a0Furthermore, youngsters Michael Hooper and Liam Gill have been real finds for Australia and will feature for the Wallabies. \u00a0Will Genia was the best scrumhalf in the world prior to his injury in last year&rsquo;s tri-Nations. \u00a0Kurtley Beale hasn&rsquo;t really hit the heights of two to three seasons ago and as Scott Johnson noted wryly &lsquo;he used to be able to beat a defender in a phone box&hellip;.now he can&rsquo;t even get in the phonebox.&rsquo; \u00a0The Deans era has not been a happy one for the Wallabies yet the confidence which the media have bestowed upon the Lions will upset the uber-competitive Australians and cause a reaction. \u00a0Whether that reaction is to go quietly or go out with a bang remains to be seen. \u00a0The Tests will be competitive and exciting. \u00a0The midweek games will be a whole other matter. \u00a0While the Brumbies top the Super 15 table and the Reds are current champions they are the wheat from the chaff. \u00a0The Western Force and the NSW Waratahs are awfully poor. Melbourne are liable to concede over seventy points if they are deprived of their international contingent.", "Imageurl": "15925", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15921", "Heading": "Pride of Lions Head Down Under "}
