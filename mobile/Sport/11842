It inhabits a bewildering and bewitching parallel universe of excitement, controversy, immaturity, outlandishness and heartbreak. The competition never fails to snaffle attention and capture and toy with the imagination. One thing it rarely is, however, is coherent. Often, the competition brings to life the adage to &ldquo;expect the unexpected&rdquo;. The dramatic end to last season is testament to that, as the title swung from one side of Manchester to the other before being sealed by a swipe of Sergio Aguero&rsquo;s right foot. A Manchester City title win was expected, and it was the ending that we received, but only after an incoherent and extraordinary storyline. Premier League 2012/13 promises many of the same thrills.\n\nThe way City sealed the title triggered a feeling that Roberto Mancini&rsquo;s billionaires were ready to dominate English football. To shake off the perceived &lsquo;City curse&rsquo;, and to deny Manchester United the title so dramatically, seemed to exorcise all of the demons residing on the blue moon. Now with the glitter of silverware to complement the glitter of silver coins, City were expected to assume an all conquering aura and cement themselves at the summit of English football. Roberto Mancini spoke days after winning the title of the importance of spending more money, further strengthening his squad. At the time of writing, City had signed just one player; Jack Rodwell from Everton. While talented, it is a curious signing; Rodwell is a young player who has yet to fully develop, and City already have a midfield swollen with superstars. One feels like he was signed in the hope that more will follow, and to avoid him signing for United. Mancini has been very public in his criticism for Brian Marwood, who he perceives is to blame for City&rsquo;s lethargic transfer dealings thus far. Robin Van Persie&rsquo;s transfer to Old Trafford will further deteriorate their relationship/ Mancini feels he has solid ground to stand on if he is to criticise his bosses, but the memories of last season will fade quickly if he can&rsquo;t match their domestic achievement and improve performances in Europe. On the field, there are weaknesses, particularly at centre-back where there is a lack of cover. Vincent Kompany is crucial to City&rsquo;s success, while Joleon Lescott was outstanding last season. An injury to either of them could be fatal to City, as Stevan Savic looks out of his depth and Kolo Toure is unwanted. Hence the interest in Liverpool&rsquo;s Daniel Agger.\n\nManchester United have also had a difficult close season, where Alex Ferguson has had to concern himself more with dollars and flotations than with defenders and forwards. The circus surrounding the Glazers has been the most unwelcome of distractions as United plot their title quest. It is through the prism of the Glazer mismanagement that United fans can conjure the only justifiable criticism of Alex Ferguson. His failure to do what Rafa Benitez did at Liverpool, and speak out against his American owners, could eventually detract from his legacy. On the field Ferguson has made a canny signing in Shinji Kagawa, and a potentially title-winning one in Robin Van Persie. If United can keep him fit, they could be on their way to a record 20<sup>th</sup> title.\n\nWhereas United and City have been relatively frugal, Chelsea have spent like there it is 2004 all over again. Abramovich has been inspired to open his chequebook, with a multi million pound splurge on Eden Hazard, Marco Marin and Oscar. Hazard is a superb signing, and in time Oscar will prove to be too. Chelsea have a potentially lethal forward line, with Juan Mata, Hazard and Oscar giving Fernando Torres plenty of ammunition to rediscover his form. Roberto Di Matteo will be concerned over a creaky defence that surrendered three goals in twelve minutes in the Community Shield, although this was mitigated by Branislav Ivanovic&rsquo;s red card. Despite winning the FA Cup and Community Shield, Di Matteo was only awarded a two year contract after Pep Guardiola decided to recharge his batteries for a year. If Di Matteo doesn&rsquo;t find success soon, he could be yet another to fall victim to Abramovich&rsquo;s trigger-happy tendencies.\n\nIt is a sense of d\u00e9j\u0155 vu for Arsenal. Henry, Fabregas, Nasri, and now Van Persie. Wenger will soon run out of stars who involve themselves in transfer sagas. While keeping Van Persie seemed imperative in June, Wenger&rsquo;s unusually active transfer dealings may soften the blow of the Dutchman&rsquo;s departure. Olivier Giroud and Lucas Podolski should add a measure of firepower if not consistency, while Santi Cazorla resembles the signing of the summer. Wenger is still adamant he wants Van Persie to stay, despite being booed by his own supporters in a friendly game in Germany last week. Despite Van Persie&rsquo;s departure, Arsenal still look capable of staying in the top 4.\n\nAnother season, another new era for Liverpool. For a fourth season in a row, the club have a fourth different manager. Can Brendan Rodgers succeed where Hodgson, Dalglish and to a lesser extent Benitez failed? Kenny Dalglish was fired for a woeful league season, finishing eighth was deemed unacceptable for John Henry. Rodgers has been given the difficult task of getting Liverpool back to the Champions League, whilst reducing the wage bill at the same time. Joe Allen and Fabio Borini look solid signings, while the extension of Luis Suarez&rsquo; contract is a huge boost. Rodgers has showed an impressive knowledge of what it takes to be successful at Liverpool thus far, but putting it into practice is a far different story. It is likely to take time for his vision of total football to return to Anfield.\n\nThe return of the assured arrogance of Andre Villas Boas to the Premier League with Tottenham will be fascinating. A failure at Chelsea has damaged his reputation but has not destroyed it, but the Tottenham job is the biggest in his career thus far. He has faced a number of problems already, the biggest one being the Luka Modric quandary. With Madrid yet to meet Spurs&rsquo; valuation, Villas Boas has been unable to bring in his own play maker, Joao Moutinho. There are further problems up front, with Jermaine Defoe the only senior striker at the club at the time of writing. AVB is a fine coach, but like Rodgers, it could take time before Tottenham are ready to flourish under his management.\n\nNewcastle will be hard pressed to better their wonderful form last season, but crucially have kept the squad together. Alan Pardew may not have added much to the squad but in Cabaye, Tiote, and Cisse they have world-class talent, and together with an excellent team spirit, should be enough to guarantee a top seven finish.\n\nEverton have been more active than usual in the transfer market, with the arrival of Stevens Pienaar and Davis. David Moyes said that the last time they had been this active so early in the market they ended up in the Champions League. That seemed an impossible task this year, particularly after losing Rodwell to City. With Moyes at the helm however, and with Jelavic up front, this could finally be the season that Everton give Moyes the cup he deserves.\n\nSunderland ended last season rather well under Martin O&rsquo; Neill, and the Wearsiders will hope to push for a European place. His former side Aston Villa will struggle to finish that high, but look set for a much more enjoyable season under Paul Lambert. Lambert&rsquo;s appointment will be a welcome relief to the fans that endured a wretched season under Alec McLeish. Mid table mediocrity beckons for Villa, Fulham and Stoke.\n\nNorwich and Swansea could both struggle after losing the managers that took them to the top division, but should have enough to avoid the drop. Mark Hughes has added intelligently to his squad at QPR, particularly with the arrival of Park and Fabio from Old Trafford. Hughes will be targeting a far more comfortable season this time around.\n\nOf the promoted teams, Southampton look like they may struggle the most, with Jay Rodriguez the biggest of many modest arrivals. Reading will be difficult to beat, however may struggle to win enough games to beat the drop. The arrival of Pavel Pogbrebnyak should help remedy this however. As for West Ham, they look well placed to comfortably avoid relegation.\n\nWigan look set to lose another top performer, Victor Moses, and it remains to be seen how many more miracles Roberto Martinez has left in him. Steve Clarke has had great success as an assistant manager, particularly at Chelsea. The spotlight will be on him as the main man at West Brom, and while he will be hard-pressed to emulate the feats of Roy Hodgson, and while the loan signing of Romelu Lukaku should help, they could struggle.\n\nThe 2012/13 script is about to be written. It will be exciting, jovial and heartbreaking. It will stir the imagination. Just don&rsquo;t expect it to make much sense.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Predictions</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChampions: \u00a0Manchester United\n\nChampions League: Manchester City\n\nChelsea\n\nArsenal\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRelegated: Wigan\n\nWest Brom\n\nSouthampton\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFA Cup: Manchester United\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCapital One Cup: Everton\n\n&nbsp;\n<p lang=\"en-IE\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-IE\"></p>", "Imageurl": "11844", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "11842", "Heading": "Premiership 2012/2013: Don't Expect the Script to Make Much Sense"}
