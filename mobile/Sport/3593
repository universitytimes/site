First of Mark Stekelenberg and Manuel Neueur, then fleetingly of Gianluigi Buffon, and ultimately of David de Gea. Increasingly frustrated and gazzumped \u00a0of late, Sir Alex was not to be beaten once he had set his mind on young de Gea.\n\nWearing a number one at Old Trafford carries the added significance of the shadows of Peter Schmeichel and van der Sar, as well as the list of those many goalkeepers whose careers were often the consequence of failure to replace the former.\n\nSince de Gea's signing, the rhetoric has been typically bullish. Ferguson was acutely aware that his new goalkeeper spoke no English, had never left Madrid but for football games, and had conceded more goals from outside the area than any other La Liga goalkeeper last year. 'He'll come good - very good' was the unwavering red-nosed endorsement.\n\nThe 20-year old's first two games in a United shirt are bound to shake that optimism, albeit privately and not by much. The knife-and-razor-happy British media have shown their humanitarian side; almost all major journalists remain equally confident that de Gea will 'come good'.\n\nI'm confident too, sort of. But all of a sudden, this kid (a year older than this author) has a massive challenge on his hands. Drawing Arsenal, Liverpool, and Tottenham inside the first four games following a clash with Manchester City is enough to test any nervous goalkeeper with big shoes to fill; having to do so without the assurance of Rio Ferdinand and Nemaja Vidic in front of him is even worse.\n\nThe combination of these two situations and De Gea's initial struggles is the fulfilment of the worst-case scenario prophecy, but one for which Sir Alex would always have to have prepared in making the signing. De Gea now has to use a voice he hasn't found in a language he doesn't know to command a back-line whose most senior member is 23-year old Jonny Evans.\n\nJudging on last week's performance at West Brom, this is a situation with which even the unflappable Fergie will have problems. There was one painful moment in which 21-year old Fabio Da Silva shaped to play a back-pass, hesitated on sight of De Gea, and hurriedly fashioned an awkward clearance. Hardly inspiring viewing, and even Matthew Dawson has no worries about error-prone Heurelho Gomes.\n\nManchester United is a club of evolution not revolution, meaning that players, whether \u00a0youth prospects or big-money signings, are generally afforded a settling-in period before ostentatious brilliance is demanded. Nani and Anderson had so-so first seasons, as did Patrice Evra, and look at them now. Except Anderson, don't look at him.\n\nWith De Gea, things are different; the goalkeeper is the keystone of a successful side, and the pressure to emulate his successor is immense. Ferguson can protect him from journalists, but he can't afford to protect him from the limelight by keeping him out of the side.\n\nRisking the blasphemy fine imposed in this country, I have to question Sir Alex Ferguson's wisdom on this one just a little bit. He is looking for a long-term successor to van der Sar, but what he has found is a kid. This is a summer in which both Neueur and Stekelenberg were available for transfer, and both have 10-15 years left of playing in them with bags of experience to boot.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that the former Athletico Madrid stopper gets through the next month unscathed, he will carry the tag of 'dodgy keeper' for some years to come. Opposition strikers will be galvanised by that extra incentive to have a pop at goal, and the younger defenders in the squad will act reflectively where van der Sar gave them the confidence to act reflexively.\n\nWhile only 20 years of age, it may well be that the next few games will already define de Gea's career in a visibly ill-fitting Manchester United jersey. He has the talent to play for United for the next 20 years and let's hope he displays that ability, sooner rather than later. Otherwise, he may join The Red Devils in a difficult few years and confirm the doom-and-gloom of those who propound Peter Schmeichel's legacy.\n\nI hate those guys.", "Imageurl": "3594", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "3593", "Heading": "David de Gea and the ghost of keepers past"}
