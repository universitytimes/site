As always with the first event of the year, Trinity had to cope with a limited amount of practice time before competing with the event coming just three weeks after the start of teaching term. Nevertheless, the new season is now\u00a0under way\u00a0with our first piece of silverware secured by TCD 6 winning the Silver Fleet.\n\nTCD 1 &amp; 2 had a tough draw in the competitive 'Gold A' fleet, competing against teams from UCC, NUIG, DCU, UL, and a mixed team of recent graduates. They finished up with a disappointing 5th and 6th in this fleet, but Captain Jake Mealy hopes the results for our top teams will improve with more training lined up from this week onwards.\n\nTCD 3 &amp; 4 had some good results in Saturday's Round Robin in the Silver Fleet, but both were unfortunate to be beaten in the Quarter Finals of this fleet on Sunday. TCD 5 competing with many sailors enjoying their\u00a0d\u00e9but\u00a0outing in the IUSA fleet competed well in the Bronze Fleet, however the result of the weekend must go to TCD 6 who came through the Bronze Fleet undefeated on Saturday's session and whose momentum carried them to do the same on Sunday and win the Silver Fleet outright.\n\nThe recent phenomenon of Trinity's excellent strength in depth continues to show in the consistently strong finishes achieved by our middle teams, however the top teams will need to keep training hard to cope with the intense competition of the IUSA Gold Fleet to achieve our goal of an event win this year.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_13403\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"448\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2012/11/19/dusc-have-solid-opening-to-the-201213-season/wexford-harbour-640x362/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-13403\"><img class=\" wp-image-13403 \" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Wexford-Harbour-640x3623.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"253\" /></a> Wexford Harbour[/caption]", "Imageurl": "13402", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/TCD6-800x454-640x3633", "ID": "13401", "Heading": "DUSC have Solid Opening to the 2012/13 Season"}
