The scene in Stuttgart's Neckarstadion has since been immortalised by Christy Moore who sings: \"the ball fell to Ray Houghton and he stuck it in the net.\"\n\nThe team that started\u00a0alongside Scottish-born Houghton that day contained\u00a0just three players born in Ireland, Packie Bonner, Steve Stauton and Kevin Moran.\u00a0The remaining seven players, including the likes of\u00a0Mick McCarthy, Chris Hughton and John Aldridge,\u00a0were\u00a0playing against their\u00a0country of birth and seeing to its downfall.\n\nEarlier this week, Joey Barton (in bizarrely confrontational form!) launched a twitter\u00a0attack on Bury-born\u00a0former Ireland player and occasional captain Matt Holland. Barton said: \"If ur English, u play for England. If ur English and sh*t, u pretend ur Irish grand parentage matters to u and play for Ireland.\"\n\nSince Shay Brennan, born to Irish parents in England, first lined out in the\u00a0green of Ireland, Irish managers\u00a0have used the parentage rule and later \"the granny rule\" to great effect. A Scotsman gave us our first goal at a major championship and later a world cup winner against Italy, while we were led to our first two World Cups by English-born captains. Today's team also\u00a0has several \"plastic paddies\".\n\nOverlooking the needless aggression in his words, Barton did raise an interesting issue: does the Irish heritage of these players matter to them? Should we care if it doesn't? Holland replied claiming that he wore the Irish shirt with pride and I have no doubt that this is true.\n\nIt was evident from the dedication shown by the likes of\u00a0Holland and Kevin Kilbane (going even as far as learning the words to \u00c1mhr\u00e1n na bhFiann) that Ireland mattered hugely\u00a0to them. But will 2004's one-cap-wonder Jon Macken look back on their time as an Irishman with a tear in their eye?\n\nHolland himself gave me one of my favourite Ireland memories, being too young to remember the days of Lawrenson, Aldridge and Townsend. I was nine years old and getting my first (and to this point only) taste of Ireland playing at an international tournament. I'll never forget Holland's second half equaliser against Cameroon or the ensuing scenes of celebration. A poster on my bedroom wall has the scene etched in my mind and this is not something I would dream of trading.\n\nIn my books, the likes of Holland\u00a0are\u00a0as Irish as he they\u00a0say they\u00a0are, who am I and who is Joey Barton to question this?\n\nThis question of \"Irishness\" has reared its head a number of times in the years since the\u00a0Good Friday Agreement, with a number of players born in the north declaring for Ireland.\n\nCan you blame a player for trying to bring his career to a new level by using his heritage? Can you blame a country's fans for wanting the best possible players available? Is it wrong that we benefit from various waves of emigration from the island?\n\nBarton also pointed out that for every English-born Irish player, the will be an Irish-born\u00a0one not getting a look in. This issue arose when now second choice goalkeeper Keiran Westwood claimed that he was not Irish \"as such\" but\u00a0rather \"a good Catholic\u00a0boy\" to the fury of Bohemians' in-form goalkeeper Brian Murphy, now of Ipswich.\n\nOf course, I don't believe that as situation should ever arise whereby\u00a0countries\u00a0have free reign\u00a0to pick and choose what players they would like to \"sign\". A line must be drawn somewhere and for that reason,\u00a0we can assume\u00a0that a \"great granny rule\" will never emerge.\n\nBarton has given food for thought. However,\u00a0while I would prefer to have more Irish-born players on the team (if only as a testament to our youth development), the fact is, if eligible by FIFA rules to play, I'll never begrudge an English-born player a place on the Irish team.", "Imageurl": "7722", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "7721", "Heading": "Granny's the word"}
