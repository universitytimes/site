While Ireland lost that day, their scrum performed admirably and against Fiji Bent again was on the replacements bench coming on at fifty-three minutes.\u00a0 To call the game against Fiji a contest would be unfair, but Bent got more time on the pitch slowly integrating into the Irish team.\u00a0 Then the frightful Argentineans came to the Aviva.\u00a0 Renowned for their <em>bajada </em>style of scrummaging, Bent was again a replacement and acquitted himself well against Leicester&rsquo;s Marcos Ayerza.\u00a0 He has clearly shown himself to be a capable and effective scrummager who has fitted seamlessly into the Irish team set-up.\u00a0 The criticisms have evaporated in light of his capabilities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo how has he ended up in DUFC?\u00a0 Every professional player contracted in the four provinces is assigned to a domestic club.\u00a0 Every club applies for access to players not already assigned a club, and in this respect DUFC with the help of ex-IRFU President Peter Boyle&rsquo;s, Bent was registered for Trinity.\u00a0 Despite the soundings of supporting grassroots at all levels, players are generally encouraged to sign for a Division 1A or Division 1B club.\u00a0 With the exception of Munster, most of the provinces use their local clubs sparingly.\u00a0 On occasion they may pluck a player from a club team into the sides &lsquo;A&rsquo; team or to shore up in an injury crisis.\u00a0 By and large, though, the clubs have little contact with the players.\u00a0 Paul O&rsquo;Connell played for Young Munster when he returned from a lengthy injury lay-off but generally the coaches and medical staff prefer to ease in injured players through &lsquo;A&rsquo; games or in league fixtures against weak opposition.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is likely Bent will never play for DUFC in his time in Ireland.\u00a0 The only way it may happen, is if he suffers an injury and on the road to full fitness is told to grab some game time in the Ulster Bank League.\u00a0 Again, Leinster would rather have closer supervision of their asset and play him in the &lsquo;A&rsquo; games.\u00a0 The expansion of the British &amp; Irish cup has resulted in an increased number of opportunities for peripheral and young players in the provinces to get regular game time. All the same, the players are encouraged to help out in the clubs they are assigned to.\u00a0 It increases their media profile, helps the clubs image and develops links between the clubs and the provinces.\u00a0 It is the clubs where most players started their rugby careers, even before school and underage representative rugby.\u00a0 The IRFU, wary of this, have been careful not to completely cast the clubs into the wilderness.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBent could be involved in DUFC in this way.\u00a0 A player of his expertise and skill would be a vital asset to the coaches.\u00a0 Tony Smeeth could, and will, invite Bent down to trainings on Tuesday and Thursday nights, where the prop can use what little spare time a professional athlete has to help out and give clinics on scrummaging and forward play.\u00a0 Smeeth, and forwards coach Hugh McGuire, are canny operators.\u00a0 Les Kiss regularly gives defensive clinics in College Park and McGuire famously asked ex-All Black hooker Anton Oliver to give his front row a session after DUFC beat Oxford some years back.\u00a0 All things considered, those of you hoping to see him playing in the white of DUFC may have to wait a long time.", "Imageurl": "13706", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13705", "Heading": "Michael Bent Signs for Trinity Rugby"}
