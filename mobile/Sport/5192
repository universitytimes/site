They beat Iran 2-1 on aggregate in 2002 to qualify for the World Cup, but are yet to qualify for a major international tournament since.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "5193", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "5192", "Heading": "Republic draw Estonia in play-off"}
