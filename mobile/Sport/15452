Synge Lecture Theatre, and nights out in Workman's and The Grand Social.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">On Saturday, universities sent their teams in shifts out to Gravity Climbing Centre in Inchicore for the bouldering segment of the competition. Each climber was set fifteen problems to complete (with different problems for male, female, advanced and beginner categories), and at the end of the day, John Howard (TCD), Casey Harn (NUIG), Edward Cox (UCD), and Grainne Aylward (DCU) took the lead in their respective categories.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Sunday saw the competitors tramping off to the Awesome Walls Climbing Centre in Finglas for the second half of the competition- routes. John Howard, Casey Harn, and Edward Cox all held the top place in their categories, and Hannah Hayes (UCC) emerged victorious in the beginner female category.</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Individually, the Trinity team were extremely strong, holding top three positions in 3 of the 4 categories:</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">Male Beginner: Philip McDonald (3</span><sup style=\"line-height: 19px;\">rd</sup><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">)</span>\n\nFemale Advanced: Katie Coldrick (2<sup>nd</sup>)\n\nMale Advanced: John Howard (1<sup>st</sup>), Andrew McKay and David Fitzgerald (3<sup>rd</sup>=)\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">However unfortunately, the Trinity team were unable to defend the trophy in the overall team category, coming third after strong competition, particularly in the Female Beginner category, from UCD (1</span><sup style=\"line-height: 19px;\">st</sup><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">) and NUIG (2</span><sup style=\"line-height: 19px;\">nd</sup><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">).</span>\n<span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;\">After the climbing, there was a raffle in aid of Dublin-Wicklow Mountain Rescue.</span>\n\nCongratulations to the DUCC committee, headed by Alice Duggan ('14), who, thanks to their tireless efforts, made this possible.
