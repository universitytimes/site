In light of 14 year old Tianlang Guan's harsh penalty on Friday, the rules of golf came to the fore again as the four-time Masters winner was cut some slack\u00a0over a rules infringement on the 15<sup>th</sup>\u00a0hole of Friday&rsquo;s round where Tiger&rsquo;s drop out from the hazard was adjudged to be illegal.\n<div>The build-up to round three was marred in controversy.\u00a0The Rules Committee reviewed a video of the drop on the 15<sup>th</sup>\u00a0hole and had decided that he had complied with the rules when he had signed his card. What had gotten the world number one into trouble was his subsequent television interview where he stated that he played further from the point where he played his shot.\u00a0\"I went down to the drop area, that wasn't going to be a good spot [&hellip;] it was a little bit wet. So it was muddy and not a good spot to drop.\u00a0So I went back to where I played it from, but I went two-yards further back and I took, tried to take two-yards off the shot of what I felt I hit.\"\u00a0This incited a further review of the incident where it was determined that Tiger had violated Rule 26 and was assessed a two-stroke penalty.</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n\nDisqualification for an incorrect scorecard?\u00a0This is where Rule 33-7 came into play, a rule change from 2011. When considering whether Woods should be disqualified or not, it states that players who learn of a violation after they sign their cards can be penalised without being disqualified. Rule 33-7 is not just a &lsquo;new Tiger rule&rsquo;; it just happens to be that the most recognisable face in the game was the first high profile implementation of it.\u00a0If the rule committee determined that no infraction had been made, therefore telling Tiger he could sign his card with no violation of the rules, under this logic a disqualification would be incorrect. The USGA and R&amp;A governing bodies agreed with the decision.\n\n</div>\nThe likes of sportswriter Dan Jenkins, analyst Nick Faldo and fellow player David Duval indicated their feelings that Woods should withdraw to maintain the integrity of the game. While this would have been a conciliatory gesture that may have gained him a few extra fans, it is wrong to have expected him to withdraw from the tournament; very few golfers would have given up the chance of winning golf's Holy Grail for a penalty not judged to be worthy of disqualification by those most knowledgeable of the rules of golf. Tiger was in essence penalised four shots on the 15<sup>th</sup>\u00a0of Friday&rsquo;s round for what was an almost perfect approach. Woods did not get off scot-free, the infringement still put a dent in his aspirations to be in Butler&rsquo;s Cabin on Sunday evening.\u00a0With an official decision made, the 14-time major champion played on without any signs of being rattled by the incident, he almost holed his second shot on the first hole. Woods posted a two under par 70 today to leave himself in with a chance of a contentious major victory number fifteen on Sunday evening. Nevertheless, a cloud hangs over Tiger&lsquo;s Masters performance over the weekend that just simply will not go away easily. Contrary to the new Nike caption, winning here won&rsquo;t take care of everything.\n\nElsewhere, it was the most difficult day yet as the greens firmed to leave only the most precise shots unpunished. Fed-Ex Cup Champion Brandt Snedeker and former Masters Champion Angel Cabrera emerged from the grind the most favourably. Both shot three under par 69s to hold a one stroke lead over Adam Scott, who also carded a 69. Australia&rsquo;s Jason Day led for most of the day and looked assured under the major spotlight but stumbled on the closing two holes to fall two back of the leaders and share a tie for fourth with fellow Aussie Marc Leishman. He will go out in the third to last group tomorrow with the dark horse Matt Kuchar who crept up nicely after recording a three under par 69. Tim Clark made the biggest charge among the early players shooting a 67 that left him tied with Woods at three under.\u00a0Unfortunately for the Masters patrons, veteran Fred Couples bid for another Green Jacket faded in his back nine, disappointingly slumping to even par for the tournament. Ulsterman Rory McIlroy was another to fall foul of the harsher, firmer conditions, he posted two sevens towards a humiliating 79. \u00a0Snedeker would seem like the man to beat tomorrow. Prior to his rib injury which left him out of action for six weeks, the American had four top 3s in his first five events of the PGA Tour season. Adam Scott would prove to be a popular winner, a shot at redemption after his tragic meltdown at the Open Championship less than a year ago. Yet the most dubious Masters win of them all cannot be ruled out tomorrow after a\u00a0Saturday that will be remembered for Tiger Woods' penalty\n\n</div>", "Imageurl": "15643", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "15642", "Heading": "Moving Day at the Masters"}
