{"Body": "<strong>Sarah Ledden |\u00a0</strong>Staff Writer\r\n\r\nOn the back of an impressive 15-0 victory over Drogheda IFE, Dublin University Ladies AFC had high hopes going into their final group game against DIT. When last DULAFC played on College Park they opened their season with a 3-1 win over IT Blanchardstown. Maintaining their winning form and driven by the momentum of their previous wins, Trinity beat DIT by a respectable scoreline of 4-1. After a disappointing season last year, the increase of numbers signing up to the team and the influx of fresh feet sculpted new boundaries for the club.\r\n\r\nThe tension of expectation and the knowledge that a positive result would lead to succession in the league, perhaps led to a slow start from the Trinity ladies, as both sets of teams struggled to adjust to the wet pitch conditions and adapt to their competition. A long-range shot from DIT's Laura Chambers in the early stages of the game, which struck the top of the crossbar, was the catalyst needed to ignite a spark in the match that would carry through to the end.\r\n\r\nMidfield battles have always been considered crucial with responsibilities to both attack and defend, initiate and conclude offensive moves and prevent opposition advances. DIT and Trinity appeared equally matched in midfield in the first half with no dominance emerging. It was when quick passing was imposed by the home team that the DIT defence was broken down, with Trinity displaying one- and two-touch passing finesse, frequently working the ball into an ideal position to cross or shoot. The passing and movement from Trinity worked in their favour as accurate and well-timed passing attributed to each of their four goals. Trinity were first to convert from their chances with Vanessa Hullon's low cross finding the feet of Alex Millstrom who coolly slotted the ball into the bottom corner, out of the DIT goalkeeper's reach. Millstrom's goal injected a new pace to the Trinity attack with Ciara Harris striking a free-kick minimally over the bar and Amy Hannigan seeing a last minute save prevent the score from doubling.\r\n\r\nDIT were determined to prevent this increase from happening and, went one further, as they succeeded in equalising. A well-timed through ball caught the defence off guard for DIT's Laura Chambers to drop the ball over the head of the Trinity keeper into the net. In most means of life, balance is a harmonious experience, but in a competitive game, only dissonance can follow the melody of an equalizer. Trinity were quick to respond to this setback, with Allison Miller taking the ball down the wing, sweeping it into the box to Marissa Barnes who hit it first time into the back of the net. Vanessa Hullon was denied a goal just before half-time when her strike bounced off the inside of the crossbar onto the goal-line in a dramatic moment that would have reignited the goal-line technology debate. Perhaps a &lsquo;Hawkeye&rsquo; system is overdue in College Park. Despite her missed opportunity, Hullon soon recovered to set-up Ciara Harris, giving Trinity a two goal lead at half-time.\r\n\r\nWith a flow of substitutions in the second half, fatigued feet were not given a chance to slow the pace of the game. Trinity appeared the more threatening side with many convertible chances hitting the framework of the goal or being sent skyward. The DIT defence recovered well from the challenged being forced upon them, but as Trinity began to dominate the crucial midfield area, many of their clearances were returned their way. DIT struggled to push forward, opting more regularly to take long-range chances that were easily dealt with by Fisher. Trinity put the game beyond all doubt when Barnes' head met Harris' corner entry for her second goal of the day and making the final-whistle scoreline 4-1 to Trinity.\r\n\r\nWith three wins from three games, DU Ladies AFC have a very optimistic season ahead of them. With their win against DIT, they finish top of the Dublin North first division group with maximum points and will now progress into the final stages of the league.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/DSC_0904.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21988", "Heading": "Trinity Ladies Top the Table"}
