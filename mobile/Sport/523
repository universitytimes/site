Plenty of squad depth at Villa, maybe another striker could be bought as Carew, Agbonlahor and Heskey are not delivering the goals needed to secure a European spot.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Birmingham City</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Everything. 13 game record breaking winning streak? Check. Lower league signings performing better than some of their international counterparts? Check. Retired players returning from the wilderness and now in the best form of their career? Check. Everything Alex McLeish has touched has turned to gold this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Nothing really.

Surely the only way from here on is down though?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />New investment is available to buy players who would normally be out of reach for a club of Birmingham&rsquo;s size but McLeish is understandably reluctant to upset the harmony in his small squad mid season especially with the performances they are delivering.</span></p>\n<p>Blackburn Rovers</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Typical Sam Allardyce team, not pretty to watch but effective.

The form of Gary Cahill has been a plus point in this World Cup season and has led to him being linked with an outside chance of a squad place for South Africa.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />For a team that finished 13th last season a 19th place berth at this stage of the season is extremely disappointing. The players and fans lack of belief in manager Gary Megson has contributed to the poor start and led to Megson&rsquo;s dismissal.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Sack the manager! Always the solution isn&rsquo;t it? Bolton&rsquo;s squad is strong enough to survive and the hiring of Owen Coyle could lead to a reversal in fortunes at the Reebok Stadium.</span></p>\n<p>Burnley</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Home form.

Championship players playing to a Premiership standard has also contributed to the good start but can they keep it up?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Their away form. One point from a possible thirty three with 34 goals conceded in just 11 games. Stunning that a team can have such different fortunes on what is to put it lightly just a pitch in another stadium. The loss of their inspirational manager Owen Coyle may prove telling when the season is complete.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />With meagre funds available, a raid on the lower divisions looks likely but will the necessary quality to keep the clarets up be available? Doubtful.</span></p>\n<p>Chelsea</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />After two inconsistent seasons which delivered just one FA Cup and one Community shield the appointment of highly successful Carlo Ancelotti appears to be a shrewd one. His players are old but many are enjoying an Indian summer under the manager&rsquo;s influence</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Poor form from Petr Cech is partly responsible for Chelsea not being further ahead. The uncharacteristic concession of late goals at home is something which has cost them a bigger lead in this, the closest title race in years.

Ancelotti is refusing to add to his squad believing that they possess enough quality to compete on all fronts already. Only time will tell if his trust in his players is repaid.</span></p>\n<p>Everton</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />The form of Louis Saha has been instrumental in keeping Everton in the top half this season, 11 of Everton&rsquo;s 30 goals in the top flight have come from the French star and his health is of the utmost importance to their progress.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />A terrible injury crisis robbing &lsquo;The Toffees&rsquo; of players such as Phil Jagielka and Mikel Arteta is the main reason for the inconsistent form which has Everton maybe a few places below where they belong. Just four home wins from eleven tries is below par.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />With little or no money to work with this January it is important for David Moyes to try and keep his key players fit for the run in. Luck with injuries and astute investment in the summer will more than likely see Everton challenging for the European spots next season.</span></p>\n<p>Fulham</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />For a second consecutive season Roy Hodgson has his side competing well above what is expected of them, except this time it is on both domestic and European fronts. Six home wins including the notable scalps of Manchester United and Liverpool is more than impressive.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />One away win in nine attempts is relatively poor for a team of Fulham&rsquo;s ability. After an injury to Clint Dempsey this weekend Bobby Zamora stands alone as the major goal threat, should he have fitness issues The Cottagers could struggle.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Ensure press rumours that Roy Hodgson is destined for a bigger job aren&rsquo;t fulfilled, he has transformed the club from cannon fodder to European contenders in just two years. If the injury to Clint Dempsey is serious a replacement is advisable.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Hull City</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.II</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Four home wins have give Hull hope of staying up. When Jimmy Bullard is fit they look like they can compete with anybody in the league. The signing of Stephen Hunt was a clever one, 5 goals from midfield a good return.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Jimmy Bullard&rsquo;s knee. Again. He is crucial to Hull&rsquo;s chance of safety, and average of 2 goals conceded per game hasn&rsquo;t helped. Four points from 11 away games isn&rsquo;t a great record and needs to be improved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Hull have weaknesses all over the park but it is in the middle where they are lacking most when Bullard is not fit. The old adage appears again though: How do you replace the irreplaceable?</span></p>\n<p>Liverpool</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: III</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />From a purely subjective point of view? Everything! Objectively it is heartening to see the fans standing by their manager and realising despite the media hype that he only picks the team and cannot be held accountable for lack of form and effort from some of his senior professionals. Mr. Gerrard knows what I&rsquo;m talking about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Careless spending by Rafael Benitez has put his side in a perilous position. Spending &pound;20m on a player not available for the first two months of the season is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the eccentric Spaniard&rsquo;s transfer dealings. Liverpool have been in this position before in 2005 when they actually failed to make the top four but success in the European Cup allowed them to receive special dispensation to compete in the competition the following year. An early exit means there is no such get out clause this time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Squad strengthening is the only way forward for Benitez and he has already shown signs of movement with the free transfer deal for Argentinian international Maxi Rodriguez. It is questionable whether funds are available to buy in January and if this is the case with a long term injury to Fernando Torres it will be a long second half of the season for the Merseyside club.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Manchester City</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />The signings of Roberto Mancini as manager and Carlos Tevez. City have been transformed from a mid-table side under Mark Hughes to potential title contenders under Mancio almost overnight it seems. A comprehensive 2-0 loss to Everton this weekend brought their fans back down to Earth but they will be over their blue moon if they can knock local rivals Manchester United out of the League Cup and secure a first trophy since 1976.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />What must be the most expensively assembled defence ever has conceded a disappointing 30 goals in just 21 games and but for the form of Shay Given it could be much worse. An injury to Joleon Lescott appears to have sparked a change in City&rsquo;s fortunes though. An expensive flop for just &pound;24m at the time of print.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />With a limitless source of money City can afford to buy every other club in the Premier League and still have change in the billions. Needless to say any gaps that Mancini feels his side has will be filled by an expensive potentially world class signing.</span></p>\n<p>Manchester United</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Wayne Rooney finally delivering the goals his talent has promised and Ryan Giggs continuing his excellent form from last season have been high points in a stop-start season for the champions. Have encountered many obstacles this season including the worst injury crisis seen in Ferguson&rsquo;s 23 years but the fact they are still contending on almost all fronts is a testament to the squad the old master has built.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />The aforementioned injury crisis. With almost &pound;100m worth of players unavailable for large quantities of the season United have suffered five Premier league defeats before the New Year for the first time in over a decade and the embarrassing defeat at home to lowly Leeds United was the worst result in the club&rsquo;s recent history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />With &pound;75m at his disposal according to Sir Alex (although many would dispute this), a creative midfielder must be bought. One wonders what United would achieve if they had somebody like Cesc Fabregas in a team already containing Rooney, Ferdinand and Evra.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Portsmouth</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: &nbsp;F</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Four wins with the marquee 2-0 win over Liverpool are the only bright spots in what has been a miserable season so far for the South coast club.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />The players aren&rsquo;t being paid on time and subsequently are disillusioned and this is showing on the pitch. There is enough quality in the squad to stay up when compared with their contemporaries but the deep uncertainty behind the scenes is badly affecting the squad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Paying their players on time would be a start. Debt may force them into selling some of their stars and this would lead to an almost unavoidable relegation.</span></p>\n<p>Stoke City</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Their defence, an inspired Thomas Sorensen leads a Stoke defence which has conceded just 26 goals in 21 games a more than admirable record. Five home wins has them in 11th place, one better than last year&rsquo;s impressive debut finish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Their attack. A miserable 19 goals in 21 games just isn&rsquo;t good enough. Their five strikers have 8 goals between them with the top scorer honours being shared by Dave Kitson and Tuncay Sanli with an unimpressive 2 goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />A replacement keeper for the in demand Sorensen may be necessary but otherwise Stoke should be fine and don&rsquo;t need to spend any cash this transfer window.</span></p>\n<p>Sunderland</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.II</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />The signing of Darren Bent was high risk for &pound;10m but he has duly delivered with 14 league goals registered already this campaign. Five home wins is again a high point but just one away is more than worrying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />An injury to Lee Cattermole has had more of an effect on Sunderland than most would have predicted. A lowly 13th for a squad possessing as much quality as they have must put manager Steve Bruce under pressure. 10 losses is a bad statistic for a team with aspirations of a top half finish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />A new goalkeeper to replace the injury prone Craig Gordon and a centre midfielder to replace the influential Lee Cattermole are the Black Cats&rsquo; priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Tottenham Hotspur</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Solid at the back and scoring goals for fun, Spurs occupy a top 4 place at the half way point of the season albeit only on goal difference. 14 goals from Jermaine Defoe is an excellent return but they must get more from Robbie Keane (6 goals) and Peter Crouch (4 goals) if they are to maintain their challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Avoidable home defeats to Stoke and Wolves have Spurs a few points shy of where they should be. The fitness of Ledley King is again in doubt and Spurs look worse without him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Harry Redknapp is famous for his transfer dealings and &lsquo;Houdini&rsquo; may need to conjure up a few tricks to give Spurs the edge in the Champions League race.</span></p>\n<p>West Ham United</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.II</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Gianfranco Zola has his young squad playing nice football and they are beginning to turn the corner now. The fitness of experienced players like Robert Green, Scott Parker and Matthew Upson is vital to the Hammers&rsquo; prospects of surviving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Uncertainty at board room level has dogged the club all season and is affecting the players. West Ham&rsquo;s usually solid home form is below expectations this season with only 3 home wins.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />A quick decision on who is going to buy the club is needed so Zola is given as much time as possible to get new signings in, otherwise West Ham could be in trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Wigan Athletic</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.II</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Hugo Rodallega has again scored crucial goals for the cause, three away wins is a positive point but only three home wins from 10 games must be a concern.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Although Wigan are relatively safe from relegation one wonders should they be performing better under new boss Roberto Martinez. An appalling 44 goals conceded in 20 games is the main problem for Martinez&rsquo;s charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />As previously mentioned Wigan defensively this season have been a shambles and Martinez has acted quickly signing centre back Steven Caldwell from &nbsp;Celtic, more of the same must follow if they are to consolidate in the middle of the table</span></p>\n<p>Wolverhampton Wanderers</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />One of the favourites to go down Wolves have surprised a few observers being place just outside the relegation zone after 22 games. Crucial home wins against Burnley and Bolton must be replicated later in the season if Mick McCarthy&rsquo;s men are to escape the drop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />A paltry 17 goals in 22 games is a dreadful return for any Premier League side. Only ex-Cork City man Kevin Doyle has managed to score more than one goal (5 goals) from their five recognised forwards. 12 losses, second most in the league is a very worrying statistic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />A striker to support Doyle must be signed. If he was to get injured, the other four forwards combined have scored just 2 league goals this season. His fitness could be the key to Wolves&rsquo; survival bid.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "Imageurl": "<p><strong>\n</strong></p><p>Arsenal</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Arsene Wenger&rsquo;s youth policy has been vindicated (almost).

He is crucial to Hull&rsquo;s chance of safety, and average of 2 goals conceded per game hasn&rsquo;t helped. Four points from 11 away games isn&rsquo;t a great record and needs to be improved.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Hull have weaknesses all over the park but it is in the middle where they are lacking most when Bullard is not fit. The old adage appears again though: How do you replace the irreplaceable?</span></p>\n<p>Liverpool</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: III</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />From a purely subjective point of view? Everything! Objectively it is heartening to see the fans standing by their manager and realising despite the media hype that he only picks the team and cannot be held accountable for lack of form and effort from some of his senior professionals. Mr. Gerrard knows what I&rsquo;m talking about.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Careless spending by Rafael Benitez has put his side in a perilous position. Spending &pound;20m on a player not available for the first two months of the season is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the eccentric Spaniard&rsquo;s transfer dealings. Liverpool have been in this position before in 2005 when they actually failed to make the top four but success in the European Cup allowed them to receive special dispensation to compete in the competition the following year. An early exit means there is no such get out clause this time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Squad strengthening is the only way forward for Benitez and he has already shown signs of movement with the free transfer deal for Argentinian international Maxi Rodriguez. It is questionable whether funds are available to buy in January and if this is the case with a long term injury to Fernando Torres it will be a long second half of the season for the Merseyside club.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Manchester City</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />The signings of Roberto Mancini as manager and Carlos Tevez. City have been transformed from a mid-table side under Mark Hughes to potential title contenders under Mancio almost overnight it seems. A comprehensive 2-0 loss to Everton this weekend brought their fans back down to Earth but they will be over their blue moon if they can knock local rivals Manchester United out of the League Cup and secure a first trophy since 1976.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />What must be the most expensively assembled defence ever has conceded a disappointing 30 goals in just 21 games and but for the form of Shay Given it could be much worse. An injury to Joleon Lescott appears to have sparked a change in City&rsquo;s fortunes though. An expensive flop for just &pound;24m at the time of print.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />With a limitless source of money City can afford to buy every other club in the Premier League and still have change in the billions. Needless to say any gaps that Mancini feels his side has will be filled by an expensive potentially world class signing.</span></p>\n<p>Manchester United</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Wayne Rooney finally delivering the goals his talent has promised and Ryan Giggs continuing his excellent form from last season have been high points in a stop-start season for the champions. Have encountered many obstacles this season including the worst injury crisis seen in Ferguson&rsquo;s 23 years but the fact they are still contending on almost all fronts is a testament to the squad the old master has built.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />The aforementioned injury crisis. With almost &pound;100m worth of players unavailable for large quantities of the season United have suffered five Premier league defeats before the New Year for the first time in over a decade and the embarrassing defeat at home to lowly Leeds United was the worst result in the club&rsquo;s recent history.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />With &pound;75m at his disposal according to Sir Alex (although many would dispute this), a creative midfielder must be bought. One wonders what United would achieve if they had somebody like Cesc Fabregas in a team already containing Rooney, Ferdinand and Evra.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Portsmouth</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: &nbsp;F</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Four wins with the marquee 2-0 win over Liverpool are the only bright spots in what has been a miserable season so far for the South coast club.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />The players aren&rsquo;t being paid on time and subsequently are disillusioned and this is showing on the pitch. There is enough quality in the squad to stay up when compared with their contemporaries but the deep uncertainty behind the scenes is badly affecting the squad.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Paying their players on time would be a start. Debt may force them into selling some of their stars and this would lead to an almost unavoidable relegation.</span></p>\n<p>Stoke City</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Their defence, an inspired Thomas Sorensen leads a Stoke defence which has conceded just 26 goals in 21 games a more than admirable record. Five home wins has them in 11th place, one better than last year&rsquo;s impressive debut finish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Their attack. A miserable 19 goals in 21 games just isn&rsquo;t good enough. Their five strikers have 8 goals between them with the top scorer honours being shared by Dave Kitson and Tuncay Sanli with an unimpressive 2 goals.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />A replacement keeper for the in demand Sorensen may be necessary but otherwise Stoke should be fine and don&rsquo;t need to spend any cash this transfer window.</span></p>\n<p>Sunderland</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.II</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />The signing of Darren Bent was high risk for &pound;10m but he has duly delivered with 14 league goals registered already this campaign. Five home wins is again a high point but just one away is more than worrying.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />An injury to Lee Cattermole has had more of an effect on Sunderland than most would have predicted. A lowly 13th for a squad possessing as much quality as they have must put manager Steve Bruce under pressure. 10 losses is a bad statistic for a team with aspirations of a top half finish.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />A new goalkeeper to replace the injury prone Craig Gordon and a centre midfielder to replace the influential Lee Cattermole are the Black Cats&rsquo; priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Tottenham Hotspur</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Solid at the back and scoring goals for fun, Spurs occupy a top 4 place at the half way point of the season albeit only on goal difference. 14 goals from Jermaine Defoe is an excellent return but they must get more from Robbie Keane (6 goals) and Peter Crouch (4 goals) if they are to maintain their challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Avoidable home defeats to Stoke and Wolves have Spurs a few points shy of where they should be. The fitness of Ledley King is again in doubt and Spurs look worse without him.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />Harry Redknapp is famous for his transfer dealings and &lsquo;Houdini&rsquo; may need to conjure up a few tricks to give Spurs the edge in the Champions League race.</span></p>\n<p>West Ham United</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.II</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Gianfranco Zola has his young squad playing nice football and they are beginning to turn the corner now. The fitness of experienced players like Robert Green, Scott Parker and Matthew Upson is vital to the Hammers&rsquo; prospects of surviving.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Uncertainty at board room level has dogged the club all season and is affecting the players. West Ham&rsquo;s usually solid home form is below expectations this season with only 3 home wins.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />A quick decision on who is going to buy the club is needed so Zola is given as much time as possible to get new signings in, otherwise West Ham could be in trouble.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Wigan Athletic</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.II</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />Hugo Rodallega has again scored crucial goals for the cause, three away wins is a positive point but only three home wins from 10 games must be a concern.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />Although Wigan are relatively safe from relegation one wonders should they be performing better under new boss Roberto Martinez. An appalling 44 goals conceded in 20 games is the main problem for Martinez&rsquo;s charges.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />As previously mentioned Wigan defensively this season have been a shambles and Martinez has acted quickly signing centre back Steven Caldwell from &nbsp;Celtic, more of the same must follow if they are to consolidate in the middle of the table</span></p>\n<p>Wolverhampton Wanderers</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Grade: II.I</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone right?<br />One of the favourites to go down Wolves have surprised a few observers being place just outside the relegation zone after 22 games. Crucial home wins against Burnley and Bolton must be replicated later in the season if Mick McCarthy&rsquo;s men are to escape the drop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">What&rsquo;s gone wrong?<br />A paltry 17 goals in 22 games is a dreadful return for any Premier League side. Only ex-Cork City man Kevin Doyle has managed to score more than one goal (5 goals) from their five recognised forwards. 12 losses, second most in the league is a very worrying statistic.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Solution:<br />A striker to support Doyle must be signed. If he was to get injured, the other four forwards combined have scored just 2 league goals this season. His fitness could be the key to Wolves&rsquo; survival bid.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "523", "Heading": "Premiership Half Term Report"}
