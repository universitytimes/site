{"Body": "Peter Murphy\n\nSo as Irish rugby continues its roller coaster ride with an emphatic victory over England, we are again flying high, Declan Kidneys side doing enough to take the pressure off after a disappointing Six nations. If, as people say, you are only as good as your last performance, Kidney will be delighted. This is the perfect time to reflect and, indeed, to look ahead and assess our chances in the upcoming world cup. So, as the attention is now shifting back to the provinces and the Heineken cup, is it here the answer lies? Or does it lie with Kidney and his approach over the next few months?\n\nThe first question is, was the England match a once off? England rolled onto town on a high, yet the Irish tend to up their game for England, so it was a predictable result, factoring in England&rsquo;s inexperienced squad and history of slipping up at the final hurdle in Lansdowne road. So, this result I believe, showed us what we all knew Ireland were capable of. That was the frustrating thing about their recent performances, we knew they were capable of more.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2768\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Ireland celebrate 6 Nations victory in 2009\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IrelandGrandSlam2009PA.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2768\" title=\"IrelandGrandSlam2009PA\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/IrelandGrandSlam2009PA-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nIndeed there has been much criticism of Declan Kidney lately. Such as, is he making the best use of his squad? He knows better than the press about who&rsquo;s going well in training, but what about form Heineken cup players such as Fergus McFadden? Surely Ireland could benefit more with him on the bench as opposed to Paddy Wallace. With one of O&rsquo;Gara or Sexton on the bench, outhalf is covered, and the argument that he covers fullback doesn&rsquo;t hold water, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. On the rare occasion he&rsquo;s played this position for Ulster, he has been unsure under highballs. And Kidney seems reluctant to give him game time, why then, is he on the bench? Andrew Trimble is another whom many couldn&rsquo;t understand why he was not in the match day twenty two. Then he&rsquo;s starting against England, and, by all accounts played very well. Our chances depend very much on Mike Ross&rsquo;s fitness, as Ireland have no real alternative at tighthead. By no means is Ross the complete tighthead, yet he is doing a great job in the teams problem position. Which again begs the question, why was he not selected in the autumn? Players such as McFadden and Trimble need game time in competitive matches with the World Cup approaching. This is for them to gel and develop in the teams game plan, as they already have the necessary experience from the Heineken Cup. Another issue, in this respect, is the inclusion of Denis leamy on the bench. He is not the player to come on and change a game, and you would think the return of Ferris will see him demoted. Todays game is a squad game, with the tactical use of the bench a necessity, yet Kidney did not make use of this during the championship. This may be to Irelands detriment come September.\n\nIt is my opinion that we have never gone into a World Cup in a better position than this, yet that was the belief last time when Ireland drastically underperformed, looking short of game time from the first match. This time, however is different. One such point is the panic surrounding Brian O&rsquo;Driscolls injury a month before the last World Cup. While he is still a key player, we are better equipped this time around to deal with injuries. Indeed I believe injuries are better timed this time around. Players such as Heaslip have been injured and returned, my hope would be that this would have offered a chance for rest and will allow a smooth run in to the event. It also let Ireland explore their squad depth, with Sean O&rsquo;Brien proving that he is a more than capable deputy in the number eight jersey.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_2769\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The last World Cup victors\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/win.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2769\" title=\"win\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/win-300x216.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nAnother issue that presented itself was who to play at outhalf. Here I believe Kidney made a mistake. As calls to start O&rsquo;Gara came from certain areas of the press and public, he obliged. Yet his later actions (reinstating Sexton after Rog&rsquo;s good performance) showed he still saw Sexton as number one. His tactic of starting one and introducing the other early in the second half will not work if O&rsquo;Gara starts. He is the man you want to see out the game, or indeed to come on to turn it around if needed. Sexton is more of a confidence player, whereas O&rsquo;Gara with all his experience has the steely determination needed to deal with a team on the back foot, kicking them into better positions and bringing a calming influence to the outhalf role. If Ireland are to employ an attacking mindset, as is needed to overcome the southern hemisphere teams, Sexton should start. This no means a reflection on O&rsquo;Gara, simply a tactical call.\n\nFinally, a good run for Leinster and Ulster in the Knockout stages of the Heineken Cup and Munster in the Amlin will be key to Irelands chances at the World Cup. A winning atmosphere will be needed, and I have no doubt that both Leinster and Munster will be looking to win their respective tournaments. But much will depend on Kidney and his proven ability to motivate teams to do just enough to get by. I for one am optimistic that we will finally reach the semi finals, a much overdue achievement.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"480\" height=\"390\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4D20Ksgpsbw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>", "Imageurl": "2770", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "2767", "Heading": "Rugby World Cup - Win or Lose"}
