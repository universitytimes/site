The rustiness showed itself in the first five minutes, with Guinness using their aggressive forward pack to dominate the opening possession and territory. However, due to backline handling errors, they were unable to capitalise on good opportunities.\n\nAfter weathering the initial storm, the Trinity backline began to dominate proceedings. Fly-half Ibrahim Bouihouj landed a penalty after good running from fullback Liam Townsend was met with an illegal high tackle by the Guinness defence. Guinness&rsquo; lack of discipline\u00a0 continued, as referee Michael Nulty blew persistently for offside and infringements at the breakdown.\n\nHowever Guinness kept the possession tight with the forwards for long periods. Strong running by the Guinness back row resulted number eight, David Lennon, crashing over from five yards. Inside centre Craig Courtney converted to give Guinness a four point lead.\n\nPenalties continued to plague Guinness, as Bouihouj landed a tough kick from the touchline following a series of good continuity from the Trinity pack resulted in another breakdown infringement.\n\nTrinity had the better of the play through the first half, but indecisiveness coupled with handling errors left them trailing 7-6 at the break. Trinity managed to improve very early in the second half, as timely counter-rucking by the back row allowed out-half Bouihouj to evade several tacklers and canter under the posts. Bourahj added the extras for a 13-7 lead. Things got steadily worse for Guinness, as their captain Eddie Jacobs was sin-binned after Mr Nulty grew tired of the persistent fouling at ruck time. They persevered however,with aggressive play from the forwards resulting in a successful penalty attempt from Courtney.\n\nThe Trinity defense began to grow weary due to consistent play by the Guinness backline. Courtney had a try recalled after a questionable pass was given forward by Mr Nulty. From the resulting\n\nscrum, bad communication on Trinity&rsquo;s behalf allowed Guinness scrumhalf Brendan O&rsquo;Hagan to capitalize on a loose ball and scramble over the line. Courtney converted to give Guinness a 17-13 lead.\n\nTrinity threatened relentlessly from the restart, with captain Scott McGeraghty and blindside flanker Cian Flanagan leading well from the front. Strong running from fullback Townsend created opportunities for Trinity, but handling errors from several players meant they couldn&rsquo;t fully capitalize. Through the remainder of the match, Trinity remained camped in the Guinness half for long periods. However continuous errors from the backline, coupled with resolute Guinness defending, meant the visitors finished the scrappy encounter on top.\n\nTrinity will need to rectify their handling mistakes and discipline if they want to stand a chance of figuring prominently in the remainder of the campaign, with sides of all standards struggling in recent fixtures.\n\nFinal score: Trinity 13 - 17 Guinness\n<div></div>", "Imageurl": "265", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "264", "Heading": "Guinness defeat Trinity in scrappy Santry encounter"}
