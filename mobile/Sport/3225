Although it is a  developmental contract, I will still be training with the full squad,  and have opportunities to play for the first team, with the hopes of  parlaying this developmental contract into something more'' said Lavalla to EaglesXV, the website of the US Eagles national team.\n\nIt is an exciting development in the career of the former sports scholar, whose hopes of making the Eagles squad for the World Cup in New Zealand in November have been boosted by a run in the first-team in the Churchill Cup, a competition which pits the Eagles against Canada, England Saxons, Ireland Wolfhounds, and formerly the New Zealand Maori.\n\n'Scott was a very popular member of the College community during his time here', said UT Sports editor Jack Leahy, 'you don't get guys more down-to-earth than Scott and he was extremely hard-working on and off the pitch. He's a great player and a great guy who deserves every ounce of the success that comes his way'.\n\nOn behalf of the entire College community, we wish Scott the best in Paris and in New Zealand - just not when he comes up against Ireland in New Plymouth on September 11th!", "Imageurl": "3228", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "3225", "Heading": "Scott Lavalla lands Stade Francais Deal"}
