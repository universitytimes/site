{"Body": "Dublin University &ndash; 7\r\n\r\nGalway Corinthians &ndash; 25\r\n\r\nA very &lsquo;new look&rsquo; Trinity rugby team took to the field for the first game of the season on Saturday afternoon. With a large contingent of experienced players having left the college side in the last year, DUFC&rsquo;s second season in the Ulster Bank League Division 1B looks to be a much more challenging prospect than their previous campaign. The &lsquo;home&rsquo; side will also be playing their games off campus this season, as College Park undergoes redevelopment; Sydney Parade, the home of Monkstown Rugby Club, will serve as Trinity&rsquo;s base for the coming year.\r\n\r\nTheir opposition for the day were Corinthians, from Galway, who had won promotion to Division 1B this year, and in previous meetings with Trinity, they had always presented a strong front, and given the students a tough game. Saturday proved to be no different, as the visiting side left Dublin with four points.\r\n\r\nTrinity started the game on unsure footing. A strong, and more fluid, Corinthians team made the home team work hard in defence, and pressed the students back on many occasions. The opening score was a long range penalty from Corinthians&rsquo; Sean O&rsquo;Hagan, just over ten minutes in. DUFC did begin to build from here, showing something in the way of consistent forward progress. Trinity made a number of breaks, pushing down the field well, with the backs finding some rhythm and the forwards building phases through solid rucking. A notable move of the drive was a &lsquo;pick and go&rsquo; from hooker Richie Halpin, followed by a neat offload. The period of good play paid dividends; Trinity forced their way to the goal line and lock forward, Andy Keating, touched down just right of the post. Conor Kearns added the conversion to make it 7-3.\r\n\r\nCorinthians were more free flowing in their play, and began to turn the screw as the half wore on. Some resolute defending from Trinity, and forced penalties, kept the visitors out on a few occasions. The Galway team added another penalty, making it 7-6 at the half.\r\n\r\nCorinthians started the second half as they finished the first. O&rsquo;Hagan missed a penalty, but made up for his mistake by making some darting runs through the Trinity cover. A spectacular skip pass from the out-half found winger, Ivan Venter, who scored in the corner. O&rsquo;Hagan added a second try himself after intercepting an unconvincing Trinity pass. He converted to make it 7-18. Flanker Aaron Conneely scored Corinthians third try, and the conversion brought the score to 7-25.\r\n\r\nTrinity centre Ariel Robles found the sin bin for intentionally slapping the ball away, and some brighter play in the last few minutes was unfortunately not enough to get DUFC over the line again.\r\n\r\nThis is a Trinity squad that is most definitely in the development stage. With a lot of new faces in the starting XV, there are bound to be some teething problems. While losing the opening game of the season is never ideal, there will be plenty of chances for recovery for the college team.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DSC_0485.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "19743", "Heading": "Losing Start for DUFC"}
