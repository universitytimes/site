would be to give an unappreciative sense of undeviating movement to the word.\u00a0 Dilger consistently game after game cleans up scrappy and untidy ball by taking the dross possession up to the heart of the defensive line.\u00a0 It may not be pretty and may not get recognition from fans more used to watching more dynamic runners such as Hanratty or Adelokun but their undertakings couldn&rsquo;t happen without Dilger&rsquo;s directness.\n\nTrinity got their first points four minutes into the first half when Fanagan made an excellent break from his own half and was hauled down outside the Bruff 10 metre line.\u00a0 Bruff went off their feet attempting to remove Du Toit and Marsh duly added the penalty.\u00a0 Trinity lacked patience and focus but got another penalty when Bruff went in the side at the halfway and Marsh again pinged it to make it 6-0.\u00a0 Then after a penalty for offside from a kick again at the 10 metre line Marsh made it 9-0.\u00a0 Bruff got their first points at the start of the second half after a good carry-run from Cosgrove was rewarded when Lavelle went off his feet.\u00a0 Marsh responded immediately when Du Toit forced Bruff to concede a penalty for infringing at the breakdown.\u00a0 That made it 12-3 and despite the Limerick side&rsquo;s multiple expeditions into the Trinity red-zone the students defence never yielded to give away a try.\n\nAs a result of the pressure exerted upon the Trinity line, the students gave away numerous penalties that referee John Peak should have punished with a yellow card.\u00a0 More remarkable than his reluctance to sinbin infringers was the passivity of the home crowd who seemed to accept elements of Trinity&rsquo;s cynical defense as part and parcel of the game.\u00a0 Munster crowds are well known for the vocal hostility and teams such as Garryowen or Young Munster wouldn&rsquo;t have needed reminding that this was a student team perhaps susceptible to the clich\u00e9 that university sides lack mental toughness.\u00a0 DUFC don&rsquo;t fit that bill.\u00a0 In seven days they play Malone.\u00a0 The Ulster outfit will have Robbie Diack, Niall O&rsquo;Connor and Conor Joyce all lining out for them.\u00a0 It is fifty days to Christmas but a win against Malone will see it come early for Trinity.\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "13235", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13234", "Heading": "Du Toit Inspires DUFC to Victory in Tough Venture South"}
