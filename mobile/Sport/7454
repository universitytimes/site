You have to put up with people all around discussing how \"their\" teams are doing in foreign leagues and are looked down on for supporting a team from your own league. Your local team.\n\u00a0\nWhat puzzles me most is the sense of entitlement that Irish fans of teams from Manchester, London and even Glasgow have to brag about the exploits of foreign sides. I find that a sly \"What part of Manchester are you from?\" usually silences them!\n\u00a0\nI have nothing against foreign football or even the English Premier League, I enjoy watching Match of the Day when I can. However, why must it breed such utter disregard for our own league?\n\u00a0\nI was a Spurs fan from the age of nine until I realised that the connection I had with them was forced at best and that you can't really choose who you support. Tottenham Hotspur were my team and now they travelled to Tallaght to play Shamrock Rovers.\n\nAs a Pat's fan, I'm not exactly Rovers' biggest supporter but it gave me immense pleasure to see them take the lead at White Hart Lane in the return fixture a few months back. It wasn't to work out for them that night, or indeed in any of their previous Europa League group games. However, they have been far from outclassed. They have found the net against each team in the group, unlucky not to pick up points along the way.\n\u00a0\nSpurs were convincing winners on Thursday, overcoming Rovers 4-0. The capacity crowd sang on, never discouraged, giving manager Michael O'Neill the send off he deserved as he leaves the club. Rovers made history by reaching this stage of the competition and though they have been unsuccessful, they have done the league great credit.\n\u00a0\nIrish EPL fans will point to the obvious gap in quality to justify their support. While a gap exists, I've never found it do hinder the entertainment quality. It's why I support Ireland and not Spain. It's why I supported my school's teams and not hose who actually used to win. It's why people all around the county travel to see their local GAA clubs play instead of those who will inevitably win the provincial and national titles. A connection is not something that you can choose.\n\u00a0\nPeople all around the world follow their local teams. It's a source of pride and excitment for them. In Ireland, we look to England. This irks me to the extent that I get more than a bit embarrassed when I see Irish people wearing the jerseys of English clubs. When I hear kids bragging about United's latest win because they chose to support one of the biggest teams in the world.\n\u00a0\nThe League of Ireland season starts in March. To the begrudgers, the naysayers and the bar-stoolers, I ask; \"Have you given it a chance?\" To paraphrase Brian Kerr; \"No matter how comfortable your armchair, no matter how big your TV, nothing beats real live football.\"", "Imageurl": "7456", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "7454", "Heading": "In a league of its own"}
