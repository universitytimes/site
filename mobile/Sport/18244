The result was a match that was difficult to watch for any Irish fan.\n\nIrish nerves were put on edge when Shane Williams went over for the first try of the game just 2 minutes into play, while Rhys Priestland kicked over the conversion to give Wales the immediate advantage.\n\nThe Irish put on the pressure but failed to use it successfully and exploit Welsh indiscipline.\n\nThree Irish penalty opportunities were wasted on kicks to corners for the first half, which resulted in no scores. These missed opportunities were to be the status quo for the match. A near try from Cian Healy was brought down by a hard hit from Alun Wyn-Jones and Luke Charteris and a lack of support meant that he couldn&rsquo;t make the offload.\n\nA cut through the midfield by Gordon D&rsquo;Arcy in the 15<sup>th</sup> minute was also wasted as he was surrounded by three men in red. Sean O&rsquo;Brien got over the line but was held up, admirably, by a man half his size in Williams. Ireland had the stats to show they dominated in territory and possession. The only issue was the score.\n\nRonan O&rsquo;Gara finally brought Ireland onto the board with a 24<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-size: 11px;\">th-</span>minute penalty which was to be our only score of the first half. A penalty from Priestland brought the half time score to 10-3 to the Welshmen.\n\nA quick try scored by the impressive Keith Earls 4 minutes after the restart, thanks to a messy backline move, restored some Irish confidence. O&rsquo;Gara&rsquo;s conversion drew us level for the first time in the game.\n\nWelsh Scrum Half Mike Philips countered quickly and went over for Wales&rsquo; second try of the game in the 50<sup>th</sup> minute with a dart down the blind side of the ruck, straight past an oblivious D&rsquo;Arcy. Priestland&rsquo;s conversion hit off the post and the Irish fans clutched on to the hope of another try and a possible lead. It was not to be.\n\nThe Welsh defence was nigh on impenetrable. They targeted key Irish players, keeping them isolated and off the ball. O&rsquo;Driscoll, O&rsquo;Gara, Rob Kearney, Stephen Ferris and Tommy Bowe found themselves flanked by red time and time again.\n\nGatland&rsquo;s side only increased their lead in the 64<sup>th</sup> minute after Jonathan Davies scored a try that had no right to happen, cutting through not one, but four of Irelands top defenders: Kearney, replacement Eoin Reddan, Earls, and Healy.\n\nPriestland yet again hit the post, but the Welsh still had a 12 point lead and 15 minutes on the clock with which to defend it.\n\nThe Irish proceeded to throw everything they had into breaking through the defence, building up the phases and earning turnovers. A jinx pass from Reddan to O&rsquo;Brien nearly saw us score but was halted 3 metres short, only for Healy to concede a penalty at the scrum.\n\nGatland&rsquo;s side simply had the superior game-plan, fitness, technical skill and drive.\n\nThe set piece plays just did not go our way. Paul O&rsquo;Connell and Donnacha O&rsquo;Callaghan took the line-outs well but would then knock the ball back to a player who&rsquo;d fumble. The success of the scrum against Australia failed to be emulated. Jamie Roberts stormed through Irish defenders with terrifying ease as his team mates patiently built up the phases.\n\nBy the time the full time whistle was blown the despair was written across the squad&rsquo;s faces. What was to date our best opportunity in a World Cup was lost.\n\nI might be killed if I&rsquo;m spotted inFront Square after saying this, but the better team won.\n\nWe tried. Lord knows we tried. But it was not to be.\n\nDespite our loss is it our most successful World Cup to date. We topped the table, destroyed Australia, and put any questions which followed an iffy summer season behind us. And we got the support of the Kiwis themselves. That is no mean feat. The entire country, including the emigrants in the southern hemisphere who were by far the best supporters of the entire tournament, has once again gotten behind Ireland's best national team.\n\nThe challenge now is to recollect ourselves, not let this effect confidence, learn from it and apply it to the Six Nations.\n\nBut that doesn&rsquo;t mean this loss will hurt any less.", "Imageurl": "5057", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "18244", "Heading": "In loving memory of Ireland&#039;s World Cup Campaign"}
