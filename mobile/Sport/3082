{"Body": "<p lang=\"en-US\">Jack Leahy -</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Like most football fans, the poorly-scheduled money-spinning international friendlies and repetitive qualifiers that encroach on early June mean next to nothing to me. For that reason, I'm going to pretend that they're not even happening and focus on something a little more exciting: the soon-to-open Premier League transfer window (Pause for edge-of-seat anticipation)! With no exams to inhibit the full expression of my footballing self, few friends and no hobbies, I'm going to take a look at the top six Premier League teams and hazard a few guesses as to their recruitment policies over the summer.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Manchester United</span></strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">With Paul Scholes, Edwin van der Sar, Gary Neville, and Owen Hargreaves already having left the 19-times champions, it is likely to be a summer of unprecedented activity in the transfer market for Sir Alex Ferguson; Ferguson must look to rebuild a side whose flaws were ruthlessly exposed by Barcelona in the Champions League final.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>What they need:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Two midfielders and a goalkeeper will be the top priorities for David Gill and Sir Alex this summer. Despite the conventional unconvincing denial of rumours, Athletico Madrid's <strong>David de Gea</strong> looks set to fill Edwin van der Sar's number one jersey as the iconic Dutchman hangs up his gloves at the age of 40. As for the midfield, the big-name ambition is to replace Scholes with Inter Milan's <strong>Wesley Sneijder</strong> or Tottenham's <strong>Luka Modric</strong>; many are those who would argue that both are required should United wish to rival Barcelona on the European stage. Ferguson is also believed to be one of many managers contemplating a \u014140million move for Tottenham's <strong>Gareth Bale</strong>, while rumours concerning Aston Villa's <strong>A</strong><strong>shley Young</strong>, Valencia's <strong>Juan Mata</strong>, and Udinese's Chilean winger <strong>Alexis Sanchez </strong>refuse to die.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3083\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"281\" caption=\"Sneijder: A direct replacement for Scholes?\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/sneijder.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3083\" title=\"sneijder\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/sneijder.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"281\" height=\"180\" /></a>[/caption]\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Pack your bags:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">With Michael Owen now tied to United for another year, it is difficult to imagine that <strong>Dimitar Berbatov </strong>fits into Fergie's plans, despite an uncharacteristically determined stance for the Bulgarian striker, who insists that he wishes to remain at Old Trafford despite a conspicuous Champions League final snub. <strong>Wes Brown </strong>and <strong>Jonny Evans </strong>really ought to be replaced in defense, while <strong>Darron Gibson</strong>, <strong>Gabriel Obertan</strong>, <strong>B\u00e9b\u00e9</strong>, and Tom\u00e1s Kusczak will surely be shown the door sooner rather than later. Of the three strikers returning from loan &ndash; Federico Macheda, Marme Briam Diouf, and Danny Welbeck &ndash; <strong>Diouf </strong>should count himself as occupying the most precarious position.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Chelsea</span></strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>What they need:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">A manager. <strong>Gus Hiddink </strong>has and always will be the man sounded out for the position, but should the enigmatic Dutchman choose to honour his commitment to the Turkish FA, Chelsea may look to ex-Fulham boss Mark Hughes or Hiddink's compatriot Marco van Basten. In terms of players, a new striker will be needed to provide consistently in compensation for Didier Drogba's age and Fernando Torres' inconsistency, while the midfield is in need of rejuvenation. Chelsea are always difficult to predict in the transfer market, but they'll definitely have a serious look at Anderlecht's <strong>Romelu Lukaku</strong>, long-term targets <strong>Gregory van der Wiel</strong> and <strong>Neymar</strong>, and Real Mardid's <strong>Kaka</strong>.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Pack your bags:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This summer could see a massive clear-out from a side who failed to maintain a title challenge when it was required last season. The most interesting rumours concern the future of Didier Drogba, who isn't getting any younger and seems to be wanted more at Tottenham and Real Madrid than at Chelsea. <strong>Florient Malouda </strong>and <strong>Nicolas Anelka</strong>, although fantastically talented footballers, may also make way. <strong>Jose Boswinga</strong> (Juventus?) and <strong>Yuri Zhirkov</strong> will most likely bring mediocre Chelsea careers to an end this summer, as should <strong>Paolo Ferreira</strong> (QPR?).</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Ferreira.jpg\"></a></p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3084\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"189\" caption=\"Ferreira: doomed\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Ferreira.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3084\" title=\"Ferreira\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Ferreira.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"189\" height=\"266\" /></a>[/caption]\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Manchester City</span></strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>What they need:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">This doesn't even bear considering, especially for a partisan of the red half of Manchester. Some great things have happened on Eastlands this year following the signings of B-listers David Silva, Alexandir Kolarov etc. last season, so expect Roberto Mancini to go all out for the A-list stars now that Champions League football is ensured. The usual rumours concern <strong>Zlatan</strong><strong> Ibrahimovic</strong>, <strong>Kaka</strong>, <strong>Cesc Fabregas</strong> and <strong>Gareth Bale</strong>; expect perhaps one huge name and solid erstwhile recruitment from this fast-maturing side.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3085\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"128\" caption=\"A typical scene at Manchester City training\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Money.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3085\" title=\"Money\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Money.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"93\" /></a>[/caption]\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Pack your bags:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">The next target for City's Arab owners is surely the Premier League trophy, so players who are not up to that standard will be mercilessly evicted. Long-tern fringe players <strong>Wayne Bridge</strong>, <strong>J</strong><strong>\u00f4</strong>, <strong>Michael Johnson</strong>, <strong>Shay Given</strong>, <strong>Craig Bellamy</strong>, <strong>Fernando Calceido </strong>and <strong>Nedum Onuoha </strong>will be let go without much of a fight, but want-away captain <strong>Carlos Tevez </strong>is an extremely valuable asset to the Eastlands side and they will hope to hold off interest from Italian side Inter Milan and retain the diminutive Argentine's valuable services.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Arsenal</span></strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>What they need:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">Where to start? Definitely the weakest squad of the top five sides last season, the Gunners are lacking all over the pitch in terms of both quality and leadership, and it will require a fundamental shift in Arsene Wenger's transfer policy to revive a side who somehow managed to finish fourth in what was a two-horse race. The major priorities will be a commanding centre-back, a Patrick Vieira-style midfielder, a solid goalkeeper and a 20-goal striker. Bolton's <strong>Gary</strong> <strong>Cahill</strong> will be the prime target to plug the holes at the back, possibly in front of <strong>Shay</strong> <strong>Given</strong>, given (no pun intended) that Pepe Reina has credibly pledged his future to Liverpool. <strong>Scott</strong> <strong>Parker</strong> could add vigour to a fatally inexperienced midfield. The biggest name linked with the North Londoners this summer is that of Real Madrid's <strong>Karim</strong> <strong>Benzema</strong>, a victim of Real's extraordinary ability to suspend the progress of quality players. The Frenchman would perform the out-and-out goal-scoring role that remains vacant since Thierry Henry left for Barcelona in 2006 but would probably cost in excess of \u014120million.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Pack your bags:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">...half the squad, should Wenger wish to address the problems at the heart of his team. Players like <strong>Tomas Rosicky, Andrey Arshavin, Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9, Manuel Almunia</strong>, and <strong>Jonathan Djourou </strong>are nowhere near title-winning quality and will have to be mercilessly cut loose. Gunners fans will rush to hold the door open for <strong>Nikolas Bendtner</strong> and even pay for a one-way ticket to somewhere far, far away. <strong>Samir Nasri </strong>is a man whose heart belongs elsewhere, having just begun a game of cat-and-mouse with Manchester United. The biggest decision of Wenger's Arsenal career is that one which concerns the future of <strong>Cesc Fabregas</strong>; the Spaniard is a phenomenally talented player, but the astronomical revenue the Gunners could ask of his suitors (let's face it: Barcelona or bust) could be used to regenerate the squad. Pictures of Fabregas at the Spanish Grand Prix on the final, season-deciding day of the season raise questions as to the captain's dedication; you have to ask, would Vieira or Tony Adams have done that?</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3086\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"259\" caption=\"Captain Fabulous? Intentionally forlorn picture to imply impending departure\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fabregas.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3086\" title=\"fabregas\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fabregas.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></a>[/caption]\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tottenham Hotspur</span></strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>What they need:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">...is not necessarily what they will get. This will be an extremely important summer for Harry Redknapp's side; they harbour Champions League ambitions, but can no longer offer Champions League football. Brad Friedel's arrival from Aston Villa has probably killed rumours linking Spurs to Birmingham's <strong>Ben Foster</strong>. Up front, a near-total overhaul is on the cards, with Redknapp hot on the heels of <strong>Guissepe Rossi</strong>, prodigal son <strong>Dimitar Berbatov</strong>, free-agent <strong>Miroslav Klose</strong>, <strong>Didier Drogba </strong>and <strong>Diego Forlan</strong>. My two cents? <strong>Berbatov and Drogba</strong>; there is likely to be competition from the bigger clubs for Klose, Forlan, and Rossi, and Spurs may lose out as a result. On a separate note, which of the North London clubs will <strong>Scott Parker</strong> choose? And which of <strong>Parker </strong>and <strong>Charlie Adam</strong> will Spurs pursue with the most intent?</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3087\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"240\" caption=\"Can history repeat itself? As a history student, I say it can!\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Berba.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3087\" title=\"Berba\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Berba.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"359\" /></a>[/caption]\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Pack your bags:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">With the 25-man squad limit imposed by the Premier League, Spurs simply cannot afford to retain the services of both Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate, with <strong>Woodgate </strong>the obvious candidate for eviction.<strong> Roman Pavlyuchenko, Robbie Keane, and Peter Crouch</strong> have all had poor seasons in front of goal and will be happy to get out of White Heart Lane. There is genuine credibility to suggestions that Spurs will sacrifice the immobile <strong>Rafael van der Vaart</strong> to free up their midfield, but they certainly won't want to lose fellow star-names <strong>Gareth Bale, Sandro, and Luka Modric</strong>. It'd be a real statement of ambition to retain all three, but whether or not they can provide for their growing ambitions is doubtful.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Liverpool</span></strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>What they need:</strong></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\">New ownership and a new manager provide for a new era. Liverpool have been cursed in recent years by some uninspiring signings, but Kenny Daglish will hope to match the success of his acquisition of Luis Suarez with a few other big signings over the summer. He will be smart enough to look within England for proven Premier League players such as <strong>Charles N'Zogbia, Charlie Adam, Jordan Henderson, Ashley Young and Luis Enrique</strong>, but it remains to be seen whether or not he can tempt <strong>Leighton Baines</strong> to perform the ultimate betrayal and leave Everton for their great rivals. If there's one man in the world who can do it, it's Kenny, and a smart summer could thrust the Reds into contention for second or third place in the 2011-12 campaign.</p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"></p>\n<p lang=\"en-US\"><strong>Pack your bags:</strong></p>\nRemember I mentioned average signings?
