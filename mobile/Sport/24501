{"Body": "<strong>David Byrne |\u00a0</strong>Fencing Correspondent\r\n\r\nDublin University Fencing Club&rsquo;s intermediate team beat Pembroke earlier this month to win the inaugural Leinster Novice \u00c9p\u00e9e League final.\r\n\r\nThe league was established in September, featuring six teams: DUFC, Pembroke, FenceFit, Maynooth, Griffith College, and Blessington. The fencers from each team have two years or less experience fencing, and so it is an excellent platform providing fencers of similar levels competitive match experience. From September to December these six teams battled it out for a coveted place in February&rsquo;s final. The final had originally been scheduled for play in late January, however, it was pushed back until mid-February.\r\n\r\nDublin University Fencing Club (DUFC) were in fantastic form and finished 2013 as league leaders, undefeated in all of their matches, thereby securing their spot in the final. Pembroke FC finished the table in second place, suffering only one defeat in their league fixture against DUFC.\r\n\r\nHaving beaten Pembroke in their league fixture earlier in the season, DUFC had the psychological advantage going into the final. It was a close match, with the lead exchanged 5 times. DUFC started well, taking the lead in the first bout 4-3. Pembroke then went ahead, and the two teams were neck and neck going into the final bout, tied at 32-32. The lead switched twice in what was a thrilling final bout. DUFC&rsquo;s Fionn O&rsquo;Connor scored a phenomenal 13 points in the last bout to ensure victory for DUFC. The final score in the match was DUFC 45 &ndash; 42 Pembroke.\r\n\r\nThe Trinity team consisted of Fionn O&rsquo;Connor, Camille Hindsgaul, Tim Porter and David Byrne.<b>\u00a0</b>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_24502\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Fencing-Final-Duncan-Salter-640x360.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-24502\" alt=\"Trinity's fencers (black tops) with beaten finalists, Pembroke.

It is one of the oldest open fencing competitions in the UK, dating back to 1938. A record number of DUFC members made the trip to Liverpool, including four novices and two beginners.\r\n\r\nThe competition was fierce, with internationally experienced fencers competing for the silverware. Club captain, Max Milner, made it to the last eight on both days, but unfortunately missed out on any medals.\r\n\r\nSomething that has been a recurring feature this season has been the development and progression of our novices. The Merseyside Open 2014 provided another platform through which the hard work and individual growth of our novices was displayed. One beginner and two novices won the award for &lsquo;Best Novice&rsquo; at the competition.\r\n\r\nBest Novice awards were given to Se\u00e1n Healy for the men&rsquo;s foil, Fionn O&rsquo;Connor, for the men&rsquo;s sabre and Camille Hindsgaul, for the women&rsquo;s ep\u00e9e.\r\n\r\nThe recent success enjoyed by our novice fencers in both the league and Merseyside Open, in addition to other recent triumphs, is testament to the commitment of our club to maintain and promote a high calibre of fencing. With such a focus on beginner development, coupled with the high quality of coaching, the present is positive, and the future remains bright for DUFC.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Fencing-2-Andrew-Brown-640x536.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24501", "Heading": "Striking Gold"}
