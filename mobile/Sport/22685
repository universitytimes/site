{"Body": "<strong>Cathal Groome |\u00a0</strong>Staff Writer\r\n\r\nThe awarding of &lsquo;Pinks&rsquo; to four recipients was decided at a meeting of the Captains Committee, held on campus last night. The Captains Committee is comprised of all the club captains of DUCAC affiliated clubs, and at the &lsquo;Pinks&rsquo; meeting suggestions are made, lobbied and debated for the appointment of awards. &lsquo;Pinks&rsquo; are awarded to college students in recognition of outstanding performances both at a collegiate and international level in their respective sport. While many students go unaware of the existence of &lsquo;Pinks&rsquo;, they are essentially the Trinity College equivalent of the prestigious, and more familiar, &lsquo;Blues&rsquo; which are awarded by Oxford and Cambridge. As such the level required to receive such an accolade is exceptionally high.\r\n\r\nAt last night&rsquo;s meeting four athletes were rewarded for their endeavours. Sam Mehigan received an award for his participation in Ultimate Frisbee with both Trinity and Ireland. Rebecca Woods, who has stood-out as one of Trinity&rsquo;s best runners during her college career, notably as a member of last year&rsquo;s intervarsity champions, received an award for athletics. Ciar\u00e1n O&rsquo;Neill received the award for his exploits in trampoline, while kayaker Aisling Smith added a &lsquo;Pink&rsquo; to her recent award of a sports scholarship.\r\n\r\n<i>The University Times </i>wishes to extend its congratulations to its newest &lsquo;Pinks&rsquo; and sports scholars.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_22696\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"679\"]<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/pinks.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-22696\" alt=\"This official DUCAC photo release was made earlier today.
