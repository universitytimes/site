There have been a few twists and turns in this tournament, not least Holland&rsquo;s inability to gain a single point. However, true to form, both Spain and Germany have advanced unscathed to this stage, joined by the Italian warhorses and Portuguese thoroughbreds. Each of the four teams is littered with stars of the modern game, and Xavi, Iniesta, Ronaldo, Nani, Ozil, Schweinsteiger, Pirlo and Buffon&rsquo;s respective nations have realistic hopes of an outright victory. In what has been a decent tournament to date, the event would not be complete without some more UT predictions.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Spain v Portugal</strong>\n\nIn the first of the semis, Iberian neighbours Portugal and Spain clash in a game dominated by Real/Barca match-ups. The self-proclaimed one man band that is Cristiano Ronaldo faces Pique and Ramos, while Pepe and Coentrao will be aiming to stifle the six-man Spanish midfield/attack. The crucial question in this fixture centres on Portugal, and Ronaldo in particular; will they offer a potent enough attacking threat to make a game of it? If so then we have all the makings of a classic. If not then expect a game similar to Spain&rsquo;s quarter final with France; comfortable for La Furia Roja and stifling for the neutral viewer.\n\nSpain rarely fail to show up to a big game and in this squad they have vast experience and a winning mentality, stemming both from club and international glories. They are more than capable of passing any side into frustrated oblivion. The Portuguese need to step up and be counted, if Ronaldo and Coentrao can expose Arbeloa like Ribery did on Saturday night, and if Moutinho, Meireles and Veloso can acquire a reasonable percentage of attacking ball, then Portugal could edge it. Unfortunately, in my opinion a Spain-Germany final seems inevitable; therefore I&rsquo;m going for a tight Spanish victory, 1-0 or 2-1.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Italy v Germany</strong>\n\nDue to the prospect of goal-machine Ronaldo facing his superstar Madrid club mates in the first semi-final, Thursday night&rsquo;s clash between Germany and Italy has largely taken a back seat, with many presuming Germany will saunter through the decimated Italian defence. This seems unreasonable, although Chiellini is a notable absence, the centre-back pairing of Bonucci and Barzagli has up to this point proved a capable coalition. One glance at Pirlo&rsquo;s master class against the admittedly limited English, coupled with the hard-working De Rossi and Marchisio, suggests that Italy have the attitude and patience to win the Euros.\n\nThat said, Germany have been sensational so far, brushing through the group of death unscathed, then easily outclassing the Greeks in a metaphor-laden quarter-final. In Mezut Ozil they have a young Pirlo, while countless column inches have been taken up lauding Bayern Munich&rsquo;s German contingent. This game could be much more open than the other semi; Germany&rsquo;s attacking strategy leaves gaps at the back, while we have so far been presented with an Italy team that is far from stereotypical.\n\nFollowing his demolition of Gerrard, Parker and, cough, Henderson, Germany will surely aim to mark Pirlo out of the game, both Schweinsteiger and Khedira have the engines to efficiently carry out this job and still present an attacking threat. Balotelli has so far flattered to deceive but his goal against the hapless Boys in Green showed a glimpse of his talent. This might be the game where he finally wins over a so far unconvinced Italian nation. If he misfires, Italy have an uphill task. Although I&rsquo;m a big fan of this Italian team, Joachim Low&rsquo;s squad seem to have too much talent and too much in the tank; therefore I&rsquo;ll go for a 2-1 German win.", "Imageurl": "11012", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "11011", "Heading": "Euro 2012: Semi-Finals Underway Tonight"}
