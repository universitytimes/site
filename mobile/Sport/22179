{"Body": "<strong>Neil Willoughby |\u00a0</strong>Contributing Writer\r\n\r\nIreland&rsquo;s unconvincing and disappointing performance last weekend has led to many seeing this weekend&rsquo;s clash with the All-Blacks as a formality. New Zealand have yet to lose or draw this calendar year, racking up several impressive victories, most notably throughout their dominant Rugby Championship campaign. This included two solid wins over Ireland&rsquo;s conquerors, Australia.\r\n\r\nThe wave of optimism and expectation that greeted Joe Schmidt&rsquo;s entrance into office is still existent despite a performance which left a lot to be desired. The classic labeling of this Irish teams beginnings is that of a &lsquo;transition&rsquo; period. Schmidt has taken this approach initially, epitomised by D&rsquo;Arcy and Murray both being left out of the starting XV against Australia, with D&rsquo;Arcy missing the cut altogether. However, it seems that conservative nature of his predecessors selections could also become a feature of Schmidt&rsquo;s regime. The release of Luke Marshall back to Ulster this weekend points to this, despite a solid performance last weekend, Schmidt will more than likely select the tried and tested D&rsquo;Arcy at inside-centre. It seems that Schmidt is following the trend of previous Irish national coaches by returning to proven players as soon as their backs are against the wall.\r\n\r\nScrum-half is another position where Schmidt hasn&rsquo;t really ventured much in. It has become a position that Ireland seem to have been lacking in in recent weeks. Murray&rsquo;s Lions form hasn&rsquo;t carried through for Munster, the speed of his passing and arrival at rucks are areas that he needs to take a look at. While Reddan seemed to rectify this off the bench against Samoa, his defensive frailties were all too obvious against Australia, particularly for Nick Cummins&rsquo; try.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_22180\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"642\"]<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Australia-v-Ireland.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-22180\" alt=\"Australia beat Ireland 32-15 last weekend.\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Australia-v-Ireland.jpg\" width=\"642\" height=\"361\" /></a> Australia beat Ireland 32-15 last weekend.[/caption]\r\n\r\nMurray seems the safer pick in the short term based on his defensive capabilities, notably his box-kicks. But, this a position where Ireland need more depth and it is disappointing that Schmidt hasn&rsquo;t looked to give players such as Paul Marshall their chance during this Autumn series. Kieran Marmion is another who deserves his chance at test level. The Connacht rugby player has seen a quick rise to the Connacht starting team since last season and all signs point to him being capped sooner rather than later, considering his Welsh qualifications.\r\n\r\nLooking on from the Australia clash, Ireland need to examine the scrum. The dominance Ireland enjoyed against Samoa was comfortably curbed by an underrated Australian pack. The Aussie pack, although underrated, are not a group that Ireland should have issues dealing with. Both sides of Ireland&rsquo;s scrum didn&rsquo;t perform well at the weekend, with Ross and Healy feeling the effects of their opponents efforts. This has long been an area where Ireland have lacked firepower and consistency. The front-row of Healy, Best, Ross along with the back-row of O&rsquo;Mahony, O&rsquo;Brien, Heaslip are well established units at this stage.\r\n\r\nHowever, the second-row partnership of Toner and O&rsquo;Connell is new, having made their debut as a unit last weekend. O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s return to the Irish starting team was a rusty affair in most ways, save for the usual line-out excellence. Toner too did well in the line-out but, both seemed to struggle when it came to scrum time. Toner has never been renowned for his scrummaging ability, perhaps a weakness which has meant that his rise to the Leinster starting team has taken much longer than expected. Both players left a lot to be desired in the loose, with O&rsquo;Connell throwing bad passes on several occasions and Toner&rsquo;s ball-carrying and rucking were not as dynamic or successful as compared to other locks in the Irish management&rsquo;s long-term plans.\r\n\r\nDan Tuohy has been very unlucky not to appear in any form in recent weeks. The dynamic second-row ticks all the boxes and has been unlucky to have been given so few opportunities in the green jersey to date. It&rsquo;s clear that Plumtree and Schmidt are focussing on developing Toner but, there is a lot to be said for Tuohy&rsquo;s inclusion. The return of Donnacha Ryan from injury in the new year is certain to suppress Tuohy&rsquo;s opportunities to impress for Ireland.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_22181\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"610\"]<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Ireland-New-Zealand.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-22181\" alt=\"Ireland have never beaten New Zealand.\" src=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Ireland-New-Zealand.jpg\" width=\"610\" height=\"400\" /></a> Ireland have never beaten New Zealand.[/caption]\r\n\r\nIreland are also facing several injuries suffered by key players last weekend. Sexton, Kearney and O&rsquo;Driscoll are all doubts, while McFadden has been ruled out as a result of a fractured hand. Kearney looks set to recover in time, having trained fully on Wednesday. Brother, Dave, also looks set to earn his 2nd cap on the left-wing after an impressive brace off the bench against Samoa. The issue of replacing 10 and 13, if both Sexton and O&rsquo;Driscoll are forced out of the game, is a much trickier prospect. Madigan failed to display himself as well as he can against Australia, resorting to aimless kicking to relieve pressure at times. Jackson performance against Samoa was promising but, his kicking from hand wasn&rsquo;t good enough, similar to Madigan. The absence of Sexton will most likely lead to Jackson inclusion at 10, with Madigan taking his place amongst the replacements for a third test in a row. The Irish management seem much more confident that O&rsquo;Driscoll will take the field on Sunday as both Marshall and Cave have been included in the Ulster team who play Edinburgh this weekend. D&rsquo;Arcy looks set to regain the 12 jersey with Henshaw most likely coming in if O&rsquo;Driscoll isn&rsquo;t fit. Changes aren&rsquo;t too likely, save those that are forced through injury but, Schmidt is giving his injured players every chance to face the All Blacks.\r\n\r\nIreland face a stern challenge this weekend against a side who are seeking to taste victory for the 14th time this season. The intimidation factor could be important, with memories of Ireland&rsquo;s 60-0 defeat the last time the two teams met an embarrassing one for the Irish. Ireland have everything to prove and nothing to lose, surely the motivation of O&rsquo;Driscoll&rsquo;s last chance to defeat the All Blacks will provoke a performance.\r\n\r\nConsidering the form of the two sides, even an optimist can&rsquo;t but presume New Zealand will win convincingly this weekend.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/AllBlacks-Ireland.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "22179", "Heading": "Backs to the Wall for All-Blacks Clash"}
