{"Body": "<strong>Twenty-year-old triathlete Hollie Avil is one of Great Britain&rsquo;s shining lights heading into the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games having won the 2009 U23 World Championship Triathlon. She told Sports Editor <em>Jack Leahy</em></strong><strong> why patience is a virtue, what she would be doing if she wasn&rsquo;t training for the Olympics and of the effect that 2012 will have on London.</strong>\n<strong><em>How did you get into triathlon?</em></strong>\n\nIt was my Dad who suggested it! I&rsquo;d been swimming competitively for five years and was looking for a new challenge. I also competed at running for my school, and loved it. All I had to do was add in the bike!\n\n<strong><em>2007 looks to me like it was your big break [victory in the ITU Junior Triathlon World Championships, ETU Junior Triathlon European Championships, Corus Elite Series and British Elite Women&rsquo;s National Sprint Triathlon, and the Cross Country Championships across three age groups] how did you get to such a high standard at the age of only 17?</em></strong>\n\nI&rsquo;ve always said that age is only a number. I just worked extremely hard. It took a lot of dedication, determination and organisation to achieve what I achieved because I was still at school. I also put a lot down to my old coach, Ben Bright, who turned me into a triathlete after being a swimmer for so long.\n\n<strong><em>That said, it just got better and better (French Grand Prix Champion 2008, World U23 Champion, and an impressive number of top 3 finishes)- how on earth do you manage such consistency?</em></strong>\n\nPatience was a key factor believe it or not. As I achieved more, I wanted to do more, but my coach kept the reins on me. Patience really is a virtue. If I did too much too young, I could have broken down. It&rsquo;s all about the long term picture.\n\n<strong><em>Just how much training and how strict a diet do you have to follow to chase your Olympic dream?</em></strong>\n\nI average around 24 hours a week training. It&rsquo;s not the time you put in though, it&rsquo;s what you put into the time. Our diets don&rsquo;t have to be strict as we need a lot of calories! But it&rsquo;s important to make sure we are getting the right nutrients in, so it is a well balanced one. Protein, for example, is so important for recovery and muscle repair!\n\n<strong><em>How do you manage your College schedule along with an Olympic training schedule?</em></strong>\n\nI&rsquo;ve currently deferred my degree in Management Sciences. When I was training full time and studying full time, it took a lot of organisation and forward planning to fit everything in. I managed to do it, but it was extremely stressful. In order to focus fully on 2012, I decided the best thing to do was to put my degree on hold. I also didn&rsquo;t want to end up with a half hearted degree result.\n\n<strong><em>Do you think you can improve greatly in a specific discipline of the event or do you feel well-rounded?</em></strong>\n\nThere&rsquo;s always something I can improve, which makes each training phase exciting.\n\n<strong><em>How intense has your training become in the 18-month run-up to the Olympics?</em></strong>\n\nWhat are the key changes as the event gets closer? I have changed training location and coaches recently. I am now based in Leeds. So my training up to 2012 will be different to what I&rsquo;m used to, which is exciting! That has been the major change, though I&rsquo;m sure I will be tweaking my training over the next 18 months.\n\n<strong><em>Can you tell us a bit more about qualification and the competition you are up against in the other UK athletes and what races you need to complete to get a place in the team of 3?</em></strong>\n\nWe have so many fantastic GB triathletes that the qualification for 2012 will be tough. There were only 2 places available in Beijing but because we have greater strength in depth now, there will be 3 places up for grabs in London. We have a selection policy, with podium performances at Hyde Park WCS and the Beijing WCS Grand Final earning you selection in 2011, allowing you the winter to prepare for London. All I&rsquo;ve got to focus on is training hard and racing the best I can.\n\n<strong><em>What are your personal goals for the Olympics?</em></strong>\n\nThe first goal is to qualify! The ultimate goal is to get on that podium and grab that Gold medal for GB. It&rsquo;s a once in a life time chance to race at a home Olympic Games, so I want to do everything I can to make GB proud.\n\n<strong><em>How do you think the preparations are coming along for the 2012 Games?</em></strong>\n\nIt all looks fantastic so far! It&rsquo;s going to be pretty amazing when it&rsquo;s all finished. This year will be the first year we will race on the proposed Olympic course in Hyde Park, meaning we will cycle down to Buckingham Palace and also run around the Serpentine.\n\n<strong><em>The Olympics are certainly more than just a fortnight of competition, and the organising committee have talked a lot about a &lsquo;legacy&rsquo; - how can this event change London for the long-term? </em></strong>\n\nNot only will it change London, it will change the whole of the UK. I think the Olympics will raise a big awareness around sport, health and well being. It will also open up several opportunities for people wanting to get involved in sport. I think it will make our nation an overall healthier nation.\n\n<strong><em>What would you be doing if you weren&rsquo;t an Olympic-in training?</em></strong>\n\nI think I&rsquo;d still be involved with the Olympics somehow. Perhaps working with some of the school projects and helping children get involved with the Olympic spirit.\n\n<strong><em>Is there anything you feel you miss due to the amount of training etc? </em></strong>\n\nNot one thing.", "Imageurl": "140", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "138", "Heading": "Jack Leahy interviews British triathlete Hollie Avil"}
