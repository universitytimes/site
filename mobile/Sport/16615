{"Body": "Jack Leahy - Sports Editor\n\nIn a survey carried out by UT Sports, Trinity students showed their national pride in predicting that Ireland will win this year&rsquo;s RBS 6 Nations Championship.\n\n38.2% of the 110 students surveyed predicted that Declan Kidney&rsquo;s men would top the table, despite a poor run of form in the recent Autumn Internationals series fixtures against South Africa, Argentina, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\nIn defiance of the anti-French sentiment which exploded onto the Irish sporting scene in Paris in November 2009, 32.7% make Marc Lieveremont&rsquo;s Bleus the most likely challengers, with the Welsh a distant third favourite of Trinity students on 18%. England, Scotland, and Italy round off Trinity&rsquo;s predicted table, with the latter two only polling a single vote each.\n\nWhen asked about Ireland&rsquo;s chances of winning back the Grand Slam, Trinity students reclaimed their place on the metaphorical fence, with 59.3% rating our chances as &lsquo;decent&rsquo;, with an unconvincing 11.1% choosing &lsquo;strong&rsquo; and a melancholic 29.6% opting for &lsquo;non-existent&rsquo;. Come on boys and girls, where is Trinity&rsquo;s well-known nationalistic enthusiasm? Summing up Trinity&rsquo;s lack of confidence in Ireland&rsquo;s Grand Slam hopes, one student commented &lsquo;We have the kind of team who can go on to win the Championship, but we&rsquo;re in the kind of form that suggests that we could be vulnerabe to France and England, even of they do have to come to Dublin&rsquo;.\n\nStaying true to their Leinster heritage, an overwhelming 78.8% of students surveyed declared their preference for Johnny Sexton to wear number 10 ahead of his provincial rival Ronan O&rsquo;Gara. Declan Kidney seems far less decisive on the matter, struggling to\u00a0 choose between the ageing, experienced and once invincible O&rsquo; Gara and Sexton&rsquo;s playmaking prowess which offers less in terms of place-kicking.\n\nIn the poll&rsquo;s final question, 60% of the 100 students who answered would back a fit-again Tom\u00e1s O&rsquo; Leary to regain his number 9 shirt for the series, with the remaining 40% bidding Peter Stringer to cotinue a remarkable return from the international scrap-heap. Stringer has played second-fiddle to \u00d3 Leary when both are fit, but the Autumn Internationals showed that &lsquo;Strings&rsquo; will never be far from the hearts and minds of Irish rugby.", "Imageurl": "Jack Leahy - Sports Editor\n\nIn a survey carried out by UT Sports, Trinity students showed their national pride in predicting that Ireland will win this year&rsquo;s RBS 6 Nations Championship.\n\n38.2% of the 110 students surveyed predicted that Declan Kidney&rsquo;s men would top the table, despite a poor run of form in the recent Autumn Internationals series fixtures against South Africa, Argentina, New Zealand, and South Africa.\n\nIn defiance of the anti-French sentiment which exploded onto the Irish sporting scene in Paris in November 2009, 32.7% make Marc Lieveremont&rsquo;s Bleus the most likely challengers, with the Welsh a distant third favourite of Trinity students on 18%.
