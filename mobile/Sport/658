{"Body": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Trinity College Ladies Gaelic Football Club created a piece of history in Clanna Gael Fontenoy last Wednesday 27th Jan by claiming the Quill Cup, which is the first time the lady gaelic footballers of Ireland&rsquo;s oldest university have claimed an all-ireland league title.
