The introduction of a loan scheme had been explored by Minister Quinn's predecessor, Batt O'Keefe, but Minister Quinn is adamant that such a scheme would not deliver the financial relief that the third level system needs now.\n\n\"A system that will only become self-financing over 17 years does not help\u00a0Michael Noonan\u00a0or\u00a0Brendan Howlin\u00a0in today's place,\" said the Minister. In his report earlier this year, Dr Colin Hunt \u00a0said that the third level sector will need an extra &euro;500 per year to maintain current standards. However, he also envisioned this funding goal being achieved through a mixture of an income contingent loan scheme and increased upfront fees. Since Minister Quinn has now ruled out the former, it seems likely that the latter will be more onerous than previously expected.\n\nMinister Quinn said that a loan scheme seemed like a good idea but that statistics showed that it does not work in practice. Citing the fact that 25% of Australian students default on their loans, Minister Quinn suggested that a loan scheme was merely an incentive to emigrate.\n\nUSI President Gary Redmond said, \"Our major concern is the fact that Minister Quinn has signalled that he'll increase the student contribution. Before the election he signed a pledge saying that he wouldn't do this and less than six months into the election he's going back on this. I think it's a little bit cynical that this statement has been made the day before the Leaving Cert results come out when parents are worried about whether their children are going to get into college.\"\n\n&nbsp;", "Imageurl": "3578", "Thumb_nail": "http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Ruairi-Quinn", "ID": "3577", "Heading": "Quinn rules out loan scheme, signals an increase in upfront fees"}
