{"Body": "Miley Cyrus &ndash; <em>Wrecking Ball</em> (Kaelin Ellis Remix)\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/_7DvCX93XcU\r\nAlthough Billy Ray Cyrus may be ashamed of absolutely everything\r\nhis daughter has put her name to, he can rest easy knowing that\r\nsomething good can come from her atrocities. In this case,\r\n16-year-old Floridian producer, Kaelin Ellis, has saved the day with a\r\ndazzling hip-hop version of Wrecking Ball.\r\n\r\nRedinho &ndash; <em>Searching</em>\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/SKh9BedNVR8\r\n\r\nOne of the standout tracks of Summer 2013, we&rsquo;re trying to entice\r\nthe sun back with Redinho&rsquo;s feel-good hit. Redinho will also be\r\nplaying live this Thursday at Junior Spesh as part of the Beatyard\r\nFestival. Known for his ridiculous use of equipment and all-out funky\r\nlive performances, this is one not to be missed.\r\n\r\nDeBarge &ndash; <em>I Like It</em>\r\n\r\nhttp://youtu.be/VqaKisKIyUo\r\n\r\nA fantastic track released in 1982 by brothers Randy, Bunny and El\r\nDeBarge. The second single from the album All This Love, this song\r\nwas the first big success for the group. While it has been covered\r\nand sampled hundreds of times over the past 30 years, nothing can\r\nquite beat the original.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IMG_2304.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "21093", "Heading": "What We're Listening To: 3"}
