Their captain Cian Culleton, played with a injured wrist and together with Paul Ryan and Des Dillon battled hard.\n\nRock grabbed a\u00a0 try of their own with Scott-Lennon diving over in the corner and Godfrey adding the touchline conversion to make it 29-11. \u00a0However it was to be Rocks' last say on the game, as both teams, clearly tiring from the first game of the league began to make errors. \u00a0Aside from the energizer bunny DuToit who looked as if he could have played another 160 minutes afterwards, the final whistle came as welcome relief.\n\nAn old expression from the days of school rugby is you can&rsquo;t knock the Rock. \u00a0You can&rsquo;t, but you can beat them. \u00a0And Trinity did just that. \u00a0The game was far from perfect, and Trinity will need to improve aspects of their rucking and their scrummaging for the tougher tests this year. \u00a0It&rsquo;s not by any means an ideal start for Blackrock and the Stradbrook boys could be in for a tough year as theu look to be lacking the necessary for this level.\n\nDUFC will have to be content with a bonus point win that leaves them third in the table. \u00a0It is however a long season and eyes would have been cast at UCD&rsquo;s huge win up in Belfast where they demolished Belfast Harlequins 48-20.\n\nAs Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said &lsquo;Great is the art of beginning, but greater is the art of ending&rsquo;.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>DUFC\u00a0\u00a0</strong>\n\nTries: Robles, Dilger, Dargan, Kelly\nPen: Joyce\nConv: Joyce (3)\n\n<strong>Rock\u00a0</strong>\n\nTries: Lennon\nPen: Godfrey\nConv: Godfrey", "Imageurl": "12511", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "12508", "Heading": "DUFC Cruise Past Blackrock in UBL Season Opener "}
