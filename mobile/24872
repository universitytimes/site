{"Body": "<p>Laura Harmon won TCDSU&rsquo;s nomination for the position of President in the upcoming USI elections at the Council hustings yesterday evening. The other candidates that were nominated by TCDSU were Saoirse Nic A&rsquo;Bhaird (for the position of Vice-President for Welfare), Gavin Lynch-Frahill (for the position of Vice-President of Academic Affairs and Quality Assurance), Glenn Fitzpatrick (for the position of Vice-President for Campaigns) and Feidhlim Seoighe (for the position of Irish Language Vice-President). The last three positions were uncontested as the other candidates were not present at hustings.</p>\n<p>Laura Harmon&rsquo;s speech focused on the issues relating to Trinity students. She cited mental health, the maintenance grant and LGBT rights as being some of the key issues that she will be focusing on if elected. Recalling Trinity&rsquo;s poor turnout at recent USI rallies, Harmon stressed that this was the fault of USI, who &lsquo;failed to engage TCD students&rsquo; &ndash; she believes that she is the candidate who can change this. Harmon also commended TCD for being &lsquo;at the forefront of social change&rsquo;, and a &lsquo;pioneer of LGBT rights&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>The USI candidates were invited to speak following a motion passed by SU Council on the 10<sup>th</sup> December mandating &ldquo;the sabbatical officers to invite candidates for the relevant USI Officer Board positions to attend hustings at the second-to-last Council of the academic year&rdquo;. \u00a0\u00a0USI acts as a national representative for all students, and in order to run for the positions within the organization candidates need to be nominated by two students&rsquo; unions. During the election, TCDSU will vote on six positions in the USI, and the outcome of the hustings determined which candidates TCDSU will vote for.</p>\n", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/lauraharmon.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "24872", "Heading": "Laura Harmon wins TCDSU nomination at USI hustings"}
