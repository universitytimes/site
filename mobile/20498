{"Body": "<strong>Vladimir Rakhmanin</strong> | Deputy Editor\r\n\r\nThe members of Youth Lockout, a new student movement, gathered today for their first official meeting. Led by Dylan Joyce-Ahearne, the members joined in a room in the Arts Block to discuss potential strategies for the following year. The movement is not affiliated with the Trinity College Students' Union (TCDSU) or the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), and is not affiliated with any political party.\r\n\r\nJoyce-Ahearne began the meeting by explaining that students are targeted by the government because they are not organised and do not vote. He noted that while the USI was successful in protecting the cuts to the maintenance grant - and that this was to be commended - the result was still &lsquo;not good enough&rsquo;. He stressed that the student movement in Ireland was virtually &lsquo;non-existent&rsquo;, citing the poor turnout at the recent USI demonstration.\r\n\r\nJoyce-Ahearne also discussed some of the issues he hoped to tackle with this movement, such as youth emigration, grants cuts, fee hikes, and graduate unemployment.\r\n\r\nJoyce-Ahearne mentioned that the movement should take a two-pronged approach &ndash; Youth Lockout is to tackle issues on both a college-wide level and a national level, through lobbying and direct action.\r\n\r\nA point was raised on student apathy &ndash; it was stated that students were not necessarily apathetic, but rather ignorant of political events. Therefore, mobilisation and promotion were deemed to be key issues.\r\n\r\nJoyce-Ahearne further stated that despite the fact that the grant was not cut, the struggle was far from over &ndash; particularly due to the fact that the Provost of Trinity College is calling for full fees to be put in place. He expressed a desire for the movement to have a &lsquo;direct, tangible grasp&rsquo; on student issues.\r\n\r\nYouth Lockout will be holding another public meeting to discuss the developments of the movement and will also be attending the \"We're Not Leaving!\" assembly in Liberty Hall on the 9th of November.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/youthlockout.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20498", "Heading": "Youth Lockout Student Movement Holds First Public Meeting "}
