My problem is that the girl of my dreams (and other less savour imaginings) is going to the same Halloween party as me and I just cannot work out how to pitch my costume. It&rsquo;s got to be scary but not creepy, funny but flattering and above all it can&rsquo;t break the bank.\u00a0</strong>\n<strong>Clearly the bog-roll mummy (Egyptian, not maternal) I&rsquo;ve used as my go-to for years isn&rsquo;t going to carve the pumpkin; but what else is there?</strong>\n<strong>A speedy reply would be much appreciated.</strong>\n<strong>Yours,</strong>\n<strong>P</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Dearest P,</em>\n<em>First off I have to say, and this really is true, that of all the emails I have received in the ten minutes I&rsquo;ve been doing this column yours is one of, if not the, most troubling yet. I mean, who wouldn&rsquo;t sympathise with your situation? You&rsquo;ve got a party to go, probably the biggest of your life, and you&rsquo;ve got to wear fancy dress. There&rsquo;s only two ways it can go: get it right and you&rsquo;ll be sinking your teeth into a night of red hot passion; get it wrong and your dusty old broomstick goes un-ridden for another night.</em>\n<em>And so to my solution...</em>\n<em>At first, I must admit that I toyed with all sorts of elaborate costumes to fulfil you criteria: a spooky and ghoulish character from a gothic novel (e.g. Frankenstein)? A cruel and notorious serial killer of years gone-by (e.g. Jack The Ripper)? An evil and grotesque witch (e.g Kerry Katona)?</em>\n<em>But then I visited your Facebook and realised the answer to our problems lay in something far simpler &ndash; do nothing. Indeed, with your heavily misshaped face, lank hair and repulsive fashion sense it seems that no &lsquo;dressing-up&rsquo; is needed &ndash; you are, all at once, scary, creepy and hilarious to look at and this way you needn&rsquo;t spend a penny!</em>\n<em>Now get out of my office.</em>\n<em>Uncle Jamie</em>\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Dear Uncle Jamie,</strong>\n<strong>I&rsquo;m told that you are a relationship guru so I&rsquo;m really hoping you can help me. Essentially, my problem is that my boyfriend constantly picks his nose and it&rsquo;s really getting to me. We&rsquo;ve been going out for nearly two years and everything was fine until a friend pointed-out that my bf always has his finger buried in his nose and it&rsquo;s getting worse. In the past, for example, his nasal excavations were confined to quiet and subtle moments; but recently he&rsquo;s been doing it during lectures and during conversations. He&rsquo;s even at it when we&rsquo;re <em>at</em> <em>it,</em> if you see what I mean.</strong>\n<strong>I have tried asking politely but nothing seems to change and now I really think it might be the end of us.</strong>\n<strong>Please help me salvage my relationship.</strong>\n<strong>Thanks so much,</strong>\n<strong>E</strong>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>E,</em>\n<em>This is indeed a difficult situation and one that requires a sensitive and sensible response. Unfortunately I can offer you neither of the above and instead suggest that either you dump him or lump him. For his sake at least I would consider the former. After all, what self-respecting man would want a relationship where he can&rsquo;t perform the pick and flick manoeuvre at least twice per day?</em>\n<em>Women the world over need to understand that, despite what others may say, you cannot change a man &ndash; once a picker, always a picker.</em>\n<em>Kindest regards,</em>\n<em>Uncle Jamie</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you need help with a serious problem or are seeking advice on a sensitive issues then get in touch with \u00a0your GP.
