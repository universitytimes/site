{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Leanna Byrne</strong> | Editor</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Department of Social Protection has defended the company that have advertised on the JobBridge site looking for candidates with a &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; of a PhD.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following a request for comment on the ClaroChem Ireland Ltd. advertisement from <em>The University Times</em>, a spokesperson from the Department said that &ldquo;the qualifications required by a host organisation are a matter for the organisation, which will know best the nature of the position that they are offering&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The spokesperson also went on to say that JobBridge is a voluntary scheme and that &ldquo;interns choose the host organisation they wish to work for&rdquo;. Furthermore, the department believes that highly skilled internships can offer an essential bridge of real-workplace experience to those with relevant qualifications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When asked whether or not the skill set gained from completing a PhD is of greater value than a JobBridge internship the spokesperson responded:</p>\r\n&ldquo;JobBridge gives opportunities to jobseekers across the spectrum of qualifications. \u00a0In the recent independent evaluation of JobBridge, it was found that 35.9% of interns hold qualifications below primary degree level, with 22.4% of interns having a postgraduate qualification. Given the high numbers of interns holding graduate and post-graduate qualifications, it is necessary that JobBridge offers them an internship that meets their needs.&rdquo;\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Clarochem Ireland Ltd is an APIs manufacturing plant, located in Damastown. The company say they are looking for an intern that will work as a Process Chemist. This intern will gain &ldquo;practical experience in development and scale-up of chemical processes and their introduction to the manufacturing plant, gathering and reviewing relevant information/documentation&rdquo;.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Although the internship is trying to attract a candidate with a &ldquo;minimum PhD in Synthetic Chemistry&rdquo;, the advertisement also states that there is &ldquo;no experience required&rdquo;. The applicant must only be &ldquo;keen to develop their industrial experience in a busy pharmaceutical/chemical manufacturing plant. Furthermore, the intern is expected to work for 39 hours per week for a period of six months with an allowance of &euro;50 per week in addition to the current Social Welfare payment.</p>\r\nClaroChem have not responded to <em>The University Times'</em> request for a comment.", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/grants.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "23068", "Heading": "Department of Social Protection Defends Company Seeking PhD Qualifications"}
