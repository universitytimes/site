Your favourite high street brands have all but relegated the winter neutrals and woollens to the fashion mausoleum (or a sale outlet, if you will) and the busy fashion worker bees are bumbling around shop floors, toiling away, fastidious and eager, to unveil the new spring delights that are long over-due. With the murkiness of winter long behind us, only mere remnants of autumn/winter collections are left as a reminder. Nonetheless, it is clear; spring has arrived in all its jubilant, vibrant splendour.\n\nI think I&rsquo;m pretty much ready to face the high street and start amassing a springtime collection of new threads. Honestly, I can barely contain my excitement; this is, undoubtedly set to be a knock-out season of drop-dead-gorgeous looks, where both fashion and beauty are concerned. This is one of my favourite times of year. Dublin transforms from an arctic, ice-coated, dismal death-trap to being home to song birds and flora once more. Not only that but we can all breathe a sigh of relief (or despair, depending on how you feel about such issues) as we can get our pins out again, moisturised and tanned, ready to strut our stuff around the Arts block (or respectively, which ever block you may belong to).\n\nHowever, one must take heed and approach this season with caution. Let us not confuse trend with fad. A good wardrobe, regardless of what style you may prefer, should have longevity. No matter how eclectic your attitude to your own personal style may be, setting out to have a coherent wardrobe is always a good idea. Otherwise, it is just money down the drain and unworn clothes in an Oxfam donation bin. Be a trend savant, not a fashion victim. Unlike autumn/winter, where the colours are more neutral and the looks generally more basic, spring can be a treacherous season for picking up items that are, dare I say it, too out there.\n\nThis season presents us with colourful, bold options. 1970&rsquo;s is presently a primary concept on the fashion radar. To make it work, choosing denim pieces is a good strategy; high-waisted shorts ( a-la Topshop) could be the focal point of a great seventies inspired look, teamed with a floral blouse or a front-tie shirt and voila! Seventies chic without breaking the bank and will carry you through right into the next season.\n\nAlternatively to super lurid colour and retro shapes, you can opt for all white - dresses, blazers, tops, skirts. Above all, white is this seasons shade; super classy, ultra radiant, a little innocent. My suggestion? Opt for the blazer, as it is versatile enough to last through the summer months and early autumn. Wear with skinny jeans and skyscraper heels for the ultimate glamour appeal.\n\nSpring is all about letting go of the dark, the cold and jumping into fresh, new styles, experimenting with patterns and colours. Following trends is fabulous, but often results in a mainstream look that signifies nothing more than adhering to the norm. To really hit the right note, team up the old with the new and incorporate them together. Make use of previous purchases from the winter months, not only to save money, but also to resurrect former favourites to their rightful glory. My philosophy is, enjoy fashion, enjoy the art of it, but just like any other purchase, proceed with caution. I for one shall be keeping a firm hand on my purse strings this season. And do not forget; if it seems too trendy do not buy it! Opting for the in-thing doesn&rsquo;t necessarily work, as each and every one has their own stamp to put on their look; embrace your fashion autonomy and feed your inner glamazon.\n\n<em> </em>\n<em>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_1915\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"346\" caption=\"Model: Emma Hughes\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Kneeling-on-grass.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1915   \" title=\"Kneeling on grass\" src=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Kneeling-on-grass.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"346\" height=\"461\" /></a>[/caption]\n\nThis week&rsquo;s fabulous three-some is. . .\n\n</em>\n<em>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Topshop fashion week Minny Mouse hair.</em>\n<em>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yeah Yeah Yeah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Show Your Bones&rdquo; album on replay.</em>\n<em>-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 M.A.C. lipstick in Snob.</em>\n<em> </em>\n<em>They just work so well together :)</em>", "Imageurl": "1919", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "1913", "Heading": "Time to Shop: Spring 2011"}
