At the same time, I can&rsquo;t think of anything more irritating than the radio ads for Concern Gifts that are seemingly just impossible to avoid. The whole concept just gets to me.\n\nIf you&rsquo;re one of the few fortunate people that hasn&rsquo;t been subjected to these evil advertisements, let me explain. The idea behind Concern Gifts is that a person wishing to buy a present for their lucky child, parent, family member, friend or mistress, gets them a card. Written\n\ninside is a message which goes something like this. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re never going to guess what you&rsquo;re getting this Christmas! A goat! Isn&rsquo;t that what you always wanted? Doesn&rsquo;t that fill you with joy? A goat! I know it has some drawbacks. Its milk tastes shite and it&rsquo;s not really up for having the craic, but still, IT&rsquo;S A MOTHAFUCKIN&rsquo; GOAT! Oh wait, one thing. The goat isn&rsquo;t actually for you. The goat is for a family on the other side of the world. You don&rsquo;t know them and you&rsquo;ll never meet them. But hey, I feel good now for getting them a goat, doing my bit of charity, and giving you this rubbish card that isn&rsquo;t really a Christmas card at all. Happy Christmas!&rdquo;\n\nJaysus. Who wants that, like?\n\nSo with that in mind, picture the scene. It&rsquo;s Christmas morning. I run eagerly downstairs, anticipating a mountain of presents, ready to indulge myself like I have every Christmas of my life. So what if I&rsquo;m spoilt? So what if it&rsquo;s extravagant? It is Christmas, after all.\n\nSo perhaps you can understand my initial disappointment at seeing a solitary envelope under the tree. But all is not lost. Sometimes cash is the best present of all. Open the envelope. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your lucky day.\n\nOh wait, it&rsquo;s someone else&rsquo;s lucky day. They&rsquo;ve got a water pump.\n\nYou&rsquo;ve got fuck all. Happy Christmas, you muppet.&rdquo;\n\nWhat a disgusting thing to do to someone. Being charitable is one thing. If you&rsquo;re one of these bleeding-hearted, smug, simpering, vainglorious, lefty prats with a martyr complex, if you think that it&rsquo;s up to you to solve the world&rsquo;s problems one stupid goat at a time, well that&rsquo;s just your problem. But don&rsquo;t impose your stupidity\n\non me. If you&rsquo;re getting me a present, get me a present. Don&rsquo;t exploit me in order to massage your own ego. If I want to have a self-indulgent, materialistic, fat Christmas, well I&rsquo;m perfectly entitled to do just that. And if you want to piss away all your money on goats, water pumps or worse, pineapple plants, then go right ahead.\n\nBut don&rsquo;t impose your charity on me. The world is plagued with these altruism Nazis. They&rsquo;re everywhere. But damned if they&rsquo;re gonna wreck my Christmas ever again.\n\n&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a world outside your window, and it&rsquo;s a world of dread and fear.&rdquo; Well, thanks for pointing that out, but if I choose to ignore it, that&rsquo;s my decision. It&rsquo;s cold outside.", "Imageurl": "<!-- p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 10.0px; font: 9.0px 'Utopia Std'} span.s1 {letter-spacing: -0.1px} -->By Diarmaid Murphy\n\nThere are many annoying things about Christmas.
