This policy has been reaffirmed by votes at USI Congress on a number of occasions, most recently in 2009.\n\nUSI say that the decision to revise the fees policy came as a result of the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to increase the student contribution charge to &euro;3,000 by 2015.\n\nUSI Congress happens once a year and all major policy decisions are made at it. Elections for USI&rsquo;s officer board are also held at Congress.\n\nTrinity sends 18 delegates to this conference, correlating to the number of students in the college, who are elected by SU council. These delegates will be asked to vote on behalf of Trinity Students as to what USI&rsquo;s position on fees should be.\n\nTraditionally, the other constituent organisations in USI take a more liberal stance on the fee issue than Trinity. If this bears itself out again and Trinity students opt for a more moderate funding option, then Trinity&rsquo;s preferred option may not be the one that becomes policy.\n\nSU President Ryan Bartlett said that the preferendum was an opportunity for students to have their voice heard on a hugely important issue on which there hasn&rsquo;t been a general vote in years.\n\n<a href=\"http://issuu.com/tcdsu/docs/fees_preferendum_booklet\" target=\"_blank\">For more information on the options, click here</a>\u00a0for the SU's information booklet on the preferendum.\n\n<em>Voting will take place in the Arts Block and Hamilton today until 8pm and Thursday 1pm-4pm. </em>\n<em>Also on Thursday lunchtime from 1pm in D&rsquo;Oiler Street.</em>", "Imageurl": "9771", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "9770", "Heading": "Fees preferendum to be decided this week"}
