When an MRI scan reveals that the protagonist has no physical symptoms of a neurological disease, he is then referred to a psychiatrist, who delivers a diagnosis of anxiety disorder. Just as this condition is central to many of the characters storylines told over all six series of the show, so is it central to a great number of real peoples&rsquo; lives.\nThe stress of college life can be a trigger point for many students, in addition to a plethora of other possible causes. It would be impossible to list all the different things that can set off an attack, and they mostly differ from person to person. The symptoms however, are far more noticeable. A racing heart, feeling weak and dizzy, chest pains, hyperventilation, and even in some instances a feeling of imminent death are common. Anxiety disorder can afflict people to such an extent that they avoid situations that might trigger an attack, and in extreme cases shun public life altogether. It may sound obvious, but is important for those suffering from such a condition to seek help, and, if you&rsquo;ll forgive the clich\u00e9, &ldquo;talk to someone about it&rdquo;.\nWhen I was 15, I felt a sensation unnervingly close to what Tony Soprano described as akin to having &ldquo;ginger ale in his skull&rdquo;. Public speaking was always something of a difficulty when I was younger. I&rsquo;ve never stuttered, but any attempt to stand up and speak in front of a large number of people always nearly always resulted in noticeable hyperventilation, extreme sweating, and an embarrassingly shaky voice. In instances where I&rsquo;d have to get up in front of a class to give a presentation, this culminated in panic of the very worst kind. The absolute horror of being put in the spotlight, of having all eyes on me at once, brought out the very worst in me. One day at school, I had to perform such a task, having been asked to read out an essay I had written for homework. I can only describe what ensued as feeling like a slow, painful, and terrifying death. A sea of sweat engulfed me within seconds of standing up at the front of the room, and from the moment I opened my mouth I felt my chest seize up and tighten as though I was having a seizure. By the time I returned to sit down, it felt as though a bomb had been dropped. I felt as though I had subjected the whole room to what must have been one of the most cringeworthy moments of their entire lives, and I myself was sat at my desk, gently shaking and soaked from head to toe. Only the nervousness I had been feeling beforehand led me to understand that I was not, in fact, having a coronary bypass.\n\nFormer lead guitarist for Oasis, Noel Gallagher is one of the most famous celebrities to open up about his history with the condition, after the rock n&rsquo; roll lifestyle began to take its toll on his health: &ldquo;I would wake up at four or five in the morning having these wild, wild panic attacks. Anxiety attacks. Sweating. On the verge of tears. Constant racing heartbeat. Cold sweats then hot sweats. Couldn't sleep. Getting the shakes.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not just celebrities and fictional mafia dons who fall victim to this disorder. Stress is often a major factor in the onset of panic attacks, and needless to say is also a major factor in the lives of students who find that the effort to complete a University degree can be overwhelming. Cognitive behavioural therapy and in suitable cases medication can help to overcome these attacks, but the importance of seeking help cannot be emphasised strongly enough. Denial is no place to make a home. In one episode of The Sopranos, Tony&rsquo;s psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi attempts to empathise with him over his condition, remarking, &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re going through must be painful&rdquo;. The mob boss snaps back, &ldquo;This isn't painful. Getting shot is painful. Getting stabbed in the ribs is painful. This sh*t isn't painful. It's empty... dead.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "13260", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "13259", "Heading": "Ginger Ale in the Skull"}
