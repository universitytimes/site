In addition, there has been no online presence through social media channels or otherwise.</p>\r\nAccording to sources close to the campaign, the NO side will not be beginning their campaign until after the Bank Holiday Weekend. There have been no materials for the NO side ordered yet, however there have been suggestions that armbands will be ordered instead of t-shirts.\r\n\r\nDespite this, the campaign manager for the NO side, James Ringland, is positive about the campaign and believes that they can &ldquo;achieve the right result in letting Tom get on with the work he has done so far and the hard work he is prepared to do this year&rdquo;.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Ringland has received positive feedback from students and said that students &ldquo;recognise the work he&rsquo;s done and they do not want to stop the progress the union is making&rdquo;.\r\n\r\n<blockquote style=\"width: 40%; float: right; margin: 0 0 0 24px;\">Voting will take place on campus 10am &ndash; 8pm Thursday October 31 and Friday November 1</blockquote>\r\nDuring the the period of the referendum Lenihan will be stepping down as President of TCDSU and taking annual leave.\r\n\r\nCampaigning will continue until Friday November 1.
