That&rsquo;s a pretty good place to start. In this, one of the more intriguing Super Bowls in years, there is a strong belief that this trend won&rsquo;t be upset.\n\nAfter nearly twenty years without a grand final appearance, the Red and Gold Army are making their way back to the top in interesting circumstances. Leading the troops is head coach Jim Harbaugh. From the outset, this is staged to be a fantastic game, as Coach Harbaugh will be meeting his older brother, John, in opposition. The Baltimore Ravens are a formidable outfit, there is no denying that, and Ray Lewis&rsquo; &lsquo;Team of Destiny&rsquo; will certainly give the Californians a good run, but at the end of it all, it would be false to think that the Niners would do anything other than defeat their east coast rivals.\n\nThe 49ers have had a spellbinding season. A regular season record of 11-4-1 says a lot in the sense of descriptive statistics. While this bottom line makes for clear reading, an in depth analysis reveals strength throughout the squad, and outstanding players in key positions. Consider first the resurgence of Frank Gore. The all-time leader in rush yardage for the 49ers, he slumped in the late 00&rsquo;s, before resurfacing as one of the league&rsquo;s leading power backs, who bursts past immovable objects and makes remarkable, hard yards. In short, he is a beastly running back in great form, and his work-horse attitude will be vital to beating a forceful Ravens defence.\n\nMuch has been made about the Ravens defence, and very little about the respective 49ers unit. The fact is that San Francisco had the 3<sup>rd</sup> best defence in this year&rsquo;s regular season in terms of yards conceded per game, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> best in points per game. With leaders like Patrick Willis, NaVorro Bowman and Donte Whitner, this squad has nothing short of a monstrous defensive element. That goes without mentioning Aldon Smith, who tallied 19.5 sacks in the regular season and forced three fumbles. This complement of hard-hitting players are more than capable of halting Baltimore&rsquo;s Ray Rice, and certainly have the ability to stymie Joe Flacco&rsquo;s aerial game.\n\nBack on the offensive side of the ball, the Niners possess unmatched depth in their receivers. Tight-end Vernon Davis embodies a will-to-win spirit and a warrior attitude, while Michael Crabtree and Mario Manningham provide a more finessed approach to modern receiving. Similarly, there is no doubting the credentials of the legendary Randy Moss. Moss has made a career catching the impossible ball, and making it look easy. He is a born talent, an experienced sportsman and a proven winner. When push comes to shove, he is the archetypal game-changing receiver, something San Fran haven&rsquo;t truly had since they parted company with Jerry Rice.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest key to a 49ers victory isn&rsquo;t the weapons they possess, but rather the man at the rifle&rsquo;s helm. There is an eternal discussion about the role of the modern quarterback. This season, Colin Kaepernick has taken the discussion to a new level. A true athlete, a baseball prot\u00e9g\u00e9 with a powerful and accurate arm, a speedster outside of the pocket; the list of truisms is justifiably long. Love him or hate him, &ldquo;The Kaeped Krusader&rdquo; has been a revolution since he began starting for his team in the middle of thisseason. After some solid, but occasionally poor performances from long suffering QB Alex Smith, Kaepernick stepped into the breach and inspired with his range and diversity of attack. His regular season performances were fantastic, but undoubtedly the feather in his cap was the 28-24 win in the NFC Championship. Kaepernick showed the prowess and wealth of experience to overcome a 17-0 deficit and an impressive Atlanta Falcons team and take the Niners back to the promised land.\n\nIn some ways it&rsquo;s a simple equation. Five visits to the Super Bowl, five wins. A storied franchise with a legacy of greatness. As is the nature of sport, form is a temporary being and legends are made to be broken. For now though, the time for the San Francisco 49ers to reclaim the throne of American football is at hand. Better offence. Arguably better defence. A mesmerising quarterback in Kaepernick. A determined head coach and a spirited team. \u00a0Tonight, the Niners will inform Ray Lewis that this is no country for old men, while they sail into Byzantium, and once more into the history books.", "Imageurl": "14655", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "14654", "Heading": "A Case for San Francisco"}
