Here, along with the committee, I served the needs of Halls&rsquo; 1000 students, helping fellow committee members to plan, organise and budget their own projects, events and initiatives. This role had its challenges, especially when it came to seeing ideas through - as any project in college can face bureaucratic and administrative difficulties. Despite this I remained committed to finding solutions that would help me fulfil my manifesto targets and was able to implement new services in Halls enhancing the student experience.\n\nI am proud to see that fresher residents this year have recognised and used these services to the full. One example is the re-vamped discount card, a project continued on from my predecessor &ndash; as I have already stated, the President should not only implement new ideas but continue and improve upon the work of previous presidents. I believe student deals are one of the most used and appreciated services of the SU, I have the experience to co-ordinate the SU with local businesses to provide the best deals for students, something I think needs to be maintained on a regular basis giving the significant current economic climate facing students.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_14813\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/02/07/why-i-should-be-su-president-rosa-langhammer/rosa/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-14813\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-14813\" title=\"rosa\" src=\"http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rosa3-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a> Langhammer at Tuesday's Dining Hall hustings.

Serving on a number of societies has broadened both my experience and perspective of the college community, enabling me to understand the vast extent of student needs, difficulties and aspirations. I have particularly enjoyed my roles on the Cancer Society and Enactus they have opened my eyes to the power of ideas to make a difference. Enactus (formally called Students in Free Enterprise) is an entrepreneurial society with a difference, as it supports student run projects, which serve the community. There are so many creative ideas out there, that not only need to be listened to but acted upon. That is why I want to open up House 6 to all &ndash; so the SU initiates the ideas of the very students it serves.\n\nMy extensive experience as a treasurer has enhanced my organisational skills, practicality and rationality. At the end of the day achievements can only be made with the right backing, management and funds. As President of the Student&rsquo;s Union you are also the Co-Treasurer and manage the Student&rsquo;s Union finances in order to see that students get the best value for money. One of the challenges that will lie ahead as Co-Treasurer of the Union is the trade-off in budgeting between various sectors including, Welfare, Campaigns, Services, Ents, Education and Communications and this is the challenge at which I will most revel in having had experience in this trade off as the Treasurer of the Trinity Hall JCR.\n\nMy manifesto is based on feasibility, producing services that are not just achievable but key to improving every Trinity student&rsquo;s college experience. Projects such as an SU Loyalty Card or App are viable, attainable and most importantly will make a difference big or small. My policy aims are simple, to save students money, to improve the efficiency and communication of SU and House 6, and to recognise the wider college community that extends past the walls of main campus.\nIf elected President, I would become the Campaign&rsquo;s Officer of the SU, giving Trinity students a voice nationally and at USI council. The national campaigns at present include the inefficiency of the SUSI grant, the 3% threshold cut to the grant and the nurse&rsquo;s graduate pay being slashed to 80% of it&rsquo;s previous level. As well as campaigning on these along with other 3rd level institutions, I will be pro-active to act quickly on any new issues should they arise and find the most effective way to get Trinity Students behind any minorities affected.\n\nThere are a lot of skills, attributes and qualities that are deemed vital to being a leader. You need to have a strong presence, be able to organise, delegate and motivate, and your policies of course need to be equally as strong &ndash; but all of this is made irrelevant unless you are approachable. I believe I am a leader, but I am also a listener who will take on the ideas of others and, effectively see them implemented to better college life for all. Not only should the President be approachable, but the SU itself &ndash;this is one of my overall campaign aims, to open up the SU as a service to the everyday student.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Read Lylas Aljohmani's article<strong><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/02/07/why-i-should-be-su-president-lylas-aljohmani/\"> here</a>.\u00a0</strong></em>\n<em>Read Tom Lenihan's \u00a0article <strong><a href=\"http://www.universitytimes.ie/2013/02/07/why-i-should-be-su-president-tom-lenihan/\">here.</a></strong></em>", "Imageurl": "14813", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CoverPhoto45", "ID": "14812", "Heading": "Why I Should Be SU President - Rosa Langhammer"}
