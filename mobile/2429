{"Body": "Ciaran Nolan\n\nThe GMB was host to four of the five remaining candidates in the race to become Provost of Trinity last week, as RT\u00c9&rsquo;s Brian Dobson chaired a debate which was co-hosted by The University Times. Students were allowed to submit questions to be asked of the candidates online prior to the debate, and this facility allowed for a lively debate and discussion amongst the candidates about some of the many important issues affecting students.\n\nThe candidates in attendance were Jane Ohlmeyer, Patrick Prendergast and Colm Kearney, all working in Trinity, and Des Fitzgerald of UCD. John Boland was not present at the debate. Each of the candidates talked about the experience they had dealing with senior government officials and politicians, particularly in light of expected cutbacks and the introduction of third level fees.\n\nPrendergast was the only candidate to go so far as to say that he favours the re&ndash;introduction of some sort of student fee, saying that a contribution would go a long way to ensure the long-term security of College finances. &ldquo;For example, if students gave &euro;1000 yearly, this would total to over &euro;11 million for college,&rdquo; explained Prendergast. &ldquo;I also think we could target our alumni for some more funding.&rdquo;\n\nThe issue of philanthropy was the focus of some friction between the candidates. Jane Ohlmeyer told the congregation of her plans to raise &euro;1billion in her decade as Provost, mostly from philanthropic sources, &ldquo;Hopefully &euro;400-&euro;600 million would come from our alumni and philanthropic sources, and this would give us the ability to invest this money on the ground levels.&rdquo;\n\nColm Kearney dismissed the &euro;1bn figure as &ldquo;magical&rdquo; and suggested that Ohlmeyer &ldquo;belongs upstairs&rdquo;, where on the first floor of the GMB, a Harry Potter table quiz was in progress. Kearney argued that it would be &ldquo;difficult to find a philanthropist who would throw money at a black hole&rdquo; referring to Trinity&rsquo;s accelerating debt levels.\nKearney described the Employment Control Framework, a government policy which restricts the hiring and promotion of staff in third-level institutions, as being a vicious assault on the University system in Ireland and pledged to combat its implementation. Fitzgerald, in response, suggested that Kearney should also be taking part in the Harry Potter table quiz. At one point or another, each of the candidates insinuated that another should be taking part in the table quiz.\nIn response to a question submitted through TimesOnline asking how Trinity could maintain a top 50 position in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, all candidates poured scorn on the methodologies of university rankings.\n\nPrendergast described university rankings as being &ldquo;rubbish,&rdquo; and recalled a French rankings system specifically designed to ensure high French achievement. All candidates yet maintained that, despite the inadequacies of the system, rankings did have a big effect on prospective students. Prendergast spoke of the excellent facilities College had to exploit. &ldquo;Trinity has an excellent academic staff and students,&rdquo; said Prendergast. &ldquo;There are so many fundamentals in college that are strong.&rdquo;\n\nWith the number of staff in College being reduced and the same amount of students coming in yearly, the candidates also discussed the possibility of re-introducing a cap on the number of students being allowed to study in Trinity. This motion was the only thing that all four agreed on, they said it would have to be looked into in the future to ensure the quality of teaching at Trinity. The University Philosophical Society President, Declan Meehan, in an angry exchange, said that radical reform was needed, &ldquo;Trinity is seen as Ireland&rsquo;s number one college, yet it has so many problems; from lazy library staff to an absolutely appalling IS Services. The incoming Provost needs to reform college services.&rdquo;\n\nThe only outsider, Des Fitzgerald from UCD added humour to the end of the debate, when each candidate was asked about their experience gained by running for the post he said that he would be the best leader UCD had ever seen.
