Germany in truth did not play as well as they could and it could be said that Joachim Low made some odd decisions in his starting team, altering a winning formula. The hero of the night was undeniably Mario Balotelli, who answered his critics with an all round display and two goals to boot. The other Mario, Gomez, was truly terrible for the 45 minutes that he was on the pitch. It seemed to add credence to the belief that he is a good goal-scorer but little else. When the going gets tough for his team he disappears, as evidenced in the match when he barely tried to close down defenders, trotting around up front.\n\nJoachim Low chose to reinstate Gomez to the starting line-up instead of Klose. In addition to this he brought in Toni Kroos, somewhat of a surprise considering Marco Reus&rsquo; good performance against Greece and his preference of Muller prior to that. It seemed that he was brought in, in an effort to stem the influence of the magnificent Pirlo in the Italian midfield. The gamble patently did not work. For Italy, Chiellini was brought in for Ignacio Abate who had picked up a knock in the previous game.\n\nEarly on Germany seemed most in control with Buffon having a few nervous moments when tested. However, as the game wore on the Italians seemed to manage their task. The midfield, especially Montolivo, putting themselves about and stifling the German attack. Montolivo and Cassano had some early shots from distance which Neuer dealt with well. With this new found dominance Italy scored. Cassano did well on the edge of the box, brushing off the weak tackle of Hummels to chip in a precise cross for Balotelli to power home with his head. The Azzuri took a one &ndash; nil lead after 20 minutes.\n\nGermany tried to respond and had a chance with Mesut Ozil but his shot was weak and easily saved by Buffon. Buffon had to do a lot more however to stop a dipping Khedira volley from twenty five yards. Straight from the resulting corner however Italy broke with deadly effect. The ball broke to Montolivo and he played a sumptuous ball over the top to Mario Balotelli who took down the ball. He struck the ball on the volley from the edge of the box with huge power and Neuer was helpless as it swerved right into the top corner. The goal was a terrific example of the talent which Balotelli has and the potential he has to be one of the best strikers in the world. Germany seemed to fall apart after this and their usually fluid style deserted them.\n\nAfter the break Reus and Klose came on for the ineffectual Gomez and Podolski. Reus had an immediate impact with his energy testing Buffon at his near post. Lahm also had a good chance but he blazed over after neat interplay. Again it took a while but Italy adjusted to the Germany play and again contained them easily. Reus again tested Buffon from a free-kick as he pushed the shot onto the bar. Italy too had chances to kill off the game. The energetic Marchisio had a chance to kill off the game but he pulled his shot wide after a good pass from Diamanti.\n\nGermany&rsquo;s play in trying to equalise became frantic and also in pushing up they left openings at the back and Marchisio again had the opportunity to kill off the game but pulled his shot wide when Di Natale was perhaps in a better position. Germany did get a late consolation from a Mesut Ozil penalty after a Balzaretti handball. The delight was evident on the Italian faces at the end of the match, as they now have the chance to lift their first trophy since the 2006 World Cup. The Italians were drastically under-appreciated coming into the competition, and it was believed that they would never progress this far. Despite the criticisms, they are now perched in as good a position as ever to undo the hopes of the Spanish attempt at three-in-a-row. As much as this was thought to be the time for the Germans, their squad is sufficiently young to allow them to compete for years to come.", "Imageurl": "11035", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "11034", "Heading": "Italy cruise to Euro final"}
