{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bernard Ryan</strong> | News staff</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Google has announced a three-year partnership with Trinity to develop a new project aimed at transforming computer science in Irish schools, particularly those who fall under the DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) scheme at second level. This &ldquo;schools of the future&rdquo; project, in which Google is investing &euro;1.5 million, is being undertaken in conjunction with the company&rsquo;s 10th anniversary in Ireland. It is hoped that it will aid Ireland's aim of becoming the &ldquo;Silicon Valley&rdquo; of Europe by supporting the next generation of computer science graduates.</p>\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_16574\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"384\"]<a href=\"http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/google-tcdinvestment4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-16574 \" alt=\"Dr Patrick Prendergast, provost of Trinity College Dublin; Ireland&rsquo;s Education Minister Ruairi Quinn, TD; and John Herlihy, head of Google Ireland.

This will provide teachers with assistance to increase the number of students with an interest in computer science courses at third-level.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project will also include specific supports which will be developed in order to drive educational and social change through these schools, something which has played an integral role in the reforming agenda of Minister Ruair\u00ed Quinn at the Department of Education. Speaking at the launch of the initiative, Minister Quinn said: \"I congratulate both Google and Trinity on this joint initiative. In the context of the major reforms in teaching and learning that I am implementing, I particularly welcome initiatives which can further enhance student outcomes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Since coming to office, I have instigated a number of radical changes in curriculum and teacher education designed to foster greater innovation and creativity in the classroom. I am sure that this project can contribute to that positive change. Interventions such as this are most effective when they are consistent with national policy and I look forward to the project leaders liaising with my Department and the Teaching Council in this regard.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As well as generating greater student interest in computer science-related courses, the project will also foster interest in computer programming among students through the provision of &ldquo;Raspberry Pis&rdquo;, credit card-sized computers that plug into a TV or keyboard, helping both teachers and students with programming. In addition, there will be a national coding competition for both teachers and students.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the launch, Trinity Provost Patrick Prendergast expressed his delight at the partnership with the global software giant. &ldquo;Trinity Access 21, made up of Trinity Access Programmes and Bridge 21, is a proven success and this sponsorship enables Trinity to make an evidence-based contribution to changing the education system, so that our teachers and students develop strong 21st century STEM skills.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"The project will be developed in consultation with key educational stakeholders and Trinity&rsquo;s School of Education which has welcomed this major investment and the opportunity to influence significant change in Irish education,&rdquo; Dr. Prendergast said.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">John Herlihy, head of Google Ireland, stated that Computer Science education is the fuel for 21st-century innovation and development.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;We hope that this project will encourage the next generation of computer scientists and technology leaders and will help drive a new wave of innovation. Every year, there is a 15pc growth in the number of people and machines, and by the end of the decade everyone on the planet could be on the internet.</p>\n&ldquo;Dublin is rightly known as the digital capital of Europe. If we are to maintain that position, computer science skills will become even more critical as companies create new business models through the cloud and the web.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "16574", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "16570", "Heading": "Google and TCD in joint venture to create 'European Silicon Valley'"}
