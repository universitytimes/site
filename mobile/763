The survey, designed specifically to be &ldquo;in line with the reasons cited for change of the University&rsquo;s governance structures,&rdquo; was carried out in March of 2010 in advance of a broader mid-term review process.\n\nThe survey contained nineteen positively-framed statements for agreement or disagreement in three sections entitled &ldquo;general&rdquo;, &ldquo;the formation of Schools&rdquo; and &ldquo;the formation of new Faculties&rdquo;.\u00a0Academics were given the chance to rank their agreement with the statement in a range of one to five; with one meaning &ldquo;strongly disagree&rdquo; and five meaning &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo;. There was also an option called &ldquo;unable to judge&rdquo; which was listed as zero.\n\nThe results were staggering. In not one of the 19 categories were the results positive.\u00a0The &ldquo;rating average&rdquo; for each category was negative and below the central option, number three, which was &ldquo;no significant change&rdquo;. The highest score for any category was for the statement &ldquo;there is greater opportunity for cross-College activity&rdquo;, which polled at an average of 2.54, almost exactly between &ldquo;disagree&rdquo; and &ldquo;no significant change&rdquo;. Alarmingly, however, seven of the nineteen category responses were between &ldquo;strongly disagree&rdquo; and &ldquo;disagree&rdquo;, with the lowest being &ldquo;budgets have been devolved sufficiently to simplify decision-making&rdquo;, which polled at 1.58.\n\nThe average of all of the poll scores - 2.15 - reflects the mood of the academics surveyed. The survey also showed pockets of resounding disapproval from academics, with over 30% &ldquo;strongly disagreeing&rdquo; with statements on the success of the policies for budget devolvement, simplified communication with College, time for research and teaching, duplication of tasks, connection with central decision-making processes and administrative support. The &ldquo;no significant change&rdquo; option polled at over 30% on issues like inter-institutional collaboration, cross-College academic activity, developing new academic\u00a0specialisations, growing and innovating inside disciplines, academic opportunities and accountability for educational and research outcomes.\n\nOn the other side, there were few positives for the management team. The highest score in the &ldquo;agree&rdquo; column was 28.2% for &ldquo;greater local management&rdquo; but only one other category came in at above 25%. The &ldquo;strongly agree&rdquo; option failed to record any double-digit scores, ranging from 0.7% of respondents on &ldquo;duplication of tasks has been removed&rdquo; to 4.6% on &ldquo;more control of academic planning&rdquo;.\n\nThe remit of the mid-term review as a whole was to &ldquo;consider the effectiveness&rdquo; of the multi-million euro restructuring project in three areas; devolution arrangements, communication structures and new administrative roles. The survey was carried out by a Steering Group comprising Prof. John O&rsquo;Hagan, Prof. Cecily Begley, Ms. Patricia Callaghan - the College's Academic Secretary - and Prof. John McGilp as Chair. The survey they created exactly matched the nine specific reasons given by College at the start of the process for the change of governance structures.\n\nMike Jennings, General Secretary of the Irish Federation of University Teachers (IFUT) spoke to\u00a0<em>The University Times</em> today about the story. &ldquo;My first reaction, regardless of the caveats, is that the overwhelming negativity should make people pause. Any exercise perceived so negatively must have limited chance of success. One of the biggest negative votes was in the area of &ldquo;more time for teaching and research&rdquo;. If the university isn&rsquo;t taking this into account, what is the purpose of the restructuring?&rdquo;\n\nIn fact, one of the nine stated aims of the restructuring process was to &ldquo;release academic time to focus on teaching and research&rdquo;. Among the other aims were simplifying communication and decision-making and the failure to address these issues was also highlighted by Mr. Jennings. &ldquo;Two of the highest negatives were on the issues of lack of clarity and duplication of tasks. That is what progressive restructuring should be about; making structures more efficient and clear.&rdquo;\n\nThe College Communications Office had &ldquo;nothing further to add&rdquo; to the correspondence of Professor John McGilp, Chair of the Steering Group, to his colleagues. Professor McGilp advised reading the survey in the context of a &ldquo;25% response rate&rdquo; and &ldquo;no test for bias&rdquo; being carried out on respondents.\n\nEven though College clearly expected a higher response from academics, Mr. Jennings said that a response rate at this level was not particularly low. &ldquo;If you got 40% responding in a survey, you would think that was very good. Usually when the likes of MRBI conduct polls they assume that those who don&rsquo;t respond, by-and-large, fall into the mould of everyone else who was taking the poll.&rdquo; &ldquo;But&rdquo;, he asked, &ldquo;even if the vast majority were indifferent, and fell into the &ldquo;no significant change&rdquo; category most of the time, why push ahead with something so polarising?&rdquo;\n\nThe Executive Office's restructuring project was expensive and ambitious. Its first review has cast serious doubt on the goals of further growth, innovation and creativity in a climate of greater accountability and simplified structures.", "Imageurl": "9070", "Thumb_nail": "http://shy-suzan.pagodabox.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Archive-CD-Books-launch-Robin-Adams-TCD-John-Hegarty-TCD-Brian-Donovan-Eneclann3", "ID": "763", "Heading": "Leaked survey damns restructuring"}
