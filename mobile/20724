{"Body": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\"><strong>Hannah Ryan</strong> | News Editor</span></p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">The youth wing of the Irish Labour Party, Labour Youth, organised a demonstration last Friday morning to protest the proposed cut to social welfare for under-26-year-olds announced in Budget 2014. The protest took place outside the D\u00e1il, following a similar protest last Wednesday by several youth groups, in which Labour also took part.</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Speaking to <em>The University Times</em>, Ciar\u00e1n Garrett, Recruitment Officer of the National Youth Executive (NYE, responsible for the day-to-day running of Labour Youth) and the organiser of Friday&rsquo;s event, commented: &ldquo;I am very happy with how [the protest] went, there was a great turnout.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">It was announced last Tuesday that, as part of Budget 2014, social welfare for job-seekers under the age of 26 will be cut, to &euro;100 for those aged 24 and under and &euro;144 for 25-year-olds. Labour Youth released a statement following the announcement, declaring this cut in social welfare to be &ldquo;regressive and counter-productive in terms of aiding the recovery of the Irish economy.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Asked if he is optimistic that Labour Youth can persuade the government to reverse this decision, Garrett said: &ldquo;I feel that we have a very strong chance if we just keep up the pressure. I urge young people to contact their TDs and say that they are unhappy with the cuts, as TDs may respond better to pressure from voters.&rdquo;</span>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.6;\">Labour Youth National Chairperson Aideen Carberry further stated last week that: &ldquo;It is also fundamentally unjust that young unemployed adults, who are eligible to vote and required to pay income tax, are expected to accept lesser payments than their older counterparts. It runs counter to the intergenerational solidarity that Irish society should be built on.</span>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&ldquo;Young people have suffered enough throughout the economic crisis. They suffer mass unemployment, emigration, little prospect of owning their own home in the near future and serious mental health problems. They are graduating from college with little prospect of work in their chosen field and are taking up work in low paid precarious employments in order to make ends meet.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Carberry continued, &ldquo;In my experience from talking to young people, they do not relish the idea of claiming social welfare. They want to work. They want to contribute to society. They want to be in a position where they can pay taxes and spend money in the local economy. Taking money out of their pockets will only depress the economy further and create further problems for this generation in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the group&rsquo;s plans to continue opposing the welfare cuts, Garrett stated: &ldquo;I am confident that the Labour Party are doing their best to get this cut reversed. We are hoping to meeting with T\u00e1naiste \u00c9amon Gilmore early this week to lobby him, and hopefully we will get some improvements from this meeting.&rdquo;</p>\r\nLabour Youth will also be taking part in the &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Not Leaving!&rdquo; assembly in Liberty Hall on November 9, along with new student movement Youth Lockout and other groups. The assembly, hosted by the Young Workers Network, aims &ldquo;to build a campaign that unites students, young workers and the unemployed to address the youth crisis, to produce a youth charter, which articulates demands to be placed on representative bodies, the state and society &ndash; and which articulates a divergent social vision from the path of austerity Ireland on behalf of young people, [and] to build a democratic infrastructure on the basis of this charter that can reinvigorate youth politics locally and nationally.&rdquo;", "Imageurl": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/1379622_10151675096127601_1221130078_n.jpg", "Thumb_nail": "http://universitytimes.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/utlogo.jpg", "ID": "20724", "Heading": "Labour Youth Challenges Government Cuts to Social Welfare"}
